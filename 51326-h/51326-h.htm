<h2>PREFACE<br />
<span style="font-size: 50%;">TO THE</span><br />
ENGLISH TRANSLATION</h2>

<p>The first English edition of this work was published in 1891, and
that a second edition is now called for is, we think, a sufficient
proof that the enthusiasm of the author for his science, and the
philosophical method of his teaching, have been duly appreciated
by English chemists.</p>

<p>In the scientific work to which Professor Mendeléeff's life
has been devoted, his continual endeavour has been to bring the
scattered facts of chemistry within the domain of law, and accordingly
in his teaching he endeavours to impress upon the student
the <i>principles</i> of the science, the generalisations, so far as they have
been discovered, under which the facts naturally group themselves.</p>

<p>Of those generalisations the periodic law is perhaps the most
important that has been put forward since the establishment of the
atomic theory. It is therefore interesting to note that Professor
Mendeléeff was led to its discovery in preparing the first Russian
edition of this book.</p>

<p>It is natural, too, that the further application and development
of that generalisation should be the principal feature of this, the
latest edition.</p>

<p>There are special difficulties in rendering the Russian language
into good English, and we are conscious that these have
not been entirely overcome. Doubtless also there are errors of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
statement which have escaped correction, but we believe that the
present edition will be found better in both respects than its predecessor.
We have thought it our duty as translators to give as
far as possible a faithful reproduction of Professor Mendeléeff's
work&mdash;the sixth Russian edition&mdash;without amplifying or modifying
his statements, and in this we have the author's approval.</p>

<p>Although other duties have prevented Mr. Greenaway from
undertaking the care of the present edition, he has been kind
enough to give us the benefit of his suggestions on several points.
We also wish to thank the Managers of the Royal Institution for
permission to reprint the lecture delivered at the Royal Institution
by Professor Mendeléeff (Appendix I.), and to the Council of the
Chemical Society for permission to reprint the Faraday lecture
which forms Appendix II.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we are indebted to Mr. F. Evershed, who has
given us much valuable assistance in revising the sheets for the
press.</p>

<h2>AUTHOR'S PREFACE<br />
<span style="font-size: 50%;">TO</span><br />
THE SIXTH RUSSIAN EDITION</h2>

<p>This work was written during the years 1868&ndash;1870, its object
being to acquaint the student not only with the methods of observation,
the experimental facts, and the laws of chemistry, but also
with the insight given by this science into the unchangeable substratum
underlying the varying forms of matter.</p>

<p>If statements of fact themselves depend upon the person who
observes them, how much more distinct is the reflection of the personality
of him who gives an account of methods and of philosophical
speculations which form the essence of science! For this reason there
will inevitably be much that is subjective in every objective exposition
of science. And as an individual production is only significant
in virtue of that which has preceded and that which is contemporary
with it, it resembles a mirror which in reflecting exaggerates the
size and clearness of neighbouring objects, and causes a person near
it to see reflected most plainly those objects which are on the side
to which it is directed. Although I have endeavoured to make my
book a true mirror directed towards the whole domain of chemical
changes, yet involuntarily those influences near to me have been the
most clearly reflected, the most brightly illuminated, and have tinted
the entire work with their colouring. In this way the chief peculiarity
of the book has been determined. Experimental and
practical data occupy their place, but the philosophical principles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
of our science form the chief theme of the work. In former times
sciences, like bridges, could only be built up by supporting them
on a few broad buttresses and long girders. In addition to the
exposition of the principles of chemistry, it has been my desire to
show how science has now been built up like a suspension bridge,
supported by the united strength of a number of slender, but
firmly-fixed, chains, which individually are of little strength, and
has thus been carried over difficulties which before appeared insuperable.
In comparing the science of the past, the present, and
the future, in placing the particulars of its restricted experiments
side by side with its aspirations after unbounded and infinite
truth, and in restraining myself from yielding to a bias towards
the most attractive path, I have endeavoured to incite in the reader
a spirit of inquiry, which, dissatisfied with speculative reasonings
alone, should subject every idea to experiment, encourage the habit
of stubborn work, and excite a search for fresh chains of evidence to
complete the bridge over the bottomless unknown. History proves
that it is possible by this means to avoid two equally pernicious
extremes, the Utopian&mdash;a visionary contemplation which proceeds
from a current of thought only&mdash;and the stagnant realism which
is content with bare facts. Sciences like chemistry, which deal
with ideas as well as with material substances, and create a possibility
of immediately verifying that which has been or may be
discovered or assumed, demonstrate at every step that the work
of the past has availed much, and that without it it would be
impossible to advance into the ocean of the unknown. They
also show the possibility of becoming acquainted with fresh
portions of this unknown, and compel us, while duly respecting
the teachings of history, to cast aside classical illusions, and to
engage in a work which not only gives mental satisfaction but is
also practically useful to all our fellow-creatures.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a><br /><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the desire to direct those thirsting for truth to the pure
source of the science of the forces acting throughout nature forms
the first and most important aim of this book. The time has arrived
when a knowledge of physics and chemistry forms as important
a part of education as that of the classics did two centuries
ago. In those days the nations which excelled in classical learning
stood foremost, just as now the most advanced are those which are
superior in the knowledge of the natural sciences, for they form
the strength and characteristic of our times. In following the above
and chief aim, I set myself a second object: to furnish a text-book
for an elementary knowledge of chemistry and so satisfy a want
which undoubtedly exists among students and those who have recourse
to chemistry either as a source of truth or welfare.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Hence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
although the fundamental object of this work was to express and
embrace the general chemical teaching of the present day from a
personal point of view, I have nevertheless striven throughout to
maintain such a level as would render the &lsquo;Principles of Chemistry&rsquo;
accessible to the beginner. Many aspects of this work are determined
by this combination of requirements which frequently differ
widely. An issue was only possible under one condition, <i>i.e.</i> not
to be carried away by what appears to be a plausible theory in explaining
individual facts and to always endeavour to transmit the
simple truth of a given fact, extracting it from the vast store of the
literature of the subject and from tried personal experience. In
publishing a new edition of this work I have striven to add any facts
of importance recently discovered<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and to revise the former edition
in the above spirit. With this object I have entirely gone over this
edition, and a comparison of it with the former one will show that
the additions and alterations have cost as much labour as many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
chapters of the work. I also wished to show in an elementary
treatise on chemistry the striking advantages gained by the
application of the periodic law, which I first saw in its entirety in
the year 1869 when I was engaged in writing the first edition of
this book, in which, indeed, the law was first enunciated. At that
time, however, this law was not established so firmly as now, when
so many of its consequences have been verified by the researches of
numerous chemists, and especially by Roscoe, Lecoq de Boisbaudran,
Nilson, Brauner, Thorpe, Carnelley, Laurie, Winkler, and others.
The, to me, unexpectedly rapid success with which the teaching
of the periodicity of the elements has spread in our science, and
perhaps also, the perseverance with which I collected in this work,
and upon a new plan, the most important data respecting the elements
and their mutual relations, explained sufficiently the fact
that the former (5th, 1889) edition of my work has been translated
into English<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and German<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and is being translated into
French.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Deeply touched by the favourable opinions expressed
by English men of science upon my book, I ascribe them chiefly to
the periodic law placed at the basis of my treatise and especially of
the second part of the book, which contains a large amount of data
having a special and sometimes quite unexpected, bearing from
the point of view of this law. As the entire scheme of this work
is subordinated to the law of periodicity, which may be illustrated in
a tabular form by placing the elements in series, groups, and periods,
two such tables are given at the end of this preface.</p>

<p>In this the sixth edition I have not altered any essential feature
of the original work, and have retained those alterations which
were introduced into the fifth edition.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I have, however, added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
many newly discovered facts, and in this respect it is necessary to
say a few words. Although all aspects of the simplest chemical
relations are as far as possible equally developed in this book, yet
on looking back I see that I have, nevertheless, given most
attention to the so-called indefinite compounds examples of which
may be seen in solutions. I recur repeatedly to them, and to
all the latest data respecting them, for in them I see a starting
point for the future progress of our science and to them I
affiliate numerous instances of definite compounds, beginning
with alloys and silicates and ending with complex acids. There
are two reasons for this. In the first place, this subject has
deeply interested me from my youth; I have devoted a portion of
my own researches to it, and therefore it occupied an important
position even in the first edition of my book; besides which all that
has been subsequently accomplished in our science, especially during
the last five or six years, shows that at the present day an interest
in these questions plays an important part in the minds of a
large circle of contemporary workers in chemistry. This personal
attachment, if I may so call it, to the question of solutions and
such indefinite compounds, must involuntarily have impressed itself
upon my work, and in the later editions I have even had to strive
not to give this subject a greater development than previously,
so great was the material accumulated, which however does not
yet give us the right to consider even the most elementary questions
respecting solutions as solved. Thus, we cannot yet say what a
solution really is. My own view is that a solution is a homogeneous
liquid system of unstable dissociating compounds of
the solvent with the substance dissolved. But although such a
theory explains much to me, I cannot consider my opinion
as proved, and therefore give it with some reserve as one of
several hypotheses.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> As a subject yet far from solved, I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
naturally have ignored it, or only mentioned it cursorily, but such a
treatment of solutions, although usual in elementary treatises on
chemistry, would not have answered my views upon the subject of
our science, and I wished that the reader might find in my book
beyond everything an expression of all that a study of the subject
built up for me. If in solutions I see and can frequently prove
distinct evidences of the existence of those definite compounds
which form the more generalised province of chemical data, I
could not refrain from going into certain details respecting
solutions; otherwise, there would have remained no trace of that
general idea, that in them we have only a certain instance of ordinary
definite or atomic compounds, subject to Dalton's laws.
Having long had this idea, I wished to impress it upon the
reader of my book, and it is this desire which forms the second of
those chief reasons why I recur so frequently to solutions in this
work. At present, my ideas respecting solutions are shared by
few, but I trust that by degrees the instances I give will pave
the way for their general recognition, and it is my hope that they
may find adherents among those of my readers who are in a
position to work out by experiment this difficult but highly
interesting problem.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I desire to record my thanks to V. D. Sapogenikoff,
who has corrected the proofs of the whole of this edition and compiled
the indexes which greatly facilitate the search for those
details which are scattered throughout the work.</p>

<p>Footnotes:</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Chemistry, like every other science, is at once a means and an end. It is a
means of attaining certain practical results. Thus, by its assistance, the obtaining
of matter in its various forms is facilitated; it shows new possibilities of availing
ourselves of the forces of nature, indicates the methods of preparing many substances,
points out their properties, &amp;c. In this sense chemistry is closely connected
with the work of the manufacturer and the artisan, its sphere is active, and is a
means of promoting general welfare. Besides this honourable vocation, chemistry
has another. With it, as with every other elaborated science, there are many lofty
aspirations, the contemplation of which serves to inspire its workers and adherents.
This contemplation comprises not only the principal data of the science, but also
the generally-accepted deductions, and also hypotheses which refer to phenomena
as yet but imperfectly known. In this latter sense scientific contemplation varies
much with times and persons, it bears the stamp of creative power, and embraces
the highest forms of scientific progress. In that pure enjoyment experienced
on approaching to the ideal, in that eagerness to draw aside the veil
from the hidden truth, and even in that discord which exists between the various
workers, we ought to see the surest pledges of further scientific progress. Science
thus advances, discovering new truths, and at the same time obtaining practical
results. The edifice of science not only requires material, but also a plan, and
necessitates the work of preparing the materials, putting them together, working
out the plans and the symmetrical proportions of the various parts. To conceive,
understand, and grasp the whole symmetry of the scientific edifice, including its
unfinished portions, is equivalent to tasting that enjoyment only conveyed by the
highest forms of beauty and truth. Without the material, the plan alone is but
a castle in the air&mdash;a mere possibility; whilst the material without a plan is but
useless matter. All depends on the concordance of the materials with the plan and
execution, and the general harmony thereby attained. In the work of science, the
artisan, architect, and creator are very often one and the same individual; but
sometimes, as in other walks of life, there is a difference between them; sometimes
the plan is preconceived, sometimes it follows the preparation and accumulation
of the raw material. Free access to the edifice of science is not only allowed to
those who devised the plan, worked out the detailed drawings, prepared the
materials, or piled up the brickwork, but also to all those who are desirous of
making a close acquaintance with the plan, and wish to avoid dwelling in the
vaults or in the garrets where the useless lumber is stored.</p>

<p>Knowing how contented, free, and joyful is life in the realm of science, one
fervently wishes that many would enter its portals. On this account many
pages of this treatise are unwittingly stamped with the earnest desire that the
habits of chemical contemplation which I have endeavoured to instil into the
minds of my readers will incite them to the further study of science. Science will
then flourish in them and by them, on a fuller acquaintance not only with that
little which is enclosed within the narrow limits of my work, but with the further
learning which they must imbibe in order to make themselves masters of our
science and partakers in its further advancement.</p>

<p>Those who enlist in the cause of science have no reason to fear when they
remember the urgent need for practical workers in the spheres of agriculture, arts,
and manufacture. By summoning adherents to the work of theoretical chemistry,
I am confident that I call them to a most useful labour, to the habit of dealing
correctly with nature and its laws, and to the possibility of becoming truly practical
men. In order to become actual chemists, it is necessary for beginners to be well
and closely acquainted with three important branches of chemistry&mdash;analytical,
organic, and theoretical. That part of chemistry which is dealt with in this
treatise is only the groundwork of the edifice. For the learning and development
of chemistry in its truest and fullest sense, beginners ought, in the first place, to
turn their attention to the practical work of analytical chemistry; in the second
place, to practical and theoretical acquaintance with some special chemical question,
studying the original treatises of the investigators of the subject (at first,
under the direction of experienced teachers), because in working out particular
facts the faculty of judgment and of correct criticism becomes sharpened; in the
third place, to a knowledge of current scientific questions through the special
chemical journals and papers, and by intercourse with other chemists. The time
has come to turn aside from visionary contemplation, from platonic aspirations,
and from classical verbosity, and to enter the regions of actual labour for the
common weal, to prove that the study of science is not only air excellent education
for youth, but that it instils the virtues of industry and veracity, and creates solid
national wealth, material and mental, which without it would be unattainable.
Science, which deals with the infinite, is itself without bounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> I recommend those who are commencing the study of chemistry with my
book <i>to first read only what is printed in the large type</i>, because in that part I
have endeavoured to concentrate all the fundamental, indispensable knowledge
required for that study. In the footnotes, printed in small type (which should be
read only after the large text has been mastered), certain details are discussed;
they are either further examples, or debatable questions on existing ideas which
I thought useful to lay before those entering into the sphere of science, or certain
historical and technical details which might be withdrawn from the fundamental
portion of the book. Without intending to attain in my treatise to the completeness
of a work of reference, I have still endeavoured to express the principal
developments of science as they concern the chemical elements viewed in that
aspect in which they appeared to me after long continued study of the subject and
participation in the contemporary advance of knowledge.</p>

<p>I have also placed my personal views, suppositions, and arguments in the footnotes,
which are chiefly designed for details and references. But I have endeavoured
to avoid here, as in the text, not only all that I consider doubtful, but also those
details which belong either to special branches of chemistry (for instance, to
analytical, organic, physical, theoretical, physiological, agricultural, or technical
chemistry), or to different branches of natural science which are more and more
coming into closer and closer contact with chemistry. Chemistry, I am convinced,
must occupy a place among the natural sciences side by side with mechanics; for
mechanics treats of matter as a system of ponderable points having scarcely any
individuality and only standing in a certain state of mobile equilibrium. For
chemistry, matter is an entire world of life, with an infinite variety of individuality
both in the elements and in their combinations. In studying the general
uniformity from a mechanical point of view, I think that the highest point of
knowledge of nature cannot be attained without taking into account the individuality
of things in which chemistry is set to seek for general higher laws.
Mechanics may be likened to the science of statesmanship, chemistry to the sciences
of jurisprudence and sociology. The general universe could not be built up without
the particular individual universe, and would be a dry abstract were it not enlivened
by the real variety of the individual world. Mechanics forms the classical basis of
natural philosophy, while chemistry, as a comparatively new and still young science,
already strives to&mdash;and will, in the future introduce a new, living aspect into
the philosophy of nature; all the more as chemistry alone is never at rest or anywhere
dead&mdash;its vital action has universal sway, and inevitably determines the
general aspect of the universe. Just as the microscope and telescope enlarge the
scope of vision, and discover life in seeming immobility, so chemistry, in discovering
and striving to discern the life of the invisible world of atoms and molecules
and their ultimate limit of divisibility, will clearly introduce new and important
problems into our conception of nature. And I think that its <i>rôle</i>, which is now
considerable, will increase more and more in the future; that is, I think that in
its further development it will occupy a place side by side with mechanics for the
comprehension of the secrets of nature. But here we require some second Newton;
and I have no doubt that he will soon appear.</p></div>

placed far more firmly in it than in the former editions. The subject-matter was
also divided into text and footnotes, which contained details unnecessary for a first
acquaintance with chemistry. The fifth edition sold out sooner than I expected,
so that instead of issuing supplements (containing the latest discoveries in
chemistry), as I had proposed, I was obliged to publish the present entirely new

<h2><span style="font-size: 125%;">PRINCIPLES OF CHEMISTRY</span><br /><br />
INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The study of natural science, whose rapid development dates from
the days of Galileo (&#8224;1642) and Newton (&#8224;1727), and its closer application
to the external universe<a name="FNanchor_1_9" id="FNanchor_1_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_9" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> led to the separation of Chemistry as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
particular branch of natural philosophy, not only owing to the increasing
store of observations and experiments relating to the mutual
transformations of substances, but also, and more especially, because
in addition to gravity, cohesion, heat, light and electricity it became
necessary to recognise the existence of particular internal forces in the
ultimate parts of all substances, forces which make themselves manifest
in the transformations of substances into one another, but remain
hidden (latent) under ordinary circumstances, and whose existence cannot
therefore be directly apprehended, and so for a long time remained
unrecognised. The primary object of chemistry is the study of the
homogeneous substances<a name="FNanchor_2_10" id="FNanchor_2_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_10" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of which all the objects of the universe are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
made up, with the transformations of these substances into each other,
and with the phenomena<a name="FNanchor_3_11" id="FNanchor_3_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_11" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> which accompany such transformations.
Every chemical change or reaction,<a name="FNanchor_4_12" id="FNanchor_4_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_12" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> as it is called, can only take place
under a condition of most intimate and close contact of the re-acting
substances,<a name="FNanchor_5_13" id="FNanchor_5_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_13" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and is determined by the forces proper to the smallest
invisible particles (molecules) of matter. We must distinguish three
chief classes of chemical transformations.</p>

<p>1. <i>Combination</i> is a reaction in which the union of two substances
yields a new one, or in general terms, from a given number of substances,
a lesser number is obtained. Thus, by heating a mixture of
iron and sulphur<a name="FNanchor_6_14" id="FNanchor_6_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_14" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> a single new substance is produced, iron sulphide, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
which the constituent substances cannot be distinguished even by
the highest magnifying power. Before the reaction, the iron could be
separated from the mixture by a magnet, and the sulphur by dissolving
it in certain oily liquids;<a name="FNanchor_7_15" id="FNanchor_7_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_15" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in general, before combination they might
be mechanically separated from each other, but after combination both
substances penetrate into each other, and are then neither mechanically
separable nor individually distinguishable. As a rule, reactions of
direct combination are accompanied by an evolution of heat, and the
common case of combustion, evolving heat, consists in the combination
of combustible substances with a portion (oxygen) of the atmosphere,
the gases and vapours contained in the smoke being the products of
combination.</p>

<p>2. Reactions of <i>decomposition</i> are cases the reverse of those of
combination, that is, in which one substance gives two&mdash;or, in general, a
given number of substances a greater number. Thus, by heating wood
(and also coal and many animal or vegetable substances) without access
to air, a combustible gas, a watery liquid, tar, and carbon are obtained.
It is in this way that tar, illuminating gas, and charcoal are prepared
on a large scale.<a name="FNanchor_8_16" id="FNanchor_8_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_16" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> All limestones, for example, flagstones, chalk, or
marble, are decomposed by heating to redness into lime and a peculiar
gas called carbonic anhydride. A similar decomposition, taking place,
however, at a much lower temperature, proceeds with the green copper
carbonate which is contained in natural malachite. This example will
be studied more in detail presently. Whilst heat is evolved in the
ordinary reactions of combination, it is, on the contrary, absorbed in
the reactions of decomposition.</p>

<p>3. The third class of chemical reactions&mdash;where the number of
re-acting substances is equal to the number of substances formed&mdash;may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
be considered as a simultaneous decomposition and combination. If,
for instance, two compounds A and B are taken and they react on each
other to form the substances C and D, then supposing that A is
decomposed into D and E, and that E combines with B to form C, we
have a reaction in which two substances A, or D E, and B were taken
and two others C, or E B, and D were produced. Such reactions
ought to be placed under the general term of reactions of &lsquo;<i>rearrangement</i>,&rsquo;
and the particular case where two substances give two fresh
ones, reactions of &lsquo;<i>substitution</i>.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_9_17" id="FNanchor_9_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_17" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Thus, if a piece of iron be immersed
in a solution of blue vitriol (copper sulphate), copper is formed&mdash;or,
rather, separated out, and green vitriol (iron sulphate, which only
differs from the blue vitriol in that the iron has replaced the copper) is
obtained in solution. In this manner iron may be coated with copper,
so also copper with silver; such reactions are frequently made use of
in practice.</p>

<p>The majority of the chemical changes which occur in nature and
are made use of technically are very complicated, as they consist of an
association of many separate and simultaneous combinations, decompositions,
and replacements. It is chiefly due to this natural complexity
of chemical phenomena that for so many centuries chemistry did not
exist as an exact science; that is so say, that although many chemical
changes were known and made use of,<a name="FNanchor_10_18" id="FNanchor_10_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_18" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> yet their real nature was
unknown, nor could they be predicted or directed at will. Another
reason for the tardy progress of chemical knowledge is the participation
of gaseous substances, especially air, in many reactions. The true
comprehension of air as a ponderable substance, and of gases in general
as peculiar elastic and dispersive states of matter, was only arrived at
in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and it was only after this
that the transformations of substances could form a science. Up to
that time, without understanding the invisible and yet ponderable
gaseous and vaporous states of substances, it was impossible to obtain
any fundamental chemical evidence, because gases escaped from notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
between the reacting and resultant substances. It is easy from the
impression conveyed to us by the phenomena we observe to form the
opinion that matter is created and destroyed: a whole mass of trees
burn, and there only remains a little charcoal and ash, whilst from one
small seed there grows little by little a majestic tree. In one case
matter seems to be destroyed, and in the other to be created. This
conclusion is arrived at because the formation or consumption of gases,
being under the circumstances invisible to the eye, is not observed.
When wood burns it undergoes a chemical change into gaseous
products, which escape as smoke. A very simple experiment will
prove this. By collecting the smoke it may be observed that it
contains gases which differ entirely from air, being incapable of
supporting combustion or respiration. These gases may be weighed,
and it will then be seen that their weight exceeds that of the wood
taken. This increase in weight arises from the fact that, in burning,
the component parts of the wood combine with a portion of the air; in
like manner iron increases in weight by rusting. In burning gunpowder
its substance is not destroyed, but only converted into gases and
smoke. So also in the growth of a tree; the seed does not increase in
mass of itself and from itself, but grows because it absorbs gases from
the atmosphere and sucks water and substances dissolved therein from
the earth through its roots. The sap and solid substances which give
plants their form are produced from these absorbed gases and liquids
by complicated chemical processes. The gases and liquids are converted
into solid substances by the plants themselves. Plants not only do
not increase in size, but die, in a gas which does not contain the
constituents of air. When moist substances dry they decrease in weight;
when water evaporates we know that it does not disappear, but will
return from the atmosphere as rain, dew, and snow. When water is
absorbed by the earth, it does not disappear there for ever, but
accumulates somewhere underground, from whence it afterwards flows
forth as a spring. Thus matter does not disappear and is not created,
but only undergoes various physical and chemical transformations&mdash;that
is to say, changes its locality and form. Matter remains on the
earth in the same quantity as before; in a word it is, so far as we are
concerned, everlasting. It was difficult to submit this simple and
primary truth of chemistry to investigation, but when once made clear
it rapidly spread, and now seems as natural and simple as many truths
which have been acknowledged for ages. Mariotte and other savants
of the seventeenth century already suspected the existence of the law
of the indestructibility of matter, but they made no efforts to express
it or to apply it to the requirements of science. The experiments by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
means of which this simple law was arrived at were made during the
latter half of the last century by the founder of modern chemistry,
<span class="smcap">Lavoisier</span>, the French Academician and tax farmer. The numerous
experiments of this savant were conducted with the aid of the balance,
which is the only means of directly and accurately determining the
quantity of matter.</p>

<p>Lavoisier found, by weighing all the substances, and even the
apparatus, used in every experiment, and then weighing the substances
obtained after the chemical change, that the sum of the weights of the
substances formed was always equal to the sum of the weights of the
substances taken; or, in other words: <span class="smcap">Matter is not created and
does not disappear</span>, or that, <i>matter is everlasting</i>. This expression
naturally includes a hypothesis, but our only aim in using it is to
concisely express the following lengthy period&mdash;That in all experiments,
and in all the investigated phenomena of nature, it has never been
observed that the weight of the substances formed was less or greater
(as far as accuracy of weighing permits<a name="FNanchor_11_19" id="FNanchor_11_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_19" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>) than the weight of the substances
originally taken, and as weight is proportional to mass<a name="FNanchor_11_BIS_20" id="FNanchor_11_BIS_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_20" class="fnanchor">[11 bis]</a> or
quantity of matter, it follows that no one has ever succeeded in observing
a disappearance of matter or its appearance in fresh quantities.
The law of the indestructibility of matter endows all chemical investigations
with exactitude, as, on its basis, an equation may be formed for
every chemical reaction. If in any reaction the weights of the substances
taken be designated by the letters A, B, C, &amp;c., and the
weights of the substances formed by the letters M, N, O, &amp;c., then</p>

<p class="title">A + B + C + ... ... ... = M + N + O + ... ... ...</p>

<p class="noindent">Therefore, should the weight of one of the re-acting or resultant substances
be unknown, it may be determined by solving the equation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
The chemist, in applying the law of the indestructibility of matter,
and in making use of the chemical balance, must never lose sight of
any one of the re-acting or resultant substances. Should such an over-sight
be made, it will at once be remarked that the sum of the weights
of the substances taken is unequal to the sum of the weights of the
substances formed. All the progress made by chemistry during the
end of the last, and in the present, century is entirely and immovably
founded on the law of the indestructibility of matter. It is absolutely
necessary in beginning the study of chemistry to become familiar with
the simple truth which is expressed by this law, and for this purpose
several examples elucidating its application will now be cited.</p>

<p>1. It is well known that iron rusts in damp air,<a name="FNanchor_12_21" id="FNanchor_12_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_21" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and that when
heated to redness in air it becomes coated with scoria (oxide), having,
like rust, the appearance of an earthy substance resembling some of the
iron ores from which metallic iron is extracted. If the iron is weighed
before and after the formation of the scoria or rust, it will be found
that the metal has increased in weight during the operation.<a name="FNanchor_13_22" id="FNanchor_13_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_22" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It
can easily be proved that this increase in weight is accomplished at
the expense of the atmosphere, and mainly, as Lavoisier proved, at the
expense of that portion which is called oxygen. In fact, in a vacuum,
or in gases which do not contain oxygen, for instance, in hydrogen or
nitrogen, the iron neither rusts nor becomes coated with scoria. Had
the iron not been weighed, the participation of the oxygen of the atmosphere
in its transformation into an earthy substance might have easily
passed unnoticed, as was formerly the case, when phenomena like the
above were, for this reason, misunderstood. It is evident from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
law of the indestructibility of matter that as the iron increases in
weight in its conversion into rust, the latter must be a more complex
substance than the iron itself, and its formation is due to a reaction of
combination. We might form an entirely wrong opinion about it, and
might, for instance, consider rust to be a simpler substance than iron,
and explain the formation of rust as the removal of something from
the iron. Such, indeed, was the general opinion prior to Lavoisier,
when it was held that iron contained a certain unknown substance
called &lsquo;phlogiston,&rsquo; and that rust was iron deprived of this supposed
substance.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Apparatus for the decomposition of red mercury oxide.</p></div>

<p>2. Copper carbonate (in the form of a powder, or as the well-known
green mineral called &lsquo;malachite,&rsquo; which is used for making ornaments,
or as an ore for the extraction of copper) changes into a black substance
called &lsquo;copper oxide&rsquo; when heated to redness.<a name="FNanchor_14_23" id="FNanchor_14_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_23" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> This black
substance is also obtained by heating copper to redness in air&mdash;that is,
it is the scoria or oxidation product of copper. The weight of the
black oxide of copper left is less than that of the copper carbonate
originally taken, and therefore we consider the reaction which occurred
to have been one of decomposition, and that by it something was separated
from the green copper carbonate, and, in fact, by closing the orifice
of the vessel in which the copper carbonate is heated with a well-fitting
cork, through which a gas delivery tube<a name="FNanchor_15_24" id="FNanchor_15_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_24" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> passes whose end is
immersed under water, it will be observed that on heating, a gas is
formed which bubbles through the water. This gas can be easily
collected, as will presently be described, and it will be found to essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
differ from air in many respects; for instance, a burning taper
is extinguished in it as if it had been plunged into water. If weighing
had not proved to us that some substance had been separated, the
formation of the gas might easily have escaped our notice, for it is
colourless and transparent like air, and is therefore evolved without
any striking feature. The carbonic anhydride evolved may be weighed,<a name="FNanchor_16_25" id="FNanchor_16_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_25" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
and it will be seen that the sum of the weights of the black copper
oxide and carbonic anhydride is equal to the weight of the copper
carbonate<a name="FNanchor_17_26" id="FNanchor_17_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_26" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> originally taken, and thus by carefully following out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
various stages of all chemical reactions we arrive at a confirmation of
the law of the indestructibility of matter.</p>

<p>3. Red mercury oxide (which is formed as mercury rust by heating
mercury in air) is decomposed like copper carbonate (only by heating
more slowly and at a somewhat higher temperature), with the formation
of the peculiar gas, oxygen. For this purpose the mercury oxide is
placed in a glass tube or retort,<a name="FNanchor_18_27" id="FNanchor_18_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_27" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> to which a gas delivery tube is
attached by means of a cork. This tube is bent downwards, as shown
in the drawing (Fig. <a href="#fig_1">1</a>). The open end of the gas delivery tube is immersed
in a vessel filled with water, called a pneumatic trough.<a name="FNanchor_19_28" id="FNanchor_19_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_28" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the gas begins to be evolved in the retort it is obliged, having no other
outlet, to escape through the gas delivery tube into the water in the
pneumatic trough, and therefore its evolution will be rendered visible
by the bubbles coming from this tube. In heating the retort containing
the mercury oxide, the air contained in the apparatus is first partly
expelled, owing to its expansion by heat, and then the peculiar gas
called &lsquo;oxygen&rsquo; is evolved, and may be easily collected as it comes off.
For this purpose a vessel (an ordinary cylinder, as in the drawing) is
filled quite full with water and its mouth closed; it is then inverted
and placed in this position under the water in the trough; the mouth
is then opened. The cylinder will remain full of water&mdash;that is, the
water will remain at a higher level in it than in the surrounding vessel,
owing to the atmospheric pressure. The atmosphere presses on the
surface of the water in the trough, and prevents the water from flowing
out of the cylinder. The mouth of the cylinder is placed over the
end of the gas delivery tube,<a name="FNanchor_20_29" id="FNanchor_20_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_29" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and the bubbles issuing from it will rise
into the cylinder and displace the water contained in it. Gases are
generally collected in this manner. When a sufficient quantity of gas
has accumulated in the cylinder it can be clearly shown that it is not
air, but another gas which is distinguished by its capacity for vigorously
supporting combustion. In order to show this, the cylinder is closed,
under water, and removed from the bath; its mouth is then turned upwards,
and a smouldering taper plunged into it. As is well known, a
smouldering taper will be extinguished in air, but in the gas which
is given off from red mercury oxide it burns clearly and vigorously,
showing the property possessed by this gas for supporting combustion
more energetically than air, and thus enabling it to be distinguished
from the latter. It may be observed in this experiment that, besides
the formation of oxygen, metallic mercury is formed, which, volatilising
at the high temperature required for the reaction, condenses on the
cooler parts of the retort as a mirror or in globules. Thus two substances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
mercury and oxygen, are obtained by heating red mercury
oxide. In this reaction, from one substance, two new substances are
produced&mdash;that is, a decomposition has taken place. The means of
collecting and investigating gases were known before Lavoisier's time,
but he first showed the real part they played in the processes of many
chemical changes which before his era were either wrongly understood
(as will be afterwards explained) or were not explained at all, but only
observed in their superficial aspects. This experiment on red mercury
oxide has a special significance in the history of chemistry contemporary
with Lavoisier, because the oxygen gas which is here evolved is
contained in the atmosphere, and plays a most important part in
nature, especially in the respiration of animals, in combustion in air,
and in the formation of rusts or scoriæ (earths, as they were then
called) from metals&mdash;that is, of earthy substances, like the ores from
which metals are extracted.</p>

<p>4. In order to illustrate by experiment one more example of
chemical change and the application of the law of the indestructibility
of matter, we will consider the reaction between common table salt
and lunar caustic, which is well known from its use in cauterising
wounds. By taking a clear solution of each and mixing them together,
it will at once be observed that a solid white substance is formed,
which settles to the bottom of the vessel, and is insoluble in water.
This substance may be separated from the solution by filtering; it is
then found to be an entirely different substance from either of those
taken originally in the solutions. This is at once evident from the
fact that it does not dissolve in water. On evaporating the liquid
which passed through the filter, it will be found to contain a new substance
unlike either table salt or lunar caustic, but, like them, soluble
in water. Thus table salt and lunar caustic, two substances soluble in
water, produced, by their mutual chemical action, two new substances,
one insoluble in water, and the other remaining in solution. Here,
from two substances, two others are obtained, consequently there
occurred a reaction of substitution. The water served only to convert
the re-acting substances into a liquid and mobile state. If the lunar
caustic and salt be dried<a name="FNanchor_21_30" id="FNanchor_21_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_30" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and weighed, and if about 58&frac12; grams<a name="FNanchor_22_31" id="FNanchor_22_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_31" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
salt and 170 grams of lunar caustic be taken, then 143&frac12; grams of insoluble
silver chloride and 85 grams of sodium nitrate will be obtained.
The sum of the weights of the re-acting and resultant substances are
seen to be similar and equal to 228&frac12; grams, which necessarily follows
from the law of the indestructibility of matter.</p>

<p>Accepting the truth of the above law, the question naturally arises
as to whether there is any limit to the various chemical transformations,
or are they unrestricted in number&mdash;that is to say, is it possible
from a given substance to obtain an equivalent quantity of any other
substance? In other words, does there exist a perpetual and infinite
change of one kind of material into every other kind, or is the cycle
of these transformations limited? This is the second essential problem
of Chemistry, a question of quality of matter, and one, it is evident,
which is more complicated than the question of quantity. It cannot
be solved by a mere superficial glance at the subject. Indeed, on
seeing how all the varied forms and colours of plants are built up from
air and the elements of the soil, and how metallic iron can be transformed
into colours such as inks and Prussian blue, we might be led
to think that there is no end to the qualitative changes to which
matter is susceptible. But, on the other hand, the experiences of
everyday life compel us to acknowledge that food cannot be made out
of a stone, or gold out of copper. Thus a definite answer can only be
looked for in a close and diligent study of the subject, and the problem
has been resolved in different way at different times. In ancient times
the opinion most generally held was that everything visible was composed
of four elements&mdash;Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. The origin of
this doctrine can be traced far back into the confines of Asia, whence
it was handed down to the Greeks, and most fully expounded by
Empedocles, who lived before 460 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> This doctrine was not the
result of exact research, but apparently owes its origin to the clear
division of bodies into gases (like air), liquids (like water), and solids
(like the earth). The Arabs appear to have been the first who
attempted to solve the question by experimental methods, and they
introduced, through Spain, the taste for the study of similar problems
into Europe, where from that time there appear many adepts in
chemistry, which was considered as an unholy art, and called &lsquo;alchemy.&rsquo;
As the alchemists were ignorant of any exact law which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
could guide them in their researches, they obtained most anomalous
results. Their chief service to chemistry was that they made a
number of experiments, and discovered many new chemical transformations;
but it is well known how they solved the fundamental
problem of chemistry. Their view may be taken as a positive acknowledgment
of the infinite transmutability of matter, for they aimed at
discovering the Philosopher's Stone, capable of converting everything
into gold and diamonds, and of making the old young again. This
solution of the question was afterwards completely overthrown, but it
must not, for this reason, be thought that the hopes held by the
alchemists were only the fruit of their imaginations. The first
chemical experiments might well lead them to their conclusions. They
took, for instance, the bright metallic mineral galena, and extracted
metallic lead from it. Thus they saw that from a metallic substance
which is unfitted for use they could obtain another metallic substance
which is ductile and valuable for many technical purposes. Furthermore,
they took this lead and obtained silver, a still more valuable
metal, from it. Thus they might easily conclude that it was possible
to ennoble metals by means of a whole series of transmutations&mdash;that
is to say, to obtain from them those which are more and more precious.
Having got silver from lead, they assumed that it would be possible to
obtain gold from silver. The mistake they made was that they never
weighed or measured the substances used or produced in their experiments.
Had they done so, they would have learnt that the weight of
the lead was much less than that of the galena from which it was
obtained, and the weight of the silver infinitesimal compared with that
of the lead. Had they looked more closely into the process of the extraction
of the silver from lead (and silver at the present time is chiefly
obtained from the lead ores) they would have seen that the lead does
not change into silver, but that it only contains a certain small quantity
of it, and this amount having once been separated from the lead
it cannot by any further operation give more. The silver which the
alchemists extracted from the lead was in the lead, and was not obtained
by a chemical change of the lead itself. This is now well known
from experiment, but the first view of the nature of the process was
very likely to be an erroneous one.<a name="FNanchor_23_32" id="FNanchor_23_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_32" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> The methods of research adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
by the alchemists could give but little success, for they did not set themselves
clear and simple questions whose answers would aid them to make
further progress. Thus though they did not arrive at any exact law,
they left nevertheless numerous and useful experimental data as an
inheritance to chemistry; they investigated, in particular, the transformations
proper to metals, and for this reason chemistry was for
long afterwards entirely confined to the study of metallic substances.</p>

<p>In their researches, the alchemists frequently made use of two
chemical processes which are now termed &lsquo;reduction&rsquo; and &lsquo;oxidation.&rsquo;
The rusting of metals, and in general their conversion from a metallic
into an earthy form, is called &lsquo;oxidation,&rsquo; whilst the extraction of a
metal from an earthy substance is called &lsquo;reduction.&rsquo; Many metals&mdash;for
instance, iron, lead, and tin&mdash;are oxidised by heating in air alone,
and may be again reduced by heating with carbon. Such oxidised
metals are found in the earth, and form the majority of metallic ores.
The metals, such as tin, iron, and copper, may be extracted from these
ores by heating them together with carbon. All these processes were
well studied by the alchemists. It was afterwards shown that all
earths and minerals are formed of similar metallic rusts or oxides, or
of their combinations. Thus the alchemists knew of two forms of
chemical changes: the oxidation of metals and the reduction of the
oxides so formed into metals. The explanation of the nature of these
two classes of chemical phenomena was the means for the discovery
of the most important chemical laws. The first hypothesis on their
nature is due to Becker, and more particularly to Stahl, a surgeon
to the King of Prussia. Stahl writes in his &lsquo;Fundamenta Chymiæ,&rsquo;
1723, that all substances consist of an imponderable fiery substance
called &lsquo;phlogiston&rsquo; (materia aut principium ignis non ipse ignis), and of
another element having particular properties for each substance. The
greater the capacity of a body for oxidation, or the more combustible
it is, the richer it is in phlogiston. Carbon contains it in great
abundance. In oxidation or combustion phlogiston is emitted, and in
reduction it is consumed or enters into combination. Carbon reduces
earthy substances because it is rich in phlogiston, and gives up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
portion of its phlogiston to the substance reduced. Thus Stahl supposed
metals to be compound substances consisting of phlogiston and an
earthy substance or oxide. This hypothesis is distinguished for its
very great simplicity, and for this and other reasons it acquired many
supporters.<a name="FNanchor_24_33" id="FNanchor_24_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_33" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Lavoisier's apparatus for determining the composition of air and the reason
of metals increasing in weight when they are calcined in air.</p></div>

<p>Lavoisier proved by means of the balance that every case of rusting
of metals or oxidation, or of combustion, is accompanied by an increase
in weight at the expense of the atmosphere. He formed, therefore,
the natural opinion that the heavier substance is more complex than
the lighter one.<a name="FNanchor_25_34" id="FNanchor_25_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_34" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Lavoisier's celebrated experiment, made in 1774,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
gave indubitable support to his opinion, which in many respects was
contradictory to Stahl's doctrine. Lavoisier poured four ounces of pure
mercury into a glass retort (fig. <a href="#fig_3">3</a>), whose neck was bent as shown in
the drawing and dipped into the vessel <span class="smcap">R S</span>, also full of mercury. The
projecting end of the neck was covered with a glass bell-jar <span class="smcap">P</span>. The
weight of all the mercury taken, and the volume of air remaining in
the apparatus, namely, that in the upper portion of the retort, and
under the bell-jar, were determined before beginning the experiment.
It was most important in this experiment to know the volume of air
in order to learn what part it played in the oxidation of the mercury,
because, according to Stahl, phlogiston is emitted into the air, whilst,
according to Lavoisier, the mercury in oxidising absorbs a portion of
the air; and consequently it was absolutely necessary to determine
whether the amount of air increased or decreased in the oxidation of
the metal. It was, therefore, most important to measure the volume
of the air in the apparatus both before and after the experiment. For
this purpose it was necessary to know the total capacity of the retort,
the volume of the mercury poured into it, the volume of the bell-jar
above the level of the mercury, and also the temperature and pressure
of the air at the time of its measurement. The volume of air contained
in the apparatus and isolated from the surrounding atmosphere
could be determined from these data. Having arranged his apparatus
in this manner, Lavoisier heated the retort holding the mercury for a
period of twelve days at a temperature near the boiling point of
mercury. The mercury became covered with a quantity of small red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
scales; that is, it was oxidised or converted into an earth. This
substance is the same mercury oxide which has already been mentioned
(example 3). After the lapse of twelve days the apparatus was cooled,
and it was then seen that the volume of the air in the apparatus had
diminished during the time of the experiment. This result was in
exact contradiction to Stahl's hypothesis. Out of 50 cubic inches of
air originally taken, there only remained 42. Lavoisier's experiment led
to other equally important results. The weight of the air taken decreased
by as much as the weight of the mercury increased in oxidising; that is,
the portion of the air was not destroyed, but only combined with mercury.
This portion of the air may be again separated from the mercury oxide
and has, as we saw (example 3), properties different from those of air.
It is called &lsquo;oxygen.&rsquo; That portion of the air which remained in the
apparatus and did not combine with the mercury does not oxidise
metals, and cannot support either combustion or respiration, so that
a lighted taper is immediately extinguished if it be dipped into the
gas which remains in the bell-jar. &lsquo;It is extinguished in the residual
gas as if it had been plunged into water,&rsquo; writes Lavoisier in his
memoirs. This gas is called &lsquo;nitrogen.&rsquo; Thus air is not a simple
substance, but consists of two gases, oxygen and nitrogen, and therefore
the opinion that air is an elementary substance is erroneous. The
oxygen of the air is absorbed in combustion and the oxidation of
metals, and the earths produced by the oxidation of metals are
substances composed of oxygen and a metal. By mixing the oxygen
with the nitrogen the same air as was originally taken is re-formed.
It has also been shown by direct experiment that on reducing an
oxide with carbon, the oxygen contained in the oxide is transferred to
the carbon, and gives the same gas that is obtained by the combustion
of carbon in air. Therefore this gas is a compound of carbon
and oxygen, just as the earthy oxides are composed of metals and
oxygen.</p>

<p>The many examples of the formation and decomposition of substances
which are met with convince us that the majority of substances
with which we have to deal are compounds made up of several other
substances. By heating chalk (or else copper carbonate, as in the
second example) we obtain lime and the same carbonic acid gas which
is produced by the combustion of carbon. On bringing lime into
contact with this gas and water, at the ordinary temperature, we again
obtain the compound, carbonate of lime, or chalk. Therefore chalk is
a compound. So also are those substances from which it may be built
up. Carbonic anhydride is formed by the combination of carbon and
oxygen; and lime is produced by the oxidation of a certain metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
called &lsquo;calcium.&rsquo; By resolving substances in this manner into their
component parts, we arrive at last at such as are indivisible into two
or more substances by any means whatever, and which cannot be formed
from other substances. All we can do is to make such substances combine
together to act on other substances. Substances which cannot be
formed from or decomposed into others are termed <i>simple substances</i>
(elements). Thus all homogeneous substances may be classified into
simple and compound substances. This view was introduced and
established as a scientific fact during the lifetime of Lavoisier. The
number of these elements is very small in comparison with the number
of compound substances which are formed by them. At the present
time, only seventy elements are known with certainty to exist. Some
of them are very rarely met with in nature, or are found in very small
quantities, whilst the existence of others is still doubtful. The number
of elements with whose compounds we commonly deal in everyday life
is very small. Elements cannot be transmuted into one another&mdash;at
least up to the present not a single case of such a transformation has
been met with; it may therefore be said that, as yet, it is impossible
to transmute one metal into another. And as yet, notwithstanding
the number of attempts which have been made in this direction, no
fact has been discovered which could in any way support the idea of
the complexity of such well-known elements<a name="FNanchor_26_35" id="FNanchor_26_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_35" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> as oxygen, iron, sulphur,
&amp;c. Therefore, from its very conception, an element is not susceptible
to reactions of decomposition.<a name="FNanchor_27_36" id="FNanchor_27_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_36" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The quantity, therefore, of each element remains constant in all
chemical changes: a fact which may be deduced as a consequence of
the law of the indestructibility of matter, and of the conception of
elements themselves. Thus the equation expressing the law of the
indestructibility of matter acquires a new and still more important
signification. If we know the quantities of the elements which occur
in the re-acting substances, and if from these substances there proceed,
by means of chemical changes, a series of new compound substances,
then the latter will together contain the same quantity of each of
the elements as there originally existed in the re-acting substances.
The essence of chemical change is embraced in the study of how,
and with what substances, each element is combined before and after
change.</p>

<p>In order to be able to express various chemical changes by equations,
it has been agreed to represent each element by the first or some two
letters of its (Latin) name. Thus, for example, oxygen is represented by
the letter O; nitrogen by N; mercury (hydrargyrum) by Hg; iron
(ferrum) by Fe; and so on for all the elements, as is seen in the tables
on page <a href="#Page_24">24</a>. A compound substance is represented by placing the
symbols representing the elements of which it is made up side by side.
For example, red mercury oxide is represented by HgO, which shows
that it is composed of oxygen and mercury. Besides this, the symbol
of every element corresponds with a certain relative quantity of it by
weight, called its &lsquo;combining&rsquo; weight, or the weight of an atom; so that
the chemical formula of a compound substance not only designates the
nature of the elements of which it is composed, but also their quantitative
proportion. Every chemical process may be expressed by an
equation composed of the formulæ corresponding with those substances
which take part in it and are produced by it. The amount by weight
of the elements in every chemical equation must be equal on both sides
of the equation, since no element is either formed or destroyed in a
chemical change.</p>

<p>On pages <a href="#Page_24">24</a>, <a href="#Page_25">25</a>, and <a href="#Page_26">26</a> a list of the elements, with their symbols
and combining or atomic weights, is given, and we shall see afterwards
on what basis the atomic weights of elements are determined. At
present we will only point out that a compound containing the elements
A and B is designated by the formula A<i>n</i> B<i>m</i>, where <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are the
coefficients or multiples in which the combining weights of the
elements enter into the composition of the substance. If we represent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the combining weight of the substance A by <i>a</i> and that of the
substance B by <i>b</i>, then the composition of the substance A<i>n</i> B<i>m</i> will
be expressed thus: it contains <i>na</i> parts by weight of the substance A
and <i>mb</i> parts by weight of the substance B, and consequently 100 parts
of our compound contain

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>na</i> 100</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>na</i> + <i>mb</i></span>
</span>

percentage parts by weight of the
substance A and

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>mb</i> 100</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>na</i> + <i>mb</i></span>
</span>

of the substance B. It is evident that as
a formula shows the relative amounts of all the elements contained
in a compound, the actual weights of the elements contained in a given
weight of a compound may be calculated from its formula. For example,
the formula NaCl of table salt shows (as Na = 23 and Cl = 35·5)
that 58·5 lbs. of salt contain 23 lbs. of sodium and 35·5 lbs. of chlorine,
and that 100 parts of it contain 39·3 per cent. of sodium and 60·7 per
cent. of chlorine.</p>

<p>What has been said above clearly limits the province of chemical
changes, because from substances of a given kind there can be obtained
only such as contain the same elements. Even with this limitation,
however, the number of possible combinations is infinitely great. Only
a comparatively small number of compounds have yet been described
or subjected to research, and any one working in this direction may
easily discover new compounds which had not before been obtained.
It often happens, however, that such newly-discovered compounds
were foreseen by chemistry, whose object is the apprehension of that
uniformity which rules over the multitude of compound substances,
and whose aim is the comprehension of those laws which govern their
formation and properties. The conception of elements having been
established, the next objects of chemistry were: the determination of
the properties of compound substances on the basis of the determination
of the quantity and kind of elements of which they are composed; the
investigation of the elements themselves; the determination of what
compound substances can be formed from each element and the
properties which these compounds show; and the apprehension of the
nature of the connection between the elements in different compounds.
An element thus serves as the starting point, and is taken as the
primary conception on which all other substances are built up.</p>

<p>When we state that a certain element enters into the composition
of a given compound (when we say, for instance, that mercury oxide
contains oxygen) we do not mean that it contains oxygen as a gaseous
substance, but only desire to express those transformations which
mercury oxide is capable of making; that is, we wish to say that it is
possible to obtain oxygen from mercury oxide, and that it can give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
up oxygen to various other substances; in a word, we desire only to
express those transformations of which mercury oxide is capable. Or,
more concisely, it may be said that the <i>composition</i> of a compound is
the expression of those transformations of which it is capable. It is
useful in this sense to make a clear distinction between the conception
of an element as a <i>separate</i> homogeneous substance, and as a <i>material</i>
but invisible <i>part</i> of a compound. Mercury oxide does not contain
two simple bodies, a gas and a metal, but two elements, mercury and
oxygen, which, when free, are a gas and a metal. Neither mercury as
a metal nor oxygen as a gas is contained in mercury oxide; it only
contains the substance of these elements, just as steam only contains
the substance of ice, but not ice itself, or as corn contains the substance
of the seed, but not the seed itself. The existence of an element may
be recognised without knowing it in the uncombined state, but only
from an investigation of its combinations, and from the knowledge that
it gives, under all possible conditions, substances which are unlike
other known combinations of substances. Fluorine is an example of
this kind. It was for a long time unknown in a free state, and
nevertheless was recognised as an element because its combinations
with other elements were known, and their difference from all other
similar compound substances was determined. In order to grasp the
difference between the conception of the visible form of an element as
we know it in the free state, and of the intrinsic element (or &lsquo;radicle,&rsquo;
as Lavoisier called it) contained in the visible form, it should be
remarked that compound substances also combine together forming yet
more complex compounds, and that they evolve heat in the process of
combination. The original compound may often be extracted from
these new compounds by exactly the same methods as elements are
extracted from their corresponding combinations. Besides, many
elements exist under various visible forms whilst the intrinsic element
contained in these various forms is something which is not subject to
change. Thus carbon appears as charcoal, graphite, and diamond, but
yet the element carbon alone, contained in each, is one and the same.
Carbonic anhydride contains carbon, and not charcoal, or graphite, or
the diamond.</p>

<p>Elements alone, although not all of them, have the peculiar lustre,
opacity, malleability, and the great heat and electrical conductivity
which are proper to metals and their mutual combinations. But
elements are far from all being <i>metals</i>. Those which do not possess
the physical properties of metals are called <i>non-metals</i> (or <i>metalloids</i>).
It is, however, impossible to draw a strict line of demarcation between
metals and non-metals, there being many intermediary substances.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Thus graphite, from which pencils are manufactured, is an element
with the lustre and other properties of a metal; but charcoal and the
diamond, which are composed of the same substance as graphite, do
not show any metallic properties. Both classes of elements are clearly
distinguished in definite examples, but in particular cases the distinction
is not clear and cannot serve as a basis for the exact division of
the elements into two groups.</p>

<p>The conception of elements forms the basis of chemical knowledge,
and in giving a list of them at the very beginning of our work, we
wish to tabulate our present knowledge on the subject. Altogether
about seventy elements are now authentically known, but many of
them are so rarely met with in nature, and have been obtained in such
small quantities, that we possess but a very insufficient knowledge of
them. The substances most widely distributed in nature contain a
very small number of elements. These elements have been more
completely studied than the others, because a greater number of
investigators have been able to carry on experiments and observations
on them. The elements most widely distributed in nature are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Besides these 66 elements there have been discovered:&mdash;Erbium,
Terbium, Samarium, Thullium, Holmium, Mosandrium, Phillipium,
and several others. But their properties and combinations, owing to
their extreme rarity, are very little known, and even their existence as
independent substances<a name="FNanchor_28_37" id="FNanchor_28_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_37" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> is doubtful.</p>

<p>It has been incontestably proved from observations on the spectra
of the heavenly bodies that many of the commoner elements (such as
H, Na, Mg, Fe) occur on the far distant stars. This fact confirms the
belief that those forms of matter which appear on the earth as elements
are widely distributed over the entire universe. But we do not yet
know why, in nature, the mass of some elements should be greater
than that of others.<a name="FNanchor_28_BIS_38" id="FNanchor_28_BIS_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_BIS_38" class="fnanchor">[28 bis]</a></p>

<p>The capacity of each element to combine with one or another
element, and to form compounds with them which are in a greater or
less degree prone to give new and yet more complex substances, forms
the fundamental character of each element. Thus sulphur easily combines
with the metals, oxygen, chlorine, or carbon, whilst gold and
silver enter into combinations with difficulty, and form unstable compounds,
which are easily decomposed by heat. The cause or force
which induces the elements to enter into chemical change must be considered,
as also the cause which holds different substances in combination&mdash;that
is, which endues the substances formed with their particular
degree of stability. This cause or force is called <i>affinity</i> (<i>affinitas</i>,
<i>affinité</i>, <i>Verwandtschaft</i>), or chemical affinity.<a name="FNanchor_29_39" id="FNanchor_29_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_39" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> Since this force must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
be regarded as exclusively an attractive force, like gravity, many
writers (for instance, Bergmann at the end of the last, and Berthollet
at the beginning of this, century) supposed affinity to be essentially
similar to the universal force of gravity, from which it only differs in
that the latter acts at observable distances whilst affinity only evinces
itself at the smallest possible distances. But chemical affinity cannot
be entirely identified with the universal attraction of gravity, which
acts at appreciable distances and is dependent only on mass and distance,
and not on the quality of the material on which it acts, whilst
it is by the quality of matter that affinity is most forcibly influenced.
Neither can it be entirely identified with cohesion, which gives to
homogeneous solid substances their crystalline form, elasticity, hardness,
ductility, and other properties, and to liquids their surface tension,
drop formation, capillarity, and other properties, because affinity acts
between the component parts of a substance and cohesion on a substance
in its homogeneity, although both act at imperceptible distances
(by contact) and have much in common. Chemical force, which makes
one substance penetrate into another, cannot be entirely identified with
even those attracting forces which make different substances adhere to
each other, or hold together (as when two plane-polished surfaces of
solid substances are brought into close contact), or which cause liquids
to soak into solids, or adhere to their surfaces, or gases and vapours to
condense on the surfaces of solids. These forces must not be confounded
with chemical forces, which cause one substance to penetrate
into the substance of another and to form a new substance, which is
never the case with cohesion. But it is evident that the forces which
determine cohesion form a connecting-link between mechanical and
chemical forces, because they only act by intimate contact. For a
long time, and especially during the first half of this century, chemical
attraction and chemical forces were identified with electrical forces.
There is certainly an intimate relation between them, for electricity is
evolved in chemical reactions, and has also a powerful influence on
chemical processes&mdash;for instance, compounds are decomposed by the
action of an electrical current. And the exactly similar relation which
exists between chemical phenomena and the phenomena of heat (heat
being developed by chemical phenomena, and heat being able to decompose
compounds) only proves the unity of the forces of nature, the
capability of one force to produce and to be transformed into others.
For this reason the identification of chemical force with electricity will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
not bear experimental proof.<a name="FNanchor_30_40" id="FNanchor_30_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_40" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> As of all the (molecular) phenomena
of nature which act on substances at immeasurably small distances,
the phenomena of heat are at present the best (comparatively) known,
having been reduced to the simplest fundamental principles of
mechanics (of energy, equilibrium, and movement), which, since
Newton, have been subjected to strict mathematical analysis, it is
quite natural that an effort, which has been particularly pronounced
during recent years, should have been made to bring chemical
phenomena into strict correlation with the already investigated phenomena
of heat, without, however, aiming at any identification of
chemical with heat phenomena. The true nature of chemical force is
still a secret to us, just as is the nature of the universal force of gravity,
and yet without knowing what gravity really is, by applying mechanical
conceptions, astronomical phenomena have been subjected not only
to exact generalisation but to the detailed prediction of a number of
particular facts; and so, also, although the true nature of chemical
affinity may be unknown, there is reason to hope for considerable progress
in chemical science by applying the laws of mechanics to chemical
phenomena by means of the mechanical theory of heat. As yet this
portion of chemistry has been but little worked at, and therefore, while
forming a current problem of the science, it is treated more fully in
that particular field which is termed either &lsquo;theoretical&rsquo; or &lsquo;physical&rsquo;
chemistry, or, more correctly, <i>chemical mechanics</i>. As this province of
chemistry requires a knowledge not only of the various homogeneous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
substances which have yet been obtained and of the chemical transformations
which they undergo, but also of the phenomena (of heat and
other kinds) by which these transformations are accompanied, it is only
possible to enter on the study of chemical mechanics after an acquaintance
with the fundamental chemical conceptions and substances which
form the subject of this book.<a name="FNanchor_31_41" id="FNanchor_31_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_41" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>As the chemical changes to which substances are liable proceed
from internal forces proper to these substances, as chemical phenomena
certainly consist of motions of material parts (from the laws of the
indestructibility of matter and of elements), and as the investigation
of mechanical and physical phenomena proves the law of the <i>indestructibility
of forces</i>, or the conservation of energy&mdash;that is, the possibility
of the transformation of one kind of motion into another (of visible
or mechanical into invisible or physical)&mdash;we are inevitably obliged to
acknowledge the presence in substances (and especially in the elements
of which all others are composed) of a store of <i>chemical energy</i> or invisible
motion inducing them to enter into combinations. If heat
be evolved in a reaction, it means that a portion of chemical energy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
transformed into heat;<a name="FNanchor_32_42" id="FNanchor_32_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_42" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> if heat be absorbed in a reaction,<a name="FNanchor_33_43" id="FNanchor_33_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_43" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> that it is
partly transformed (rendered latent) into chemical energy. The store
of force or energy going to the formation of new compounds may, after
several combinations, accomplished with an absorption of heat, at last
diminish to such a degree that indifferent compounds will be obtained,
although these sometimes, by combining with energetic elements or
compounds, give more complex compounds, which may be capable of
entering into chemical combination. Among elements, gold, platinum,
and nitrogen have but little energy, whilst potassium, oxygen, and
chlorine have a very marked degree of energy. When dissimilar substances
enter into combination they often form substances of diminished
energy. Thus sulphur and potassium when heated easily burn in air,
but when combined together their compound is neither inflammable
nor burns in air like its component parts. Part of the energy of the
potassium and of the sulphur was evolved in their combination in the
form of heat. Just as in the passage of substances from one physical
state into another a portion of their store of heat is absorbed or
evolved, so in combinations or decompositions and in every chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
process, there occurs a change in the store of chemical energy, and at
the same time an evolution or absorption of heat.<a name="FNanchor_34_44" id="FNanchor_34_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_44" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>For the comprehension of chemical phenomena as mechanical processes&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
the study of the <i>modus operandi</i> of chemical phenomena&mdash;it
is most important to consider: (1) the facts gathered from
stoïchiometry, or that part of chemistry which treats of the quantitative
relation, by weight or volume, of the reacting substances; (2) the
distinction between the different forms and classes of chemical
reactions; (3) the study of the changes in properties produced by
alteration in composition; (4) the study of the phenomena which accompany
chemical transformation; (5) a generalisation of the conditions
under which reactions occur. As regards stoïchiometry, this
branch of chemistry has been worked out most thoroughly, and
comprises laws (of Dalton, Avogadro-Gerhardt, and others) which bear
so deeply on all parts of chemistry that at the present time the chief
problem of chemical research consists in the application of general
stoïchiometrical laws to concrete examples, <i>i.e.</i>, the quantitative
(volumetric or gravimetric) composition of substances. All other
branches of chemistry are clearly subordinate to this most important
portion of chemical knowledge. Even the very signification of reactions
of combination, decomposition, and rearrangement, acquired, as
we shall see, a particular and new character under the influence of the
progress of exact ideas concerning the quantitative relations of substances
entering into chemical changes. Furthermore, in this sense
there arose a new&mdash;and, till then, unknown&mdash;division of compound
substances into <i>definite</i> and <i>indefinite</i> compounds. Even at the beginning
of this century, Berthollet had not made this distinction. But Prout
showed that a number of compounds contain the substances of which
they are composed and into which they break up, in exact definite proportions
by weight, which are unalterable under any conditions. Thus,
for example, red mercury oxide always contains sixteen parts by weight
of oxygen for every 200 parts by weight of mercury, which is expressed
by the formula HgO. But in an alloy of copper and silver one or the
other metal may be added at will, and in an aqueous solution of sugar,
the relative proportion of the sugar and water may be altered and
nevertheless a homogeneous whole with the sum of the independent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
properties will be obtained&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, in these cases there was indefinite
chemical combination. Although in nature and chemical practice the
formation of indefinite compounds (such as alloys and solutions) plays
as essential a part as the formation of definite chemical compounds, yet,
as the stoïchiometrical laws at present apply chiefly to the latter, all
facts concerning indefinite compounds suffer from inexactitude, and it
is only during recent years that the attention of chemists has been
directed to this province of chemistry.</p>

<p>In chemical mechanics it is, from a qualitative point of view, very
important to clearly distinguish at the very beginning between <i>reversible</i>
and <i>non-reversible reactions</i>. Substances capable of reacting on
each other at a certain temperature produce substances which at the
same temperature either can or cannot give back the original substances.
For example, salt dissolves in water at the ordinary temperature, and
the solution so obtained is capable of breaking up at the same temperature,
leaving salt and separating the water by evaporation. Carbon
bisulphide is formed from sulphur and carbon at about the same
temperature at which it can be resolved into sulphur and carbon. Iron,
at a certain temperature, separates hydrogen from water, forming iron
oxide, which, in contact with hydrogen at the same temperature, is able
to produce iron and water. It is evident that if two substances, A
and B, give two others C and D, and the reaction be reversible, then
C and D will form A and B, and, consequently, by taking a definite
mass of A and B, or a corresponding mass of C and D, we shall obtain,
in each case, all four substances&mdash;that is to say, there will be a state
of <i>chemical equilibrium</i> between the reacting substances. By increasing
the mass of one of the substances we obtain a new condition of equilibrium,
so that reversible reactions present a means of studying the
<i>influence of mass</i> on the <i>modus operandi</i> of chemical changes. Many
of those reactions which occur with very complicated compounds or
mixtures may serve as examples of non-reversible reactions. Thus
many of the compound substances of animal and vegetable organisms
are broken up by heat, but cannot be re-formed from their products
of decomposition at any temperature. Gunpowder, as a mixture of
sulphur, nitre, and carbon, on being exploded, forms gases from which
the original substances cannot be re-formed at any temperature. In
order to obtain them, recourse must be had to an indirect method <i>of
combination at the moment of separation</i>. If A does not under any
circumstances combine directly with B, it does not follow that it cannot
give a compound A B. For A can often combine with C and B with
D, and if C has a great affinity for D, then the reaction of A C or B D
produces not only C D, but also A B. As on the formation of C D,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
the substances A and B (previously in A C and B D) are left in a
peculiar state of separation, it is supposed that their mutual combination
occurs because they meet together in this <i>nascent state</i> at the
moment of separation (<i>in statu nascendi</i>). Thus chlorine does not
directly combine with charcoal, graphite, or diamond; there are, nevertheless,
compounds of chlorine with carbon, and many of them are
distinguished by their stability. They are obtained in the action of
chlorine on hydrocarbons, as the separation products from the direct
action of chlorine on hydrogen. Chlorine takes up the hydrogen, and
the carbon liberated at the moment of its separation, enters into combination
with another portion of the chlorine, so that in the end the
chlorine is combined with both the hydrogen and the carbon.<a name="FNanchor_35_45" id="FNanchor_35_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_45" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>As regards those phenomena which accompany chemical action, the
most important circumstance in reference to chemical mechanics is that
not only do chemical processes produce a mechanical displacement (a
motion of particles), heat, light, electrical potential and current; but
that all these agents are themselves capable of changing and governing
chemical transformations. This reciprocity or reversibility naturally
depends on the fact that all the phenomena of nature are only different
kinds and forms of visible and invisible (molecular) motions. First
sound, and then light, was shown to consist of vibratory motions, as
the laws of physics have proved and developed beyond a doubt.
The connection between heat and mechanical motion and work has
ceased to be a supposition, but has become an accepted fact, and the
mechanical equivalent of heat (425 kilogrammetres of mechanical work
correspond with one kilogram unit of heat or Calorie) gives a mechanical
measure for thermal phenomena. Although the mechanical
theory of electrical phenomena cannot be considered so fully developed
as the theory of heat, both statical and dynamical electricity are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
produced by mechanical means (in common electrical machines or in
Gramme or other dynamos), and conversely, a current (in electric
motors) can produce mechanical motion. Thus by connecting a current
with the poles of a Gramme dynamo it may be made to revolve, and,
conversely, by rotating it an electrical current is produced, which
demonstrates the reversibility of electricity into mechanical motion.
Accordingly chemical mechanics must look for the fundamental lines
of its advancement in the correlation of chemical with physical and
mechanical phenomena. But this subject, owing to its complexity and
comparative novelty, has not yet been expressed by a harmonious
theory, or even by a satisfactory hypothesis, and therefore we shall
avoid lingering over it.</p>

<p>A chemical change in a certain direction is accomplished not only
by reason of the difference of masses, the composition of the substances
concerned, the distribution of their parts, and their affinity or chemical
energy, but also by reason of the <i>conditions</i> under which the substances
occur. In order that a certain chemical reaction may take
place between substances which are capable of reacting on each other,
it is often necessary to have recourse to conditions which are sometimes
very different from those in which the substances usually occur in
nature. For example, not only is the presence of air (oxygen) necessary
for the combustion of charcoal, but the latter must also be heated to
redness. The red-hot portion of the charcoal burns&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> combines
with the oxygen of the atmosphere&mdash;and in so doing evolves heat,
which raises the temperature of the adjacent parts of charcoal, so
that they burn. Just as the combustion of charcoal is dependent on
its being heated to redness, so also every chemical reaction only takes
place under certain physical, mechanical, or other conditions. The
following are the chief conditions which exert an influence on the
progress of chemical reactions.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Temperature.</i>&mdash;Chemical reactions of combination only take
place within certain definite limits of temperature, and cannot be
accomplished outside these limits. We may cite as examples not only
that the combustion of charcoal begins at a red heat, but also that
chlorine and salt only combine with water at a temperature below 0°.
These compounds cannot be formed at a higher temperature, for they
are then wholly or partially broken up into their component parts.
A certain rise in temperature is necessary to start combustion. In
certain cases the effect of this rise may be explained as causing one
of the reacting bodies to change from a solid into a liquid or gaseous
form. The transference into a fluid form facilitates the progress of
the reaction, because it aids the intimate contact of the particles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
reacting on each other. Another reason, and to this must be ascribed
the chief influence of heat in exciting chemical action, is that the
physical cohesion, or the internal chemical union, of homogeneous
particles is thereby weakened, and in this way the separation of the
particles of the original substances, and their transference into new
compounds, is rendered easier. When a reaction absorbs heat&mdash;as in
decomposition&mdash;the reason why heat is necessary is self-evident.</p>

<p>At the present day it may be asserted upon the basis of existing
data, respecting the action of high temperature, that all compound
bodies are decomposed at a more or less high temperature. We have
already seen examples of this in describing the decomposition of
mercury oxide into mercury and oxygen, and the decomposition of
wood under the influence of heat. Many substances are decomposed
at a very moderate temperature; for instance, the fulminating salt
which is employed in cartridges is decomposed at a little above 120°.
The majority of those compounds which make up the mass of animal
and vegetable tissues are decomposed at 200°. On the other hand,
there is reason to think that at a very low temperature no reaction
whatever can take place. Thus plants cease to carry on their chemical
processes during the winter. Raoul Pictet (1892), employing the very
low temperatures (as low as -200°C.) obtained by the evaporation of
liquefied gases (<i>see</i> Chap. <a href="#Page_113">II.</a>), has recently again proved that at temperatures
below -120°, even such reactions as those between sulphuric acid
and caustic soda or metallic sodium do not take place, and even the
coloration of litmus by acids only commences at temperatures above
-80°. If a given reaction does not take place at a certain low temperature,
it will at first only proceed slowly with a rise of temperature (even
if aided by an electric discharge), and will only proceed rapidly, with
the evolution of heat, when a certain definite temperature has been
reached. Every chemical reaction requires certain limits of temperature
for its accomplishment, and, doubtless, many of the chemical
changes observed by us cannot take place in the sun, where the
temperature is very high, or on the moon, where it is very low.</p>

<p>The influence of heat on reversible reactions is particularly instructive.
If, for instance, a compound which is capable of being reproduced
from its products of decomposition be heated up to the temperature at
which decomposition begins, the decomposition of a mass of the substance
contained in a definite volume is not immediately completed.
Only a certain fraction of the substance is decomposed, the other portion
remaining unchanged, and if the temperature be raised, the quantity
of the substance decomposed increases; furthermore, for a given
volume, the ratio between the part decomposed and the part unaltered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
corresponds with each definite rise in temperature until it reaches that
at which the compound is entirely decomposed. This partial decomposition
under the influence of heat is called <i>dissociation</i>. It is possible
to distinguish between the temperatures at which dissociation
begins and ends. Should dissociation proceed at a certain temperature,
yet should the product or products of decomposition not remain in
contact with the still undecomposed portion of the compound, then
decomposition will go on to the end. Thus limestone is decomposed
in a limekiln into lime and carbonic anhydride, because the latter is
carried off by the draught of the furnace. But if a certain mass of
limestone be enclosed in a definite volume&mdash;for instance, in a gun
barrel&mdash;which is then sealed up, and heated to redness, then, as the
carbonic anhydride cannot escape, a certain proportion only of the
limestone will be decomposed for every increment of heat (rise in temperature)
higher than that at which dissociation begins. Decomposition
will cease when the carbonic anhydride evolved presents a maximum
<i>dissociation pressure</i> corresponding with each rise in temperature. If
the pressure be increased by increasing the quantity of gas, then combination
begins afresh; if the pressure be diminished decomposition
will recommence. Decomposition in this case is exactly similar to
evaporation; if the steam given off by evaporation cannot escape, its
pressure will reach a maximum corresponding with the given temperature,
and then evaporation will cease. Should steam be added it will
be condensed in the liquid; if its quantity be diminished&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> if the
pressure be lessened, the temperature being constant&mdash;then evaporation
will go on. We shall afterwards discuss more fully these phenomena of
dissociation, which were first discovered by Henri St. Claire Deville.
We will only remark that the products of decomposition re-combine
with greater facility the nearer their temperature is to that at which
dissociation begins, or, in other words, that the initial temperature of
dissociation is near to the initial temperature of combination.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>The influence of an electric current</i>, and of electricity in general,
on the progress of chemical transformations is very similar to the
influence of heat. The majority of compounds which conduct electricity
are decomposed by the action of a galvanic current, and as
there is great similarity in the conditions under which decomposition
and combination proceed, combination often proceeds under the influence
of electricity. Electricity, like heat, must be regarded as a
peculiar form of molecular motion, and all that refers to the influence of
heat also refers to the phenomena produced by the action of an
electrical current, with this difference, only that a substance can be
separated into its component parts with much greater ease by electricity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
since the process goes on at the ordinary temperature. The most
stable compounds may be decomposed by this means, and a most important
fact is then observed&mdash;namely, that the component parts
appear at the different poles of electrodes by which the current passes
through the substance. Those substances which appear at the positive
pole (anode) are called &lsquo;electro-negative,&rsquo; and those which appear at
the negative pole (cathode, that in connection with the zinc of an
ordinary galvanic battery) are called &lsquo;electro-positive.&rsquo; The majority
of non-metallic elements, such as chlorine, oxygen, &amp;c., and also acids
and substances analogous to them, belong to the first group, whilst the
metals, hydrogen, and analogous products of decomposition appear
at the negative pole. Chemistry is indebted to the decomposition of
compounds by the electric current for many most important discoveries.
Many elements have been discovered by this method, the most important
being potassium and sodium. Lavoisier and the chemists of
his time were not able to decompose the oxygen compounds of these
metals, but Davy showed that they might be decomposed by an
electric current, the metals sodium and potassium appearing at the
negative pole. Now that the dynamo gives the possibility of producing
an electric current by the combustion of fuel, this method of
Sir H. Davy is advantageously employed for obtaining metals, &amp;c. on
a large scale, for instance, sodium from fused caustic soda or chlorine
from solutions of salt.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Certain unstable compounds are also decomposed by <i>the action
of light</i>. Photography is based on this property in certain substances
(for instance, in the salts of silver). The mechanical energy of those
vibrations which determine the phenomena of light is very small, and
therefore only certain, and these generally unstable, compounds can be
decomposed by light&mdash;at least under ordinary circumstances. But
there is one class of chemical phenomena dependent on the action of
light which forms as yet an unsolved problem in chemistry&mdash;these are
the processes accomplished in plants under the influence of light.
Here there take place most unexpected decompositions and combinations,
which are often unattainable by artificial means. For instance,
carbonic anhydride, which is so stable under the influence of heat and
electricity, is decomposed and evolves oxygen in plants under the
influence of light. In other cases, light decomposes unstable compounds,
such as are usually easily decomposed by heat and other
agents. Chlorine combines with hydrogen under the influence of
light, which shows that combination, as well as decomposition, can
be determined by its action, as was likewise the case with heat and
electricity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Mechanical causes</i> exert, like the foregoing agents, an action
both on the process of chemical combination and of decomposition.
Many substances are decomposed by friction or by a blow&mdash;as, for
example, the compound called iodide of nitrogen (which is composed of
iodine, nitrogen, and hydrogen), and silver fulminate. Mechanical
friction causes sulphur to burn at the expense of the oxygen contained
in potassium chlorate. Pressure affects both the physical and chemical
state of the reacting substances, and, together with the temperature,
determines the state of a substance. This is particularly evident when
the substance occurs in an elastic-gaseous form since the volume, and
hence also the number of points of encounter between the reacting
substances is greatly altered by a change of pressure. Thus, under
equal conditions of temperature, hydrogen when compressed acts more
powerfully upon iodine and on the solutions of many salts.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Besides the various conditions which have been enumerated
above, the progress of chemical reactions is accelerated or retarded by
the <i>condition of contact</i> in which the reacting bodies occur. Other
conditions remaining constant, the rate of progress of a chemical reaction
is accelerated by increasing the number of points of contact. It
will be enough to point out the fact that sulphuric acid does not absorb
ethylene under ordinary conditions of contact, but only after continued
shaking, by which means the number of points of contact is
greatly increased. To ensure complete action between solids, it is
necessary to reduce them to very fine powder and to mix them as
thoroughly as possible. M. Spring, the Belgian chemist, has shown
that finely powdered solids which do not react on each other at the
ordinary temperature may do so under an increased pressure. Thus,
under a pressure of 6,000 atmospheres, sulphur combines with many
metals at the ordinary temperature, and mixtures of the powders of
many metals form alloys. It is evident that an increase in the number
of points or surfaces must be regarded as the chief cause producing
reaction, which is doubtless accomplished in solids, as in liquids and
gases, in virtue of an internal motion of the particles, which motion,
although in different degrees and forms, must exist in all the states of
matter. It is very important to direct attention to the fact that the
internal motion or condition of the parts of the particles of matter
must be different on the surface of a substance from what it is inside;
because in the interior of a substance similar particles are acting on
all sides of every particle, whilst at the surface they act on one side
only. Therefore, the condition of a substance at its surfaces of contact
with other substances must be more or less modified by them&mdash;it may
be in a manner similar to that caused by an elevation of temperature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
These considerations throw some light on the action in the large class
of <i>contact reactions</i>; that is, such as appear to proceed from the mere
presence (contact) of certain special substances. Porous or powdery
substances are very prone to act in this way, especially spongy
platinum and charcoal. For example, sulphurous anhydride does not
combine directly with oxygen, but this reaction takes place in the
presence of spongy platinum.<a name="FNanchor_36_46" id="FNanchor_36_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_46" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The above general and introductory chemical conceptions cannot be
thoroughly grasped in their true sense without a knowledge of the
particular facts of chemistry to which we shall now turn our attention.
It was, however, absolutely necessary to become acquainted on the
very threshold with such fundamental principles as the laws of the
indestructibility of matter and of the conservation of energy, since it is
only by their acceptance, and under their direction and influence, that
the examination of particular facts can give practical and fruitful results.</p>

the relation of the object under examination to that which is already known, either
from previous researches, or from experiment, or from the knowledge of the common
surroundings of life&mdash;that is, in determining and expressing the quality of the unknown
by the aid of that which is known; (<i>b</i>) in measuring all that which can be subjected to
measurement, and thereby denoting the quantitative relation of that under investigation
to that already known and its relation to the categories of time, space, temperature,
mass, &amp;c.; (<i>c</i>) in determining the position held by the object under investigation in the
system of known objects guided by both qualitative and quantitative data; (<i>d</i>) in determining,
from the quantities which have been measured, the empirical (visible) dependence
(function, or &lsquo;law,&rsquo; as it is sometimes termed) of variable factors&mdash;for instance, the
dependence of the composition of the substance on its properties, of temperature on
time, of time on locality, &amp;c.; (<i>e</i>) in framing hypotheses or propositions as to the actual
cause and true nature of the relation between that studied (measured or observed) and
that which is known or the categories of time, space, &amp;c.; (<i>f</i>) in verifying the logical
consequences of the hypotheses by experiment; and (<i>g</i>) in advancing a theory which
shall account for the nature of the properties of that studied in its relations with things
already known and with those conditions or categories among which it exists. It is
certain that it is only possible to carry out these investigations when we have taken as
a basis some incontestable fact which is self-evident to our understanding; as, for instance,
number, time, space, motion, or mass. The determination of such primary or fundamental
conceptions, although not excluded from the possibility of investigation, frequently
does not subject itself to our present mode of scientific generalisation. Hence it follows
that in the investigation of anything, there always remains something which is accepted
without investigation, or admitted as a known factor. The axioms of geometry may be
taken as an example. Thus in the science of biology it is necessary to admit the faculty
of organisms for multiplying themselves, as a conception whose meaning is as yet
unknown. In the study of chemistry, too, the notion of elements must be accepted almost
without any further analysis. However, by first investigating that which is visible and
subject to direct observation by the organs of the senses, we may hope that in the first
place hypotheses will be arrived at, and afterwards theories of that which has now to be
placed at the basis of our investigations. The minds of the ancients strove to seize at
once the very fundamental categories of investigation, whilst all the successes of recent
knowledge are based on the above-cited method of investigation without the determination
of &lsquo;the beginning of all beginnings.&rsquo; By following this inductive method, the <i>exact
sciences</i> have already succeeded in becoming accurately acquainted with much of the
invisible world, which directly is imperceptible to the organs of sense (for example, the
molecular motion of all bodies, the composition of the heavenly luminaries, the paths of
their motion, the necessity for the existence of substances which cannot be subjected
to experiment, &amp;c.), and have verified the knowledge thus obtained, and employed it for
increasing the interests of humanity. It may therefore be safely said that <i>the inductive
method of investigation</i> is a more perfect mode of acquiring knowledge than the
deductive method alone (starting from a little of the unknown accepted as incontestable
to arrive at the much which is visible and observable) by which the ancients strove to
embrace the universe. By investigating the universe by an inductive method (endeavouring
from the much which is observable to arrive at a little which may be verified and
is indubitable) the new science refuses to recognise dogma as truth, but through <i>reason</i>,
by a slow and laborious method of investigation, strives for and attains to true deductions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_10" id="Footnote_2_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_10"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> A substance or material is that which occupies space and has weight; that is,
which presents a mass attracted by the earth and by other masses of material, and of
which the <i>objects</i> of nature are composed, and by means of which the motions and
<i>phenomena</i> of nature are accomplished. It is easy to discover by examining and
investigating, by various methods, the objects met with in nature and in the arts, that
some of them are homogeneous, whilst others are composed of a mixture of several
homogeneous substances. This is most clearly apparent in solid substances. The
metals used in the arts (for example, gold, iron, copper) must be homogeneous, otherwise
they are brittle and unfit for many purposes. Homogeneous matter exhibits similar
properties in all its parts. By breaking up a homogeneous substance we obtain parts
which, although different in form, resemble each other in their properties. Glass, pure
sugar, marble, &amp;c., are examples of homogeneous substances. Examples of non-homogeneous
substances are, however, much more frequent in nature and the arts. Thus
the majority of the rocks are not homogeneous. In porphyries bright pieces of a mineral
called &lsquo;orthoclase&rsquo; are often seen interspersed amongst the dark mass of the rock. In
ordinary red granite it is easy to distinguish large pieces of orthoclase mixed with dark
semi-transparent quartz and flexible laminæ of mica. Similarly, plants and animals are
non-homogeneous. Thus, leaves are composed of a skin, fibre, pulp, sap, and a green
colouring matter. As an example of those non-homogeneous substances which are produced
artificially, gunpowder may be cited, which is prepared by mixing together known
proportions of sulphur, nitre, and charcoal. Many liquids, also, are not homogeneous, as
may be observed by the aid of the microscope, when drops of blood are seen to consist of
a colourless liquid in which red corpuscles, invisible to the naked eye owing to their
small size, are floating about. It is these corpuscles which give blood its peculiar colour.
Milk is also a transparent liquid, in which microscopical drops of fat are floating, which
rise to the top when milk is left at rest, forming cream. It is possible to extract from
every non-homogeneous substance those homogeneous substances of which it is made
up. Thus orthoclase may he separated from porphyry by breaking it off. So also gold is
extracted from auriferous sand by washing away the mixture of clay and sand.
Chemistry deals only with the homogeneous substances met with in nature, or extracted
from natural or artificial non-homogeneous substances. The various mixtures found
in nature form the subjects of other natural sciences&mdash;as geognosy, botany, zoology,
anatomy, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_11" id="Footnote_3_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_11"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> All those events which are accomplished by substances in time are termed &lsquo;phenomena.&rsquo;
Phenomena in themselves form the fundamental subject of the study of physics.
Motion is the primary and most generally understood form of phenomenon, and therefore
we endeavour to reason about other phenomena as clearly as when dealing with motion.
For this reason mechanics, which treats of motion, forms the fundamental science of
natural philosophy, and all other sciences endeavour to reduce the phenomena with
which they are concerned to mechanical principles. Astronomy was the first to take
to this path of reasoning, and succeeded in many cases in reducing astronomical to
purely mechanical phenomena. Chemistry and physics, physiology and biology are proceeding
in the same direction. One of the most important questions of all natural science,
and one which has been handed down from the philosophers of classic times, is, whether
the comprehension of all that is visible can be reduced to motion? Its participation in
all, from the &lsquo;fixed&rsquo; stars to the most minute parts of the coldest bodies (Dewar, in 1894
showed that many substances cooled to -180° fluoresce more strongly than at the ordinary
temperature; <i>i.e.</i> that there is a motion in them which produces light) must now be
recognised as undoubtable from direct experiment and observation, but it does not follow
from this that by motion alone can all be explained. This follows, however, from the
fact that we cannot apprehend motion otherwise than by recognising matter in a state
of motion. If light and electricity be understood as particular forms of motion, then we
must inevitably recognise the existence of a peculiar luminiferous (universal) ether as a
material, transmitting this form of motion. And so, under the present state of knowledge,
it is inevitably necessary to recognise the particular categories, motion and matter,
and as chemistry is more closely concerned with the various forms of the latter, it should,
together with mechanics or the study of motion, lie at the basis of natural science.</p></div>

Or else iron filings are mixed with powdered sulphur in the proportion of 5 parts of iron
to 3 parts of sulphur, and the mixture placed in a glass tube, which is then heated in one
place. Combination does not commence without the aid of external heat, but when once
started in any portion of the mixture it extends throughout the entire mass, because
the portion first heated evolves sufficient heat in forming iron sulphide to raise the
adjacent parts of the mixture to the temperature required for starting the reaction. The
rise in temperature thus produced is so high as to soften the glass tube.</p></div>

the substance is heated and vapours are given off which, on cooling, condense into
liquids. In general, decomposition, in absorbing heat, presents much in common to a
physical change of state&mdash;such as, for example, that of a liquid into a gas. Deville
likened complete decomposition to boiling, and compared partial decomposition, when a

only; that is to say, a substance may by itself change into a new isomeric form. Thus,
for example, if hard yellow sulphur be heated to a temperature of 250° and then poured
into cold water it gives, on cooling, a soft, brown variety. Ordinary phosphorus, which
is transparent, poisonous, and phosphorescent in the dark (in the air), gives, after being
heated at 270° (in an atmosphere incapable of supporting combustion, such as steam), an
opaque, red, and non-poisonous isomeric variety, which is not phosphorescent. Cases of
isomerism point out the possibility of an internal rearrangement in a substance, and are
the result of an alteration in the grouping of the same elements, just as a certain number
of balls may be grouped in figures and forms of different shapes.</p></div>

Silver) form some of the accurate researches, proving that the weight of matter is not
altered in chemical reactions, because he accurately weighed (introducing all the necessary
corrections) the reacting and resultant substances. Landolt (1893) carried on
various reactions in inverted and sealed glass U-tubes, and on weighing the tubes before
reaction (when the reacting solutions were separated in each of the branches of the
tubes), and after (when the solutions had been well mixed together by shaking), found
that either the weight remained perfectly constant or that the variation was so small
(for instance, 0·2 milligram in a total weight of about a million milligrams) as to be
ascribed to the inevitable errors of weighing.</p></div>

(died 1642), and more especially by Newton (born 1643, died 1727), in the glorious epoch
of the development of the principles of inductive reasoning enunciated by Bacon and
Descartes in their philosophical treatises. Shortly after the death of Newton, Lavoisier,
whose fame in natural philosophy should rank with that of Galileo and Newton, was born
on August 26, 1743. The death of Lavoisier occurred during the Reign of Terror of the
French Revolution, when he, together with twenty-six other chief farmers of the revenue,
was guillotined on May 8, 1794, at Paris; but his works and ideas have made him

(ordinary filings must be first washed in ether, dried, and passed through a very fine
sieve). The filings thus obtained are capable of burning directly in air (by oxidising or
forming rust), especially when they hang (are attracted) on a magnet. A compact piece
of iron does not burn in air, but spongy iron glows and smoulders like tinder. In making
the experiment, a horse-shoe magnet is fixed, with the poles downwards, on one arm of a
rather sensitive balance, and the iron filings are applied to the magnet (on a sheet of
paper) so as to form a beard about the poles. The balance pan should be exactly under
the filings on the magnet, in order that any which might fall from it should not alter the
weight. The filings, having been weighed, are set light to by applying the flame of a
candle; they easily take fire, and go on burning by themselves, forming rust. When the
combustion is ended, it will be clear that the iron has increased in weight; from 5&frac12; parts

If of small diameter and thickness, a glass tube is easily bent by heating in a gas
jet or the flame of a spirit lamp, and it may also be easily divided at a given point by making
a deep scratch with a file and then breaking the tube at this point with a sharp jerk.
These properties, together with their impermeability, transparency, hardness, and regularity
of bore, render glass tubes most useful in experiments with gases. Naturally they
might be replaced by straws, india-rubber, metallic, or other tubes, but these are more
difficult to fix on to a vessel, and are not entirely impervious to gases. A glass gas
delivery tube may be hermetically fixed into a vessel by fitting it into a perforated cork,
which should be soft and free from flaws, and fixing the cork into the orifice of the
vessel. To protect the cork from the action of gases it is sometimes previously soaked
in paraffin, or it may be replaced by an india-rubber cork.</p></div>

and the difficulty of dealing with them in large masses, they can only be weighed
by very sensitive balances; that is, in such as, with a considerable load, indicate a very
small difference in weight&mdash;for example, a centigram or a milligram with a load of 1,000
grams. In order to weigh a gas, a glass globe furnished with a tight-fitting stop-cock is
first of all exhausted of air by an air-pump (a Sprengel pump is the best). The stop-cock
is then closed, and the exhausted globe weighed. If the gas to be weighed is then
let into the globe, its weight can be determined from the increase in the weight of the
globe. It is necessary, however, that the temperature and pressure of the air about the
balance should remain constant for both weighings, as the weight of the globe in air will
(according to the laws of hydrostatics) vary with its density. The volume of the air displaced,
and its weight, must therefore be determined by observing the temperature,
density, and moisture of the atmosphere during the time of experiment. This will
be partly explained later, but may be studied more in detail by physics. Owing to the
complexity of all these operations, the mass of a gas is usually determined from its
volume and density, or from the weight of a known volume.</p></div>

copper oxide and carbonic anhydride&mdash;water will be obtained in the decomposition.
Water forms a part of the composition of malachite, and has therefore to be taken into
consideration. The water produced in the decomposition may be all collected by absorbing
it in sulphuric acid or calcium chloride, as will be described further on. In order to
dry a salt it must be heated at about 100° until its weight remains constant, or be placed
under an air pump over sulphuric acid, as will also be presently described. As water is
met with almost everywhere, and as it is absorbed by many substances, the possibility
of its presence should never be lost sight of.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_27" id="Footnote_18_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_27"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> As the decomposition of red oxide of mercury requires so high a temperature, near
redness, as to soften ordinary glass, it is necessary for this experiment to take a retort
(or test tube) made of hard glass, which is able to stand high temperatures without
softening. For the same reason, the lamp used must give a strong heat and a large
flame, capable of embracing the whole bottom of the retort, which should be as small as
possible for the convenience of the experiment.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_28" id="Footnote_19_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_28"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The pneumatic trough may naturally be made of any material (china, earthenware,
or metal, &amp;c.), but usually a glass one, as shown in the drawing, is used, as it allows the
progress of the experiment to be better observed. For this reason, as well as the ease
with which they are kept clean, and from the fact also that glass is not acted on by many
substances which affect other materials (for instance, metals), glass vessels of all kinds&mdash;such
as retorts, test tubes, cylinders, beakers, flasks, globes, &amp;c.&mdash;are preferred to any
other for chemical experiments. Glass vessels may be heated without any danger if the
following precautions be observed: 1st, they should be made of thin glass, as otherwise
they are liable to crack from the bad heat-conducting power of glass; 2nd, they should be
surrounded by a liquid or with sand (Fig. <a href="#fig_2">2</a>), or sand bath as it is called; or else should
stand in a current of hot gases without touching the fuel from which they proceed, or in
the flame of a smokeless lamp. A common candle or lamp forms a deposit of soot on a
cold object placed in their flames. The soot interferes with the transmission of heat, and
so a glass vessel when covered with soot often cracks. And for this reason spirit lamps,
which burn with a smokeless flame, or gas burners of a peculiar construction, are used.
In the Bunsen burner the gas is mixed with air, and burns with a non-luminous and
smokeless flame. On the other hand, if an ordinary lamp (petroleum or benzine) does
not smoke it may be used for heating a glass vessel without danger, provided the glass is
placed well above the flame in the current of hot gases. In all cases, the heating should
be begun very carefully by raising the temperature by degrees.</p>

do not repeat themselves in everyday experience under various aspects, but always in one
form, or only at intervals and infrequently, is usually wrong. Thus the daily evidence
of the rising of the sun and stars evokes the erroneous idea that the heavens move and
the earth stands still. This apparent truth is far from being the real truth, and, as a
matter of fact, is contradictory to it. Similarly, an ordinary mind and everyday experience
concludes that iron is incombustible, whereas it burns not only as filings, but even
as wire, as we shall afterwards see. With the progress of knowledge very many primitive
prejudices have been obliged to give way to true ideas which have been verified by
experiment. In ordinary life we often reason at first sight with perfect truth, only
because we are taught a right judgment by our daily experience. It is a necessary
consequence of the nature of our minds to reach the attainment of truth through elementary
and often erroneous reasoning and through experiment, and it would be very
wrong to expect a knowledge of truth from a simple mental effort. Naturally, experiment
itself cannot give truth, but it gives the means of destroying erroneous representations
whilst confirming those which are true in all their consequences.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_33" id="Footnote_24_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_33"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> It is true that Stahl was acquainted with a fact which directly disproved his
hypothesis. It was already known (from the experiments of Geber, and more especially
of Ray, in 1630) that metals increase in weight by oxidation, whilst, according to Stahl's
hypothesis, they should decrease in weight, because phlogiston is separated by oxidation.
Stahl speaks on this point as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;I am well aware that metals, in their transformation
into earths, increase in weight. But not only does this fact not disprove my theory,
but, on the contrary, confirms it, for phlogiston is lighter than air, and, in combining
with substances, strives to lift them, and so decreases their weight; consequently, a
substance which has lost phlogiston must be heavier.&rsquo; This argument, it will be seen, is
founded on a misconception of the properties of gases, regarding them as having no weight
and as not being attracted by the earth, or else on a confused idea of phlogiston itself,
since it was first defined as imponderable. The conception of imponderable phlogiston
tallies well with the habit and methods of the last century, when recourse was often had
to imponderable fluids for explaining a large number of phenomena. Heat, light, magnetism,
and electricity were explained as being peculiar imponderable fluids. In this
sense the doctrine of Stahl corresponds entirely with the spirit of his age. If heat be
now regarded as motion or energy, then phlogiston also should be considered in this
light. In fact, in combustion, of coals for instance, heat and energy are evolved, and
not combined in the coal, although the oxygen and coal do combine. Consequently, the
doctrine of Stahl contains the essence of a true representation of the evolution of energy,
but naturally this evolution is only a consequence of the combination occurring between
the coal and oxygen. As regards the history of chemistry prior to Lavoisier, besides
Stahl's work (to which reference has been made above), Priestley's <i>Experiments and
Observations on Different Kinds of Air</i>, London, 1790, and also Scheele's <i>Opuscula
Chimica et Physica</i>, Lips., 1788&ndash;89, 2 vols., must be recommended as the two leading
works of the English and Scandinavian chemists showing the condition of chemical
learning before the propagation of Lavoisier's views, and containing also many important
observations which lie at the basis of the chemistry of our times. A most interesting
memoir on the history of phlogiston is that of Rodwell, in the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>,
1868, in which it is shown that the idea of phlogiston dates very far back, that Basil
Valentine (1394&ndash;1415), in the <i>Cursus Triumphalis Antimonii</i>, Paracelsus (1493&ndash;1541),
in his work, <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, Glauber (1604&ndash;1668), and especially John Joachim Becher
(1625&ndash;1682), in his <i>Physica Subterranea</i>, all referred to phlogiston, but under different
names.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_34" id="Footnote_25_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_34"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> An Englishman, named Mayow, who lived a whole century before Lavoisier (in
1666), understood certain phenomena of oxidation in their true aspect, but was not able
to develop his views with clearness, or support them by conclusive experiments; he
cannot therefore be considered, like Lavoisier, as the founder of contemporary chemical
learning. Science is a universal heritage, and therefore it is only just to give the highest
honour in science, not to those who first enunciate a certain truth, but to those who are
first able to convince others of its authenticity and establish it for the general welfare.
But scientific discoveries are rarely made all at once; as a rule, the first teachers do not
succeed in convincing others of the truth they have discovered; with time, however, a
true herald comes forward, possessing every means for making the truth apparent to all,
but it must not be forgotten that such are entirely indebted to the labours and mass
of data accumulated by many others. Such was Lavoisier, and such are all the great
founders of science. They are the enunciators of all past and present learning, and their
names will always be revered by posterity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_35" id="Footnote_26_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_35"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Many of the ancient philosophers assumed the existence of one elementary form of
matter. This idea still appears in our times, in the constant efforts which are made to
reduce the number of the elements; to prove, for instance, that bromine contains chlorine
or that chlorine contains oxygen. Many methods, founded both on experiment and
theory, have been tried to prove the compound nature of the elements. All labour in
this direction has as yet been in vain, and the assurance that elementary matter is not
so homogeneous (single) as the mind would desire in its first transport of rapid generalisation
is strengthened from year to year. All our knowledge shows that iron and
other elements remain, even at such a high temperature as there exists in the sun, as
different substances, and are not converted into one common material. Admitting, even
mentally, the possibility of one elementary form of matter, a method must be imagined
by which it could give rise to the various elements, as also the <i>modus operandi</i> of their
formation from one material. If it be said that this diversitude only takes place at low
temperatures, as is observed with isomerides, then there would be reason to expect, if not
the transition of the various elements into one particular and more stable form, at least
the mutual transformation of some into others. But nothing of the kind has as yet been
observed, and the alchemist's hope to manufacture (as Berthollet puts it) elements has no
theoretical or practical foundation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_36" id="Footnote_27_36"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_36"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> The weakest point in the idea of elements is the negative character of the determinative
signs given them by Lavoisier, and from that time ruling in chemistry. They do
<i>not</i> decompose, they do <i>not</i> change into one another. But it must be remarked that
elements form the limiting horizon of our knowledge of matter, and it is always difficult to
determine a positive side on the borderland of what is known. Besides, there is no doubt
(from the results of spectrum analysis) that the elements are distributed as far as the
most distant stars, and that they support the highest attainable temperatures without
decomposing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_37" id="Footnote_28_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_37"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Possibly some of their compounds are compounds of other already-known elements.
Pure and incontestably independent compounds of these substances are unknown, and
some of them have not even been separated, but are only supposed to exist from the
results of spectroscopic researches. There can be no mention of such contestable and
doubtful elements in a short general handbook of chemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_BIS_38" id="Footnote_28_BIS_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_BIS_38"><span class="label">[28 bis]</span></a> Clark in America made an approximate calculation of the amount of the different
elements contained in the earth's crust (to a depth of 15 kilometres), and found
that the chief mass (over 50 per cent.) is composed of oxygen; then comes silicon, &amp;c.;
while the amount of hydrogen is less than 1 per cent., carbon scarcely 0·25 per cent.,
nitrogen even less than 0·03 per cent. The relative masses of such metals as Cu, Ni, Au
is minute. Judging from the density (see Chapter <a href="#Page_338">VIII</a>.) of the earth, a large proportion
of its mass must be composed of iron.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_39" id="Footnote_29_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_39"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> This word, first introduced, if I mistake not, into chemistry by Glauber, is based
on the idea of the ancient philosophers that combination can only take place when the
substances combining have something in common&mdash;a medium. As is generally the case,
another idea evolved itself in antiquity, and has lived until now, side by side with the
first, to which it is exactly contradictory; this considers union as dependent on contrast,
on polar difference, on an effort to fill up a want.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_40" id="Footnote_30_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_40"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Especially conclusive are those cases of so-called metalepsis (Dumas, Laurent).
Chlorine, in combining with hydrogen, forms a very stable substance called &lsquo;hydrochloric
acid,&rsquo; which is split up by the action of an electrical current into chlorine and hydrogen,
the chlorine appearing at the positive and the hydrogen at the negative pole. Hence
electro-chemists considered hydrogen to be an electro-positive and chlorine an electro-negative
element, and that they are held together in virtue of their opposite electrical
charges. It appears, however, from metalepsis, that chlorine can replace hydrogen (and,
inversely, hydrogen can replace chlorine) in its compounds without in any way changing
the grouping of the other elements, or altering their chief chemical properties. For
instance, acetic acid in which hydrogen has been replaced by chlorine is still capable of
forming salts. It must be observed, whilst considering this subject, that the explanation
suggesting electricity as the origin of chemical phenomena is unsound, since it attempts to
explain one class of phenomena whose nature is almost unknown by another class which
is no better known. It is most instructive to remark that together with the electrical
theory of chemical attraction there arose and survives a view which explains the galvanic
current as being a transference of chemical action through the circuit&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, regards the
origin of electricity as being a chemical one. It is evident that the connection is very
intimate, although both phenomena are independent and represent different forms of
molecular (atomic) motion, whose real nature is not yet understood. Nevertheless, the
connection between the phenomena of both categories is not only in itself very instructive,
but it extends the applicability of the general idea of the unity of the forces of nature,
conviction of the truth of which has held so important a place in the science of the last
ten years.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_41" id="Footnote_31_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_41"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> I consider that in an elementary text-book of chemistry, like the present, it is only
possible and advisable to mention, in reference to chemical mechanics, a few general
ideas and some particular examples referring more especially to gases, whose mechanical
theory must be regarded as the most complete. The molecular mechanics of liquids and
solids is as yet in embryo, and contains much that is disputable; for this reason,
chemical mechanics has made less progress in relation to these substances. It may not
be superfluous here to remark, with respect to the conception of chemical affinity, that
up to the present time gravity, electricity, and heat have all been applied to its elucidation.
Efforts have also been made to introduce the luminiferous ether into theoretical
chemistry, and should that connection between the phenomena of light and electricity
which was established by Maxwell be worked out more in detail, doubtless these efforts
to elucidate all or a great deal by the aid of luminiferous ether will again appear in
theoretical chemistry. An independent chemical mechanics of the material particles of
matter, and of their internal (atomic) changes, would, in my opinion, arise as the result
of these efforts. Two hundred years ago Newton laid the foundation of a truly scientific
theoretical mechanics of external visible motion, and on this foundation erected the
edifice of celestial mechanics. One hundred years ago Lavoisier arrived at the first
fundamental law of the internal mechanics of invisible particles of matter. This subject
is far from having been developed into a harmonious whole, because it is much more
difficult, and, although many details have been completely investigated, it does not
possess any starting points. Newton only came after Copernicus and Kepler, who had
discovered empirically the exterior simplicity of celestial phenomena. Lavoisier and
Dalton may, in respect to the chemical mechanics of the molecular world, be compared
to Copernicus and Kepler. But a Newton has not yet appeared in the molecular world;
when he does, I think that he will find the fundamental laws of the mechanics of the
invisible motions of matter more easily and more quickly in the chemical structure of
matter than in physical phenomena (of electricity, heat, and light); for these latter are
accomplished by particles of matter already arranged, whilst it is now clear that the
problem of chemical mechanics mainly lies in the apprehension of those motions which
are invisibly accomplished by the smallest atoms of matter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_42" id="Footnote_32_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_42"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> The theory of heat gave the idea of a store of internal motion or energy, and
therefore with it, it became necessary to acknowledge chemical energy, but there is no
foundation whatever for identifying heat energy with chemical energy. It may be supposed,
but not positively affirmed, that heat motion is proper to molecules and chemical
motion to atoms, but that as molecules are made up of atoms, the motion of the one
passes to the other, and that for this reason heat strongly influences reaction and
appears or disappears (is absorbed) in reactions. These relations, which are apparent
and hardly subject to doubt on general lines, still present much that is doubtful in
detail, because all forms of molecular and atomic motion are able to pass into each
other.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_43" id="Footnote_33_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_43"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The reactions which take place (at the ordinary or at a high temperature) directly
between substances may be clearly divided into exothermal, which are accompanied by
an evolution of heat, and endothermal, which are accompanied by an absorption of heat.
It is evident that the latter require a source of heat. They are determined either by the
directly surrounding medium (as in the formation of carbon bisulphide from charcoal and
sulphur, or in decompositions which take place at high temperatures), or else by a
secondary reaction proceeding simultaneously, or by some other form of energy (light,
electricity). So, for instance, hydrogen sulphide is decomposed by iodine in the presence
of water at the expense of the heat which is evolved by the solution in water of the
hydrogen iodide produced. This is the reason why this reaction, as exothermal, only
takes place in the presence of water; otherwise it would be accompanied by a cooling
effect. As in the combination of dissimilar substances, the bonds existing between the
molecules and atoms of the homogeneous substances have to be broken asunder, whilst in
reactions of rearrangement the formation of any one substance proceeds simultaneously
with the formation of another, and, as in reactions, a series of physical and mechanical
changes take place, it is impossible to separate the heat directly depending on a given
reaction from the total sum of the observed heat effect. For this reason, thermochemical
data are very complex, and cannot by themselves give the key to many chemical problems,
as it was at first supposed they might. They ought to form a part of chemical mechanics,
but alone they do not constitute it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_44" id="Footnote_34_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_44"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> As chemical reactions are effected by heating, so the heat absorbed by substances
before decomposition or change of state, and called &lsquo;specific heat,&rsquo; goes in many cases to
the preparation, if it may be so expressed, of reaction, even when the limit of the
temperature of reaction is not attained. The molecules of a substance A, which is not able
to react on a substance B below a temperature <i>t</i>, by being heated from a somewhat lower
temperature to <i>t</i>, undergoes that change which had to be arrived at for the formation
of A B.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_45" id="Footnote_35_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_45"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> It is possible to imagine that the cause of a great many of such reactions is, that
substances taken in a separate state, for instance, charcoal, present a complex molecule
composed of separate atoms of carbon which are fastened together (united, as is usually
said) by a considerable affinity; for atoms of the same kind, just like atoms of different
kinds, possess a mutual affinity. The affinity of chlorine for carbon, although unable
to break this bond asunder, may be sufficient to form a stable compound with atoms of
carbon, which are already separate. Such a view of the subject presents a hypothesis
which, although dominant at the present time, is without sufficiently firm foundation. It
is evident, however, that not only does chemical reaction itself consist of motions, but
that in the compound formed (in the molecules) the elements (atoms) forming it are in
harmonious stable motion (like the planets in the solar system), and this motion will
affect the stability and capacity for reaction, and therefore the mechanical side of chemical
action must be exceedingly complex. Just as there are solid, physically constant non-volatile
substances like rock, gold, charcoal, &amp;c., so are there stable and chemically constant
bodies; while corresponding to physically volatile substances there are bodies like
camphor, which are chemically unstable and variable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_46" id="Footnote_36_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_46"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Contact phenomena are separately considered in detail in the work of Professor
Konovaloff (1884). In my opinion, it must be held that the state of the internal motions
of the atoms in molecules is modified at the points of contact of substances, and this
state determines chemical reactions, and therefore, that reactions of combination, decomposition,
and rearrangement are accomplished by contact. Professor Konovaloff
showed that a number of substances, under certain conditions of their surfaces, act by
contact; for instance, finely divided silica (from the hydrate) acts just like platinum,
decomposing certain compound ethers. As reactions are only accomplished under close
contact, it is probable that those modifications in the distribution of the atoms in molecules
which come about by contact phenomena prepare the way for them. By this the
<i>rôle</i> of contact phenomena is considerably extended. Such phenomena should explain
the fact why a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen yields water (explodes) at different
temperatures, according to the kind of heated substance which transmits this temperature.
In chemical mechanics, phenomena of this kind have great importance, but as yet
they have been but little studied. It must not be forgotten that contact is a necessary
condition for every chemical reaction.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">ON WATER AND ITS COMPOUNDS</span></h2>

<p>Water is found almost everywhere in nature, and in all three physical
states. As vapour, water occurs in the atmosphere, and in this form
it is distributed over the entire surface of the earth. The vapour of
water in condensing, by cooling, forms snow, rain, hail, dew, and fog.
One cubic metre (or 1,000,000 cubic centimetres, or 1,000 litres, or
35·316 cubic feet) of air can contain at 0° only 4·8 grams of water, at
20° about 17·0 grams, at 40° about 50·7 grams; but ordinary air only
contains about 60 per cent. of this maximum. Air containing less
than 40 per cent. is felt to be dry, whilst air which contains more than
80 per cent. of the same maximum is considered as distinctly damp.<a name="FNanchor_1_47" id="FNanchor_1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_47" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
Water in the liquid state, in falling as rain and snow, soaks into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
soil and collects together into springs, lakes, rivers, seas, and oceans.
It is absorbed from the soil by the roots of plants, which, when fresh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a><br /><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a><br /><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
contain from 40 to 80 per cent. of water by weight. Animals contain
about the same amount of water. In a solid state, water appears
as snow, ice, or in an intermediate form between these two, which
is seen on mountains covered with perpetual snow. The water of
rivers,<a name="FNanchor_2_48" id="FNanchor_2_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_48" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> springs, oceans and seas, lakes, and wells contains various
substances in solution mostly salt,&mdash;that is, substances resembling
common table salt in their physical properties and chief chemical
transformations. Further, the quantity and nature of these salts
differ in different waters.<a name="FNanchor_3_49" id="FNanchor_3_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_49" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Everybody knows that there are salt,

gravity. Fresh water also contains salts, but only in a comparatively
small quantity. Their presence may be easily proved by simply
evaporating water in a vessel. On evaporation the water passes
away as vapour, whilst the salts are left behind. This is why a crust
(incrustation), consisting of salts, previously in solution, is deposited on
the insides of kettles or boilers, and other vessels in which water is
boiled. Running water (rivers, &amp;c.) is charged with salts, owing to its
being formed from the collection of rain water percolating through the
soil. While percolating, the water dissolves certain parts of the soil.
Thus water which filters or passes through saline or calcareous soils
becomes charged with salts or contains calcium carbonate (chalk).
Rain water and snow are much purer than river or spring water.
Nevertheless, in passing through the atmosphere, rain and snow succeed
in catching the dust held in it, and dissolve air, which is found in every
water. The dissolved gases of the atmosphere are partly disengaged,
as bubbles from water on heating, and water after long boiling is quite
freed from them.</p>

<p>In general terms water is called pure when it is clear and free from
insoluble particles held in suspension and visible to the naked eye, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
which it may be freed by filtration through charcoal, sand, or porous
(natural or artificial) stones, and when it possesses a clean fresh taste.
It depends on the absence of any taste, decomposing organic matter,
on the quantity of air<a name="FNanchor_5_51" id="FNanchor_5_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_51" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and atmospheric gases in solution, and on the
presence of mineral substances to the amount of about 300 grams per
ton (or 1000 kilograms per cubic metre, or, what is the same, 300
milligrams to a kilogram or a litre of water), and of not more than
100 grams of organic matter.<a name="FNanchor_6_52" id="FNanchor_6_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_52" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Such water is suitable for drinking and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
every practical application, but evidently it is not pure in a chemical
sense. A <i>chemically pure water</i> is necessary not only for scientific
purposes, as an independent substance having constant and definite
properties, but also for many practical purposes&mdash;for instance, in photography
and in the preparation of medicines&mdash;because many properties
of substances in solution are changed by the impurities of natural
waters. Water is usually purified by distillation, because the solid
substances in solution are not transformed into vapours in this process.
Such <i>distilled</i> water is prepared by chemists and in laboratories by
boiling water in closed metallic boilers or stills, and causing the steam
produced to pass into a condenser&mdash;that is, through tubes (which should
be made of tin, or, at all events, tinned, as water and its impurities
do not act on tin) surrounded by cold water, and in which the steam,
being cooled, condenses into water which is collected<a name="FNanchor_7_53" id="FNanchor_7_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_53" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in a receiver.
By standing exposed to the atmosphere, however, the water in time
absorbs air, and dust carried in the air. Nevertheless, in distillation,
water retains, besides air, a certain quantity of volatile impurities
(especially organic) and the walls of the distillation apparatus are partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
corroded by the water, and a portion, although small, of their substance
renders the water not entirely pure, and a residue is left on evaporation.<a name="FNanchor_8_54" id="FNanchor_8_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_54" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>For certain physical and chemical researches, however, it is necessary
to have perfectly pure water. To obtain it, a solution of potassium
permanganate is added to distilled water until the whole is a light rose
colour. By this means the organic matter in the water is destroyed
(converted into gases or non-volatile substances). An excess of potassium
permanganate does no harm, because in the next distillation it is
left behind in the distillation apparatus. The second distillation should
take place in a platinum retort with a platinum receiver. Platinum is
a metal which is not acted on either by air or water, and therefore
nothing passes from it into the water. The water obtained in the
receiver still contains air. It must then be boiled for a long time, and
afterwards cooled in a vacuum under the receiver of an air pump. Pure
water does not leave any residue on evaporation; does not in the least
change, however long it be kept; does not decompose like water only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
once distilled or impure; and it does not give bubbles of gas on heating,
nor does it change the colour of a solution of potassium permanganate.</p>

<p>Water, purified as above described, has constant <i>physical</i> and
<i>chemical properties</i>. For instance, it is of such water only that one
cubic centimetre weighs one gram at 4° C.&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it is only such pure
water whose specific gravity equals 1 at 4° C.<a name="FNanchor_9_55" id="FNanchor_9_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_55" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Water in a solid state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a><br /><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
forms crystals of the hexagonal system<a name="FNanchor_10_56" id="FNanchor_10_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_56" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> which are seen in snow, which
generally consists of star-like clusters of several crystals, and also in
the half-melted scattered ice floating on rivers in spring time. At
this time of the year the ice splits up into spars or prisms, bounded by
angles proper to substances crystallising in the hexagonal system.</p>

<p>The temperatures at which water passes from one state to another
are taken as fixed points on the thermometer scale; namely, the zero
corresponds with the temperature of melting ice, and the temperature
of the steam disengaged from water boiling at the normal barometric
pressure (that is 760 millimetres measured at 0°, at the latitude of 45°,
at the sea level) is taken as 100° of the Celsius scale. Thus, the fact
that water liquefies at 0° and boils at 100° is taken as one of its
properties as a definite chemical compound. The weight of a litre of
water at 4° is 1,000 grams, at 0° it is 999·8 grams. The weight of a
litre of ice at 0° is less&mdash;namely, 917 grams; the weight of the same
cubic measure of water vapour at 760 mm. pressure and 100° is only
0·60 gram; the density of the vapour compared with air = 0·62, and
compared with hydrogen = 9.</p>

<p>These data briefly characterise the physical properties of water as
a separate substance. To this may be added that water is a mobile
liquid, colourless, transparent, without taste or smell, &amp;c. Its latent
heat of vaporisation is 534 units, of liquefaction 79 units of heat.<a name="FNanchor_11_57" id="FNanchor_11_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_57" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The large amount of heat stored up in water vapour and also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
liquid water (for its specific heat is greater than that of other liquids)
renders it available in both forms for heating purposes. The chemical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a><br /><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a><br /><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
reactions which water undergoes, and by means of which it is formed,
are so numerous, and so closely allied to the reactions of many other
substances, that it is impossible to describe the majority of them at
this early stage of chemical exposition. We shall become acquainted
with many of them afterwards, but at present we shall only cite certain
compounds formed by water. In order to see clearly the nature of
the various kinds of compounds formed by water we will begin with
the most feeble, which are determined by purely mechanical superficial
properties of the reacting substances.<a name="FNanchor_12_58" id="FNanchor_12_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_58" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>Water is mechanically attracted by many substances; it adheres to
their surfaces just as dust adheres to objects, or one piece of polished
glass adheres to another. Such attraction is termed &lsquo;moistening,&rsquo; &lsquo;soaking,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;absorption of water.&rsquo; Thus water moistens clean glass and
adheres to its surface, is absorbed by the soil, sand, and clay, and does
not flow away from them, but lodges itself between their particles.
Similarly, water soaks into a sponge, cloth, hair, or paper, &amp;c., but fat
and greasy substances in general are not moistened. Attraction of
this kind does not alter the physical or chemical properties of water.
For instance, under these circumstances water, as is known from everyday
experience, may be expelled from objects by drying. Water which
is in any way held mechanically may be dislodged by mechanical
means, by friction, pressure, centrifugal force, &amp;c. Thus water is
squeezed from wet cloth by pressure or centrifugal machines. But
objects which in practice are called dry (because they do not feel wet)
often still contain moisture, as may be proved by heating the object
in a glass tube closed at one end. By placing a piece of paper, dry
earth, or any similar object (especially porous substances) in such a
glass tube, and heating that part of the tube where the object is situated,
it will be remarked that water condenses on the cooler portions of
the tube. The presence of such absorbed, or &lsquo;hygroscopic,&rsquo; water is
generally best detected in non-volatile substances by drying them at
100°, or under the receiver of an air-pump and over substances which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
attract water chemically. By weighing a substance before and after
drying, it is easy to determine the amount of hygroscopic water from
the loss in weight.<a name="FNanchor_13_59" id="FNanchor_13_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_59" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Only in this case the amount of water must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
judged with care, because the loss in weight may sometimes proceed
from the decomposition of the substance itself, with disengagement of
gases or vapour. In making exact weighings the hygroscopic capacity
of substances&mdash;that is, their capacity to absorb moisture&mdash;must be continually
kept in view, as otherwise the weight will be untrue from the
presence of moisture. The quantity of moisture absorbed depends on
the degree of moisture of the atmosphere (that is, on the tension of the
aqueous vapour in it) in which a substance is situated. In an entirely
dry atmosphere, or in a vacuum, the hygroscopic water is expelled,
being converted into vapour; therefore, substances containing hygroscopic
water may be completely dried by placing them in a dry atmosphere
or in a vacuum. The process is aided by heat, as it increases the
tension of the aqueous vapour. Phosphoric anhydride (a white powder),
liquid sulphuric acid, solid and porous calcium chloride, or the white
powder of ignited copper sulphate, are most generally employed in drying
gases. They absorb the moisture contained in air and all gases to
a considerable, but not unlimited, extent. Phosphoric anhydride and
calcium chloride deliquesce, become damp, sulphuric acid changes from
an oily thick liquid into a more mobile liquid, and ignited copper
sulphate becomes blue; after which changes these substances partly
lose their capacity of holding water, and can, if it be in excess, even
give up their water to the atmosphere. We may remark that the order
in which these substances are placed above corresponds with the order
in which they stand in respect to their capacity for absorbing moisture.
Air dried by calcium chloride still contains a certain amount of moisture,
which it can give up to sulphuric acid. The most complete desiccation
takes place with phosphoric anhydride. Water is also removed
from many substances by placing them in a dish over a vessel containing
a substance absorbing water under a glass bell jar.<a name="FNanchor_14_60" id="FNanchor_14_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_60" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The bell jar,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
like the receiver of an air pump, should be hermetically closed. In
this case desiccation takes place; because sulphuric acid, for instance,
first dries the air in the bell jar by absorbing its moisture, the substance
to be dried then parts with its moisture to the dry air, from which it is
again absorbed by the sulphuric acid, &amp;c. Desiccation proceeds still
better under the receiver of an air pump, for then the aqueous vapour
is formed more quickly than in a bell jar full of air.</p>

<p>From what has been said above, it is evident that the transference
of moisture to gases and the absorption of hygroscopic moisture present
great resemblance to, but still are not, chemical combinations with
water. Water, when combined as hygroscopic water, does not lose its
properties and does not form new substances.<a name="FNanchor_15_61" id="FNanchor_15_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_61" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The attraction of water for substances which dissolve in it is of a
different character. In the solution of substances in water there proceeds
a peculiar kind of indefinite combination; a new homogeneous
substance is formed from the two substances taken. But here also the
bond connecting the substances is very unstable. Water containing
different substances in solution boils at a temperature near to its usual
boiling point. From the solution of substances which are lighter than
water itself, there are obtained solutions of a less density than water&mdash;as,
for example, in the solution of alcohol in water; whilst a heavier
substance in dissolving in water gives it a higher specific gravity.
Thus salt water is heavier than fresh.<a name="FNanchor_16_62" id="FNanchor_16_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_62" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>We will consider <i>aqueous solutions</i> somewhat fully, because, among
other reasons, solutions are constantly being formed on the earth and
in the waters of the earth, in plants and in animals, in chemical processes
and in the arts, and these solutions play an important part in
the chemical transformations which are everywhere taking place, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
only because water is everywhere met with, but chiefly because a substance
in solution presents the most favourable conditions for the
process of chemical changes, which require a mobility of parts and a
possible distension of parts. In dissolving, a solid substance acquires
a mobility of parts, and a gas loses its elasticity, and therefore reactions
often take place in solutions which do not proceed in the undissolved
substances. Further, a substance, distributed in water, evidently
breaks up&mdash;that is, becomes more like a gas and acquires a greater
mobility of parts. All these considerations require that in describing
the properties of substances, particular attention should be paid to
their relation to water as a solvent.</p>

as water.</p></div>

<p>It is well known that water dissolves many substances. Salt,
sugar, alcohol, and a number of other substances, dissolve in water and
form homogeneous liquids with it. To demonstrate the solubility of
gases in water, a gas should be taken which has a high co-efficient of
solubility&mdash;for instance, ammonia. This is introduced into a bell jar
(or cylinder, as in fig. 14), which is previously filled with mercury
and stands in a mercury bath. If water be then introduced into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
cylinder, the mercury will rise, owing to the water dissolving the
ammonia gas. If the column of mercury be less than the barometric
column, and if there be sufficient water to dissolve the gas, all the
ammonia will be absorbed by the water. The water is introduced into
the cylinder by a glass pipette, with a bent end. The bent end is put
into water, and the air is sucked out from the upper end. When full
of water, its upper end is closed with the finger, and the bent end
placed in the mercury bath under the orifice of the cylinder. On
blowing into the pipette the water will rise to the surface of the
mercury in the cylinder owing to its lightness. The solubility of a gas
like ammonia may be demonstrated by taking a flask full of the gas,
and closed by a cork with a tube passing through it. On placing the
tube under water, the water will rise into the flask (this may be
accelerated by previously warming the flask), and begin to play like a
fountain inside it. Both the rising of the mercury and the fountain
clearly show the considerable affinity of water for ammonia gas, and
the force acting in this dissolution is rendered evident. A certain
period of time is required both for the homogeneous intermixture of
gases (diffusion) and the process of solution, which depends, not only on
the surface of the participating substances, but also on their nature.
This is seen from experiment. Solutions of different substances
heavier than water, such as salt or sugar, are poured into tall jars.
Pure water is then very carefully poured into these jars (through a
funnel) on to the top of the solutions, so as not to disturb the lower
stratum, and the jars are then left undisturbed. The line of demarcation
between the solution and the pure water will be visible, owing to
their different co-efficients of refraction. Notwithstanding that the
solutions taken are heavier than water, after some time complete
intermixture will ensue. Gay Lussac convinced himself of this fact by
this particular experiment, which he conducted in the cellars under the
Paris Astronomical Observatory. These cellars are well known as the
locality where numerous interesting researches have been conducted,
because, owing to their depth under ground, they have a uniform temperature
during the whole year; the temperature does not change
during the day, and this was indispensable for the experiments on the
diffusion of solutions, in order that no doubt as to the results should
arise from a daily change of temperature (the experiment lasted several
months), which would set up currents in the liquids and intermix their
strata. Notwithstanding the uniformity of the temperature, the substance
in solution in time ascended into the water and distributed itself
uniformly through it, proving that there exists between water and a
substance dissolved in it a particular kind of attraction or striving for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
mutual interpenetration in opposition to the force of gravity. Further,
this effort, or rate of diffusion, is different for salt or sugar or for
various other substances.<a name="FNanchor_16_BIS_63" id="FNanchor_16_BIS_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_BIS_63" class="fnanchor">[16 bis]</a> It follows therefore that a peculiar force
acts in solution, as in actual chemical combinations, and solution is
determined by a particular kind of motion (by the chemical energy
of a substance) which is proper to the substance dissolved and to the
solvent.</p>

<p>Graham made a series of experiments similar to those above
described, and showed that the <i>rate of diffusion</i><a name="FNanchor_17_64" id="FNanchor_17_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_64" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in water is very
variable&mdash;that is, a uniform distribution of a substance in the water
dissolving it is attained in different periods of time with different
solutions. Graham compared diffusive capacity with volatility. There
are substances which diffuse easily, and there are others which diffuse
with difficulty, just as there are more or less volatile substances. Seven
hundred cubic centimetres of water were poured into a jar, and by means
of a syphon (or a pipette) 100 cub. centimetres of a solution containing
10 grams of a substance were cautiously poured in so as to occupy
the lower portion of the jar. After a lapse of several days, successive
layers of 50 cubic centimetres were taken from the top downwards,
and the quantity of substance dissolved in the different layers determined.
Thus, common table salt, after fourteen days, gave the
following amounts (in milligrams) in the respective layers, beginning
from the top: 104, 120, 126, 198, 267, 340, 429, 535, 654, 766, 881,
991, 1,090, 1,187, and 2,266 in the remainder; whilst albumin in the
same time gave, in the first seven layers, a very small amount, and
beginning from the eighth layer, 10, 15, 47, 113, 343, 855, 1,892, and
in the remainder 6,725 milligrams. Thus, the diffusive power of a
solution depends on time and on the nature of the substance dissolved,
which fact may serve, not only for explaining the process of
solution, but also for distinguishing one substance from another.
Graham showed that substances which rapidly diffuse through liquids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
are able to rapidly pass through membranes and crystallise, whilst
substances which diffuse slowly and do not crystallise are <i>colloids</i>,
that is, resemble glue, and penetrate through a membrane slowly, and
form jellies; that is, occur in insoluble forms,<a name="FNanchor_18_65" id="FNanchor_18_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_65" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> as will be explained
in speaking of silica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Hence, if it be desired to increase the rate of solution, recourse
must be had to stirring, shaking, or some such mechanical motion.
But if once a uniform solution is formed, it will remain uniform, no
matter how heavy the dissolved substance is, or how long the solution
be left at rest, which fact again shows the presence of a force holding
together the particles of the body dissolved and of the solvent.<a name="FNanchor_19_66" id="FNanchor_19_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_66" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>In the consideration of the process of solution, besides the conception
of diffusion, another fundamental conception is necessary&mdash;namely,
that of the <i>saturation of solutions</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a><br /><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as moist air may be diluted with any desired quantity of dry
air, so also an indefinitely large quantity of a liquid solvent may be taken,
and yet a uniform solution will be obtained. But more than a definite
quantity of aqueous vapour cannot be introduced into a certain volume
of air at a certain temperature. The excess above the point of
saturation will remain in the liquid state.<a name="FNanchor_20_67" id="FNanchor_20_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_67" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The relation between
water and substances dissolved in it is similar. More than a definite
quantity of a substance cannot, at a certain temperature, dissolve in a
given quantity of water; the excess does not unite with the water.
Just as air or a gas becomes saturated with vapour, so water becomes
saturated with a substance dissolved in it. If an excess of a substance
be added to water which is already saturated with it, it will remain in
its original state, and will not diffuse through the water. The quantity
of a substance (either by volume with gases, or by weight with solids
and liquids) which is capable of saturating 100 parts of water is called
the <i>co-efficient of solubility</i> or the <i>solubility</i>. In 100 grams of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a><br /><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
at 15°, there can be dissolved not more than 35·86 grams of common
salt. Consequently, its solubility at 15° is equal to 35·86.<a name="FNanchor_21_68" id="FNanchor_21_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_68" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is
most important to turn attention to the <i>existence of the solid insoluble
substances of nature</i>, because on them depends the shape of the
substances of the earth's surface, and of plants and animals. There
is so much water on the earth's surface, that were the surface of substances
formed of soluble matters it would constantly change, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
however substantial their forms might be, mountains, river banks and
sea shores, plants and animals, or the habitations and coverings of men,
could not exist for any length of time.<a name="FNanchor_22_69" id="FNanchor_22_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_69" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Substances which are easily soluble in water bear a certain resemblance
to it. Thus sugar and salt in many of their superficial features<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
remind one of ice. Metals, which are not soluble in water, have no
points in common with it, whilst on the other hand they dissolve each
other in a molten state, forming alloys, just as oily substances dissolve
each other; for example, tallow is soluble in petroleum and in olive oil,
although they are all insoluble in water. From this it is evident that
the <i>analogy of substances forming a solution</i> plays an important part,
and as aqueous and all other solutions are liquids, there is good reason
to believe that in the process of solution solid and gaseous substances
change in a physical sense, passing into a liquid state. These considerations
elucidate many points of solution&mdash;as, for instance, the
variation of the co-efficient of solubility with the temperature and the
evolution or absorption of heat in the formation of solutions.</p>

<p>The solubility&mdash;that is, the quantity of a substance necessary for
saturation&mdash;<i>varies with the temperature</i>, and, further, with an increase
in temperature the solubility of solid substances generally increases, and
that of gases decreases; this might be expected, as solid substances by
heating, and gases by cooling, approach to a liquid or dissolved state.<a name="FNanchor_23_70" id="FNanchor_23_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_70" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
A graphic method is often employed to express the variation of solubility
with temperature. On the axis of abscissæ or on a horizontal
line, temperatures are marked out and perpendiculars are raised corresponding
with each temperature, whose length is determined by the
solubility of the salt at that temperature&mdash;expressing, for instance, one
part by weight of a salt in 100 parts of water by one unit of length,
such as a millimetre. By joining the summits of the perpendiculars,
a curve is obtained which expresses the degree of solubility at different
temperatures. For solids, the curve is generally an ascending one&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
recedes from the horizontal line with the rise in temperature. These
curves clearly show by their inclination the degree of rapidity of increase
in solubility with the temperature. Having determined several points
of a curve&mdash;that is, having made a determination of the solubility for
several temperatures&mdash;the solubility at intermediary temperatures may
be determined from the form of the curve so obtained; in this way
the empirical law of solubility may be examined.<a name="FNanchor_24_71" id="FNanchor_24_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_71" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The results of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
research have shown that the solubility of certain salts&mdash;as, for example,
common table salt&mdash;varies comparatively little with the temperature;
whilst for other substances the solubility increases by equal amounts
for equal increments of temperature. Thus, for example, for the
saturation of 100 parts of water by potassium chloride there is required
at 0°, 29·2 parts, at 20°, 34·7, at 40°, 40·2, at 60°, 45·7; and so on,
for every 10° the solubility increases by 2·75 parts by weight of the
salt. Therefore the solubility of the potassium chloride in water may be
expressed by a direct equation: <i>a</i> = 29·2 + 0·275<i>t</i>, where <i>a</i> represents the
solubility at <i>t</i>°. For other salts, more complicated equations are required.
For example, for nitre: <i>a</i> = 13·3 + 0·574<i>t</i> + 0·01717<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> + 0·0000036<i>t</i><sup>3</sup>,
which shows that when <i>t</i> = 0° <i>a</i> = 13·3, when <i>t</i> = 10° <i>a</i> = 20·8, and when
<i>t</i> = 100° <i>a</i> = 246·0.</p>

<p>Curves of solubility give the means of estimating the <i>amount of
salt separated</i> by the cooling to a known extent of a solution saturated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
at a given temperature. For instance, if 200 parts of a solution of
potassium chloride in water saturated at a temperature of 60° be taken,
and it be asked how much of the salt will be separated by cooling the
solution to 0°, if its solubility at 60° = 45·7 and at 0° = 29·2? The
answer is obtained in the following manner: At 60° a saturated
solution contains 45·7 parts of potassium chloride per 100 parts by
weight of water, consequently 145·7 parts by weight of the solution
contain 45·7 parts, or, by proportion, 200 parts by weight of the
solution contain 62·7 parts of the salt. The amount of salt remaining
in solution at 0° is calculated as follows; In 200 grams taken there
will be 137·3 grams of water; consequently, this amount of water is
capable of holding only 40·1 grams of the salt, and therefore in lowering
the temperature from 60° to 0° there should separate from the
solution 62·7 - 40·1 = 22·6 grams of the dissolved salt.</p>

<p>The difference in the solubility of salts, &amp;c., with a rise or fall of
temperature is often taken advantage of, especially in technical work,
for the separation of salts, in intermixture from each other. Thus a
mixture of potassium and sodium chlorides (this mixture is met with in
nature at Stassfurt) is separated from a saturated solution by subjecting
it alternately to boiling (evaporation) and cooling. The sodium
chloride separates out in proportion to the amount of water expelled
from the solution by boiling, and is removed, whilst the potassium
chloride separates out on cooling, as the solubility of this salt rapidly
decreases with a lowering in temperature. Nitre, sugar, and many
other soluble substances are purified (refined) in a similar manner.</p>

<p>Although in the majority of cases the solubility of solids increases
with the temperature, yet there are some solid substances whose
solubilities decrease on heating. Glauber's salt, or sodium sulphate,
forms a particularly instructive example of the case in question. If
this salt be taken in an ignited state (deprived of its water of
crystallisation), then its solubility in 100 parts of water varies with the
temperature in the following manner: at 0°, 5 parts of the salt form a
saturated solution; at 20°, 20 parts of the salt, at 33° more than 50
parts. The solubility, as will be seen, increases with the temperature,
as is the case with nearly all salts; but starting from 33° it suddenly
diminishes, and at a temperature of 40°, less than 50 parts of the salt
dissolve, at 60° only 45 parts of the salt, and at 100° about 43
parts of the salt in 100 parts of water. This phenomenon may be
traced to the following facts: Firstly, that this salt forms various
compounds with water, as will be afterwards explained; secondly,
that at 33° the compound Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 10H<sub>2</sub>O formed from the solution
at lower temperatures, melts; and thirdly, that on evaporation at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
temperature above 33° an anhydrous salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> separates out. It will
be seen from this example how complicated such an apparently simple
phenomenon as solution really is; and all data concerning solutions
lead to the same conclusion. This complexity becomes evident in investigating
the <i>heat of solution</i>. If solution consisted of a physical change
only, then in the solution of gases there would be evolved&mdash;and in the
solution of solids, there would be absorbed&mdash;just that amount of heat
corresponding to the change of state; but in reality a large amount of
heat is always evolved in solution, depending on the fact that in the
process of solution chemical combination takes place accompanied by
an evolution of heat. Seventeen grams of ammonia (this weight corresponds
with its formula NH<sub>3</sub>), in passing from a gaseous into a
liquid state, evolve 4,400 units of heat (latent heat); that is, the
quantity of heat necessary to raise the temperature of 4,400 grams of
water 1°. The same quantity of ammonia, in dissolving in an excess
of water, evolves twice as much heat&mdash;namely 8,800 units&mdash;showing
that the combination with water is accompanied by the evolution of
4,400 units of heat. Further, the chief part of this heat is separated
in dissolving in small quantities of water, so that 17 grams of ammonia,
in dissolving in 18 grams of water (this weight corresponds with its
composition H<sub>2</sub>O), evolve 7,535 units of heat, and therefore the formation
of the solution NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O evolves 3,135 units of heat beyond
that due to the change of state. As in the solution of gases, the heat
of liquefaction (of physical change of state) and of chemical combination
with water are both positive (+), therefore in the <i>solution of gases</i> in
water a <i>heat effect</i> is always observed. This phenomenon is different in
the solution of solid substances, because their passage from a solid to a
liquid state is accompanied by an absorption of heat (negative,- heat),
whilst their chemical combination with water is accompanied by an
evolution of heat (+ heat); consequently, their sum may either be a
cooling effect, when the positive (chemical) portion of heat is less than
the negative (physical), or it may be, on the contrary, a heating effect.
This is actually the case. 124 grams of sodium thiosulphate (employed
in photography) Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O in melting (at 48°) absorbs 9,700 units
of heat, but in dissolving in a large quantity of water at the ordinary
temperature it absorbs 5,700 units of heat, which shows the evolution
of heat (about + 4,000 units), notwithstanding the cooling effect
observed in the process of solution, in the act of the chemical combination
of the salt with water.<a name="FNanchor_25_72" id="FNanchor_25_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_72" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But in most cases solid substances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in dissolving in water evolve heat, notwithstanding the passage into a
liquid state, which indicates so considerable an evolution of (+) heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
in the act of combination with water that it exceeds the absorption of
(-) heat dependent on the passage into a liquid state, Thus, for
instance, calcium chloride, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, magnesium sulphate, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and
many other salts evolve heat in dissolving; for example, 60 grams
of magnesium sulphate evolve about 10,000 units of heat. Therefore,
<i>in the solution of solid bodies</i> either a cooling<a name="FNanchor_26_73" id="FNanchor_26_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_73" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> or a heating<a name="FNanchor_27_74" id="FNanchor_27_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_74" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> effect is
produced, according to the difference of the reacting affinities. When
they are considerable&mdash;that is, when water is with difficulty separated
from the resultant solution, and only with a rise of temperature
(such substances absorb water vapour)&mdash;then much heat is evolved in
the process of solution, just as in many reactions of direct combination,
and therefore a considerable heating of the solution is observed. Of
such a kind, for instance, is the solution of sulphuric acid (oil of vitriol
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), and of caustic soda (NaHO), &amp;c., in water.<a name="FNanchor_28_75" id="FNanchor_28_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_75" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Solution is a reversible reaction; for, if the water be expelled from
a solution, the substance originally taken is obtained again. But it
must be borne in mind that the expulsion of the water taken for
solution is not always accomplished with equal facility, because water
has different degrees of chemical affinity for the substance dissolved.
Thus, if a solution of sulphuric acid, which mixes with water in all
proportions, be heated, it will be found that very different degrees of
heat are required to expel the water. When it is in a large excess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
water is given off at a temperature slightly above 100°, but if it be in
but a small proportion there is such an affinity between it and the
sulphuric acid that at 120°, 150°, 200°, and even at 300°, water is still
retained by the sulphuric acid. The bond between the remaining
quantity of water and the sulphuric acid is evidently stronger than the
bond between the sulphuric acid and the excess of water. The force
acting in solutions is consequently of different intensity, starting from
so feeble an attraction that the properties of water&mdash;as, for instance, its
power of evaporation&mdash;are but very little changed, and ending with
cases of strong attraction between the water and the substance dissolved
in or chemically combined with it. In consideration of the very
important significance of the phenomena, and of the cases of the
breaking up of solutions with separation of water or of the substance
dissolved from them, we shall further discuss them separately, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
having acquainted ourselves with certain peculiarities of the solution
of gases and of solid bodies.</p>

<p>The solubility of gases, which is usually measured by the volume
of gas<a name="FNanchor_29_76" id="FNanchor_29_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_76" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> (at 0° and 760 mm. pressure) per 100 volumes of water, varies
not only with the nature of the gas (and also of the solvent), and
with the temperature, but also with the pressure, because gases themselves
change their volume considerably with the pressure. As might
be expected, (1) gases which are easily liquefied (by pressure and cold)
are more soluble than those which are liquefied with difficulty. Thus,
in 100 volumes of water only two volumes of hydrogen dissolve at 0°
and 760 mm., three volumes of carbonic oxide, four volumes of oxygen,
&amp;c., for these are gases which are liquefied with difficulty; whilst
there dissolve 180 volumes of carbonic anhydride, 130 of nitrous oxide,
and 437 of sulphurous anhydride, for these are gases which are rather
easily liquefied. (2) The solubility of a gas is diminished by heating,
which is easily intelligible from what has been said previously&mdash;the
elasticity of a gas becomes greater, it is removed further from
a liquid state. Thus 100 volumes of water at 0° dissolve 2·5 volumes
of air, and at 20° only 1·7 volume. For this reason cold water, when
brought into a warm room, parts with a portion of the gas dissolved in
it.<a name="FNanchor_30_77" id="FNanchor_30_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_77" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> (3) The quantity of the gas dissolved varies directly with the
pressure. This rule is called the <i>law of Henry and Dalton</i>, and is
applicable to those gases which are little soluble in water. Therefore
a gas is separated from its solution in water in a vacuum, and water
saturated with a gas under great pressure parts with it if the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
be diminished. Thus many mineral springs are saturated underground
with carbonic anhydride under the great pressure of the column of
water above them. On coming to the surface, the water of these springs
boils and foams on giving up the excess of dissolved gas. Sparkling
wines and aërated waters are saturated under pressure with the same
gas. They hold the gas so long as they are in a well-corked vessel.
When the cork is removed and the liquid comes in contact with air at
a lower pressure, part of the gas, unable to remain in solution at a lower
pressure, is separated as froth with the hissing sound familiar to all.
It must be remarked that the law of Henry and Dalton belongs to the
class of <i>approximate laws</i>, like the laws of gases (Gay-Lussac's and
Mariotte's) and many others&mdash;that is, it expresses only a portion of a
complex phenomenon, the limit towards which the phenomenon aims.
The matter is rendered complicated from the influence of the degree of
solubility and of affinity of the dissolved gas for water. Gases which
are little soluble&mdash;for instance, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen&mdash;follow
the law of Henry and Dalton the most closely. Carbonic anhydride
exhibits a decided deviation from the law, as is seen from the determinations
of Wroblewski (1882). He showed that at 0° a cubic centimetre
of water absorbs 1·8 cubic centimetre of the gas under a pressure
of one atmosphere; under 10 atmospheres, 16 cubic centimetres (and
not 18, as it should be according to the law); under 20 atmospheres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
26·6 cubic centimetres (instead of 36), and under 30 atmospheres, 33·7
cubic centimetres.<a name="FNanchor_31_78" id="FNanchor_31_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_78" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> However, as the researches of Sechenoff show,
the absorption of carbonic anhydride within certain limits of change
of pressure, and at the ordinary temperature, by water&mdash;and even by
solutions of salts which are not chemically changed by it, or do not
form compounds with it&mdash;very closely follows the law of Henry and
Dalton, so that the chemical bond between this gas and water is so
feeble that the breaking up of the solution with separation of the gas
is accomplished by a decrease of pressure alone.<a name="FNanchor_32_79" id="FNanchor_32_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_79" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> The case is different
if a considerable affinity exists between the dissolved gas and water.
Then it might even be expected that the gas would not be entirely
separated from water in a vacuum, as should be the case with gases
according to the law of Henry and Dalton. Such gases&mdash;and, in
general, all those which are very soluble&mdash;exhibit a distinct deviation
from the law of Henry and Dalton. As examples, ammonia and hydrochloric
acid gas may be taken. The former is separated by boiling and
decrease of pressure, while the latter is not, but they both deviate distinctly
from the law.</p>

<p>It will be remarked, for instance, from this table that whilst the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
pressure increased 10 times, the solubility of ammonia only increased
4&frac12; times.</p>

<p>A number of examples of such cases of the absorption of gases
by liquids might be cited which do not in any way, even approximately,
agree with the laws of solubility. Thus, for instance, carbonic anhydride
is absorbed by a solution of caustic potash in water, and if
sufficient caustic potash be present it is not separated from the solution
by a decrease of pressure. This is a case of more intimate chemical
combination. A correlation less completely studied, but similar and
clearly chemical, appears in certain cases of the solution of gases in
water, and we shall afterwards find an example of this in the solution
of hydrogen iodide; but we will first stop to consider a remarkable
application of the law of Henry and Dalton<a name="FNanchor_33_80" id="FNanchor_33_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_80" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> in the case of the solution
of a mixture of two gases, and this we must do all the more because
the phenomena which there take place cannot be foreseen without a
clear theoretical representation of the nature of gases.<a name="FNanchor_34_81" id="FNanchor_34_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_81" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><i>The law of partial pressures</i> is as follows:&mdash;The solubility of gases
in intermixture with each other does not depend on the influence of
the total pressure acting on the mixture, but on the influence of that
portion of the total pressure which is due to the volume of each given
gas in the mixture. Thus, for instance, if oxygen and carbonic
anhydride were mixed in equal volumes and exerted a pressure of 760
millimetres, then water would dissolve so much of each of these gases
as would be dissolved if each separately exerted a pressure of half an
atmosphere, and in this case, at 0° one cubic centimetre of water would
dissolve 0·02 cubic centimetre of oxygen and 0·90 cubic centimetre of
carbonic anhydride. If the pressure of a gaseous mixture equals <i>h</i>,
and in <i>n</i> volumes of the mixture there be <i>a</i> volumes of a given gas,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
then its solution will proceed as though this gas were dissolved under
a pressure

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>h</i> × <i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span>
</span>.

That portion of the pressure under influence of
which the solution proceeds is termed the &lsquo;partial&rsquo; pressure.</p>

<p>In order to clearly understand the cause of the law of partial
pressures, an explanation must be given of the fundamental properties
of gases. Gases are elastic and disperse in all directions. We are
led from what we know of gases to the assumption that these fundamental
properties of gases are due to a rapid progressive motion, in
all directions, which is proper to their smallest particles (molecules).<a name="FNanchor_35_82" id="FNanchor_35_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_82" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
These molecules in impinging against an obstacle produce a pressure.
The greater the number of molecules impinging against an obstacle in
a given time, the greater the pressure. The pressure of a separate gas
or of a gaseous mixture depends on the sum of the pressures of all the
molecules, on the number of blows in a unit of time on a unit of
surface, and on the mass and velocity (or the <i>vis viva</i>) of the impinging
molecules. The nature of the different molecules is of no account;
the obstacle is acted on by a pressure due to the sum of their <i>vis viva</i>.
But, in a chemical action such as the solution of gases, the nature of
the impinging molecules plays, on the contrary, the most important
part. In impinging against a liquid, a portion of the gas enters into
the liquid itself, and is held by it so long as other gaseous molecules
impinge against the liquid&mdash;exert a pressure on it. As regards the
solubility of a given gas, for the number of blows it makes on the
surface of a liquid, it is immaterial whether other molecules of gases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
impinge side by side with it or not. Hence, the solubility of a given
gas will be proportional, not to the total pressure of a gaseous mixture,
but to that portion of it which is due to the given gas separately.
Moreover, the saturation of a liquid by a gas depends on the fact that
the molecules of gases that have entered into a liquid do not remain
at rest in it, although they enter in a harmonious kind of motion with
the molecules of the liquid, and therefore they throw themselves off
from the surface of the liquid (just like its vapour if the liquid be
volatile). If in a unit of time an equal number of molecules penetrate
into (leap into) a liquid and leave (or leap out of) a liquid, it is
saturated. It is a case of mobile equilibrium, and not of rest. Therefore,
if the pressure be diminished, the number of molecules departing
from the liquid will exceed the number of molecules entering into the
liquid, and a fresh state of mobile equilibrium only takes place under a
fresh equality of the number of molecules departing from and entering
into the liquid. In this manner the main features of the solution are
explained, and furthermore of that special (chemical) attraction (penetration
and harmonious motion) of a gas for a liquid, which determines
both the measure of solubility and the degree of stability of the
solution produced.</p>

<p>The consequences of the law of partial pressures are exceedingly
numerous and important. All liquids in nature are in contact with the
atmosphere, which, as we shall afterwards see more fully, consists of
an intermixture of gases, chiefly four in number&mdash;oxygen, nitrogen,
carbonic anhydride, and aqueous vapour. 100 volumes of air contain,
approximately, 78 volumes of nitrogen, and about 21 volumes of
oxygen; the quantity of carbonic anhydride, by volume, does not
exceed 0·05. Under ordinary circumstances, the quantity of aqueous
vapour is much greater than this, but it varies of course with climatic
conditions. We conclude from these numbers that the solution of
nitrogen in a liquid in contact with the atmosphere will proceed under
a partial pressure of (78/100) × 760 mm. if the atmospheric pressure equal
760 mm.; similarly, under a pressure of 600 mm. of mercury, the
solution of oxygen will proceed under a partial pressure of about
160 mm., and the solution of carbonic anhydride only under the very
small pressure of 0·4 mm. As, however, the solubility of oxygen in
water is twice that of nitrogen, the ratio of O to N dissolved in water
will be greater than the ratio in air. It is easy to calculate what
quantity of each of the gases will be contained in water, and taking
the simplest case we will calculate what quantity of oxygen, nitrogen,
and carbonic anhydride will be dissolved from air having the above
composition at 0° and 760 mm. pressure. Under a pressure of 760 mm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
1 cubic centimetre of water dissolves 0·0203 cubic centimetre of nitrogen

or 0·00095 cubic centimetre:
hence, 100 cubic centimetres of water will contain at 0° altogether
2·55 cubic centimetres of atmospheric gases, and 100 volumes of air
dissolved in water will contain about 62 p.c. of nitrogen, 34 p.c. of
oxygen, and 4 p.c. of carbonic anhydride. The water of rivers, wells,
&amp;c. usually contains more carbonic anhydride. This proceeds from
the oxidation of organic substances falling into the water. The amount
of oxygen, however, dissolved in water appears to be actually about &#8531;
the dissolved gases, whilst air contains only &#8533; of it by volume.</p>

<p>According to the law of partial pressures, whatever gas be dissolved
in water will be expelled from the solution in an atmosphere of another
gas. This depends on the fact that gases dissolved in water escape
from it in a vacuum, because the pressure is nil. An atmosphere of
another gas acts like a vacuum on a gas dissolved in water. Separation
then proceeds, because the molecules of the dissolved gas no longer
impinge upon the liquid, are not dissolved in it, and those previously
held in solution leave the liquid in virtue of their elasticity.<a name="FNanchor_36_83" id="FNanchor_36_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_83" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
same reason a gas may be entirely expelled from a gaseous solution by
boiling&mdash;at least, in many cases when it does not form particularly
stable compounds with water. In fact the surface of the boiling liquid
will be occupied by aqueous vapour, and therefore all the pressure
acting on the gas will be due to the aqueous vapour. On this account,
the partial pressure of the dissolved gas will be very inconsiderable, and
this is the sole reason why <i>a gas separates from a solution on boiling
the liquid containing it</i>. At the boiling point of water the solubility
of gases in water is still sufficiently great for a considerable quantity
of a gas to remain in solution. The gas dissolved in the liquid is
carried away, together with the aqueous vapour; if boiling be continued
for a long time, all the gas will finally be separated.<a name="FNanchor_37_84" id="FNanchor_37_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_84" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>It is evident that the conception of the partial pressures of gases
should be applied not only to the formations of solutions, but also to all
cases of chemical action of gases. Especially numerous are its applications
to the physiology of respiration, for in these cases it is only the
oxygen of the atmosphere that acts.<a name="FNanchor_38_85" id="FNanchor_38_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_85" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The solution of <i>solids</i>, whilst depending only in a small measure on
the pressure under which solution takes place (because solids and
liquids are almost incompressible), is very clearly dependent on the
temperature. In the great majority of cases the solubility of solids in
water increases with the temperature; and further, the rapidity of
solution increases also. The latter is determined by the rapidity of
diffusion of the solution formed into the remainder of the water. The
solution of a solid in water, although it is as with gases, a physical
passage into a liquid state, is determined, however, by its chemical
affinity for water; this is clearly shown from the fact that in solution
there occurs a diminution in volume, a change in the boiling point of
water, a change in the tension of its vapour, in the freezing point, and
in many similar properties. If solution were a physical, and not a
chemical, phenomenon, it would naturally be accompanied by an
increase and not by a diminution of volume, because generally in
melting a solid increases in volume (its density diminishes). <i>Contraction</i>
is the usual phenomenon accompanying solution and takes place even
in the addition of solutions to water,<a name="FNanchor_39_86" id="FNanchor_39_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_86" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and in the solution of liquids
in water,<a name="FNanchor_40_87" id="FNanchor_40_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_87" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> just as happens in the combination of substances when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
evidently new substances are produced.<a name="FNanchor_41_88" id="FNanchor_41_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_88" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The contraction which takes
place in solution is, however, very small, a fact which depends on the
small compressibility of solids and liquids, and on the insignificance of
the compressing force acting in solution.<a name="FNanchor_42_89" id="FNanchor_42_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_89" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> The change of volume which
takes place in the solution of solids and liquids, or the alteration in
specific gravity<a name="FNanchor_43_90" id="FNanchor_43_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_90" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> corresponding with it, depends on peculiarities of the
dissolving substances, and of water, and, in the majority of cases, is not
proportional to the quantity of the substance dissolved,<a name="FNanchor_44_91" id="FNanchor_44_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_91" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> showing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
existence of a chemical force between the solvent and the substance
dissolved which is of the same nature as in all other forms of chemical
reaction.<a name="FNanchor_45_92" id="FNanchor_45_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_92" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The feeble development of the chemical affinities acting in solutions
of solids becomes evident from those multifarious methods by which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<i>their solutions are decomposed</i>, whether they be saturated or not. On
heating (absorption of heat), on cooling, and by internal forces alone,
aqueous solutions in many cases separate into their components or their
definite compounds with water. The water contained in solutions is
removed from them as vapour, or, by freezing, in the form of ice,<a name="FNanchor_46_93" id="FNanchor_46_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_93" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> but
the <i>tension of the vapour of water</i><a name="FNanchor_47_94" id="FNanchor_47_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_94" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> held in solution is less than that of
water in a free state, and the <i>temperature of the formation of ice</i> from
solutions is lower than 0°. Further, both the diminution of vapour tension
and the lowering of the freezing point proceed, in dilute solutions,
almost in proportion to the amount of a substance dissolved.<a name="FNanchor_48_95" id="FNanchor_48_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_95" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Thus, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
per 100 grams of water there be in solution 1, 5, 10 grams of common
salt (NaCl), then at 100° the vapour tension of the solutions decreases
by 4, 21, 43 mm. of the barometric column, against 760 mm., or the
vapour tension of water, whilst the freezing points are -0·58°, -2·91°,
and -6·10° respectively. The above figures<a name="FNanchor_49_96" id="FNanchor_49_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_96" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> are almost proportional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a><br /><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to the amounts of salt in solution (1, 5, and 10 per 100 of water).
Furthermore, it has been shown by experiment that the ratio of the
diminution of vapour tension to the vapour tension of water at different
temperatures in a given solution is an almost constant quantity,<a name="FNanchor_50_97" id="FNanchor_50_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_97" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and
that for every (dilute) solution the ratio between the diminution of vapour
tension and of the freezing point is also a tolerably constant quantity.<a name="FNanchor_51_98" id="FNanchor_51_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_98" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The diminution of the vapour tension of solutions explains the rise
in boiling point due to the solution of solid non-volatile bodies in
water. The temperature of a vapour is the same as that of the solution
from which it is generated, and therefore it follows that the
aqueous vapour given off from a solution will be superheated. A
saturated solution of common salt boils at 108·4°, a solution of 335
parts of nitre in 100 parts of water at 115·9°, and a solution of 325
parts of potassium chloride in 100 parts of water at 179°, if the
temperature of ebullition be determined by immersing the thermometer
bulb in the liquid itself. This is another proof of the bond which
exists between water and the substance dissolved. And this bond is
seen still more clearly in those cases (for example, in the solution of
nitric or formic acid in water) where the solution boils at a higher
temperature than either water or the volatile substance dissolved in it.
For this reason the solutions of certain gases&mdash;for instance, hydriodic
or hydrochloric acid&mdash;boil above 100°.</p>

<p>The separation of ice from solutions<a name="FNanchor_52_99" id="FNanchor_52_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_99" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> explains both the phenomenon,
well known to sailors, that the ice formed from salt water gives
fresh water, and also the fact that by freezing, just as by evaporation,
a solution is obtained which is richer in salts than before. This is
taken advantage of in cold countries for obtaining a liquor from sea
water, which is then evaporated for the extraction of salt.</p>

<p>On the removal of part of the water from a solution (by evaporation
or the separation of ice), a saturated solution should be obtained, and
then the solid substance dissolved should separate out. Solutions saturated
at a certain temperature should also separate out a corresponding
portion of the substance dissolved if they be reduced, by cooling,<a name="FNanchor_53_100" id="FNanchor_53_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_100" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> to a
temperature at which the water can no longer hold the former quantity
of the substance in solution. If this separation, by cooling a saturated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
solution or by evaporation, take place slowly, <i>crystals</i> of the substance
dissolved are in many cases formed; and this is the method by which
crystals of soluble salts are usually obtained. Certain solids very
easily separate out from their solutions in perfectly formed crystals,
which may attain very large dimensions. Such are nickel sulphate,
alum, sodium carbonate, chrome-alum, copper sulphate, potassium ferricyanide,
and a whole series of other salts. The most remarkable circumstance
in this is that many solids in separating out from an aqueous
solution retain a portion of water, forming crystallised solid substances
which contain water. A portion of the water previously in the solution
remains in the separated crystals. The water which is thus retained
is called the <i>water of crystallisation</i>. Alum, copper sulphate, Glauber's
salt, and magnesium sulphate contain such water, but neither sal-ammoniac,
table salt, nitre, potassium chlorate, silver nitrate, nor
sugar, contains any water of crystallisation. One and the same
substance may separate out from a solution with or without water
of crystallisation, according to the temperature at which the crystals are
formed. Thus common salt in crystallising from its solution in water
at the ordinary or at a higher temperature does not contain water of
crystallisation. But if its separation from the solution takes place
at a low temperature, namely below -5°, then the crystals contain
38 parts of water in 100 parts. Crystals of the same substance which
separate out at different temperatures may contain different amounts
of water of crystallisation. This proves to us that a solid dissolved in
water may form various compounds with it, differing in their properties
and composition, and capable of appearing in a solid separate form like
many ordinary definite compounds. This is indicated by the numerous
properties and phenomena connected with solutions, and gives reason
for thinking that there exist in solutions themselves such compounds of
the substance dissolved, and the solvent or compounds similar to them,
only in a liquid partly decomposed form. Even the <i>colour of solutions</i>
may often confirm this opinion. Copper sulphate forms crystals having
a blue colour and containing water of crystallisation. If the water of
crystallisation be removed by heating the crystals to redness, a colourless
anhydrous substance is obtained (a white powder). From this it
may be seen that the blue colour belongs to the compound of the copper
salt with water. Solutions of copper sulphate are all blue, and consequently
they contain a compound similar to the compound formed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the salt with its water of crystallisation. Crystals of cobalt chloride
when dissolved in an anhydrous liquid&mdash;like alcohol, for instance&mdash;give
a blue solution, but when they are dissolved in water a red solution is
obtained. Crystals from the aqueous solution, according to Professor
Potilitzin, contain six times as much water (CoCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O) for a given
weight of the salt, as those violet crystals (CoCl<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O) which are
formed by the evaporation of an alcoholic solution.</p>

<p>That solutions contain particular compounds with water is further
shown by the phenomena of supersaturated solutions, of so-called cryohydrates,
of solutions of certain acids having constant boiling points,
and the properties of compounds containing water of crystallisation
whose data it is indispensable to keep in view in the consideration of
solutions.</p>

<p>Supersaturated solutions exhibit the following phenomena:&mdash;On
the refrigeration of a saturated solution of certain salts,<a name="FNanchor_54_101" id="FNanchor_54_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_101" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> if the liquid
be brought under certain conditions, the excess of the solid may
sometimes remain in solution and not separate out. A great number
of substances, and more especially sodium sulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or
Glauber's salt, easily form supersaturated solutions. If boiling water
be saturated with this salt, and the solution be poured off from any
remaining undissolved salt, and, the boiling being still continued, the
vessel holding the solution be well closed by cotton wool, or by fusing
up the vessel, or by covering the solution with a layer of oil, then it
will he found that this saturated solution does not separate out any
Glauber's salt whatever on cooling down to the ordinary or even to a
much lower temperature; although without the above precautions a
salt separates out on cooling, in the form of crystals, which contain
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;that is, 180 parts of water for 142 parts of anhydrous
salt. The supersaturated solution may be moved about or shaken
inside the vessel holding it, and no crystallisation will take place; the
salt remains in the solution in as large an amount as at a higher temperature.
If the vessel holding the supersaturated solution be opened and
a crystal of Glauber's salt be thrown in, crystallisation suddenly takes
place.<a name="FNanchor_55_102" id="FNanchor_55_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_102" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> A considerable rise in temperature is noticed during this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
rapid separation of crystals, which is due to the fact that the salt,
previously in a liquid state, passes into a solid state. This bears some resemblance
to the fact that water maybe cooled below 0° (even to -10°)
if it be left at rest, under certain circumstances, and evolves heat in
suddenly crystallising. Although from this point of view there is a
resemblance, yet in reality the phenomenon of supersaturated solutions
is much more complicated. Thus, on cooling, a saturated solution of
Glauber's salt deposits crystals containing Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>0,<a name="FNanchor_56_103" id="FNanchor_56_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_103" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> or 126 parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of water per 142 parts of anhydrous salt, and not 180 parts of water,
as in the above-mentioned salt. The crystals containing 7H<sub>2</sub>O are
distinguished for their instability; if they stand in contact not only
with crystals of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, but with many other substances, they
immediately become opaque, forming a mixture of anhydrous and deca-hydrated
salts. It is evident that between water and a soluble substance
there may be established different kinds of greater or less stable
equilibrium, of which solutions form a particular case.<a name="FNanchor_57_104" id="FNanchor_57_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_104" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Solutions of salts on refrigeration below 0° deposit ice or crystals
(which then frequently contain water of crystallisation) of the salt
dissolved, and on reaching a certain degree of concentration they
solidify in their entire mass. These solidified masses are termed <i>cryohydrates</i>.
My researches on solutions of common salt (1868) showed
that its solution solidifies when it reaches a composition NaCl + 10H<sub>2</sub>O
(180 parts of water per 58·5 parts of salt), which takes place at
about -23°. The solidified solution melts at the same temperature,
and both the portion melted and the remainder preserve the above
composition. Guthrie (1874&ndash;1876) obtained the cryohydrates of many
salts, and he showed that certain of them are formed like the above at
comparatively low temperatures, whilst others (for instance, corrosive
sublimate, alums, potassium chlorate, and various colloids) are formed
on a slight cooling, to -2° or even before.<a name="FNanchor_58_105" id="FNanchor_58_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_105" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> In the case of common salt,
the cryohydrate with 10 molecules of water, and in the case of sodium
nitrate, the cryohydrate<a name="FNanchor_59_106" id="FNanchor_59_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_106" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> with 7 molecules of water (<i>i.e.</i> 126 parts
of water per 85 of salt) should be accepted as established substances,
capable of passing from a solid to a liquid state and conversely; and
therefore it may be thought that in cryohydrates we have solutions
which are not only undecomposable by cold, but also have a definite
composition which would present a fresh case of definite equilibrium
between the solvent and the substance dissolved.</p>

<p>The formation of definite but unstable compounds in the process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
solution becomes evident from the phenomena of a marked decrease of
vapour tension, or from the rise of the temperature of ebullition which
occurs in the solution of certain volatile liquids and gases in water.
As an example, we will take hydriodic acid, HI, a gas which liquefies,
giving a liquid which boils at -20°. A solution of it containing 57
p.c. of hydriodic acid is distinguished by the fact that if it be heated
the hydriodic acid volatilises together with the water in the same proportions
as they occur in the solution, therefore such a solution may be
distilled unchanged. The solution boils at a higher temperature than
water, at 127°. A portion of the physical properties of the gas and
water have in this case already disappeared&mdash;a new substance is formed,
which has its definite boiling point. To put it more correctly, this is
not the temperature of ebullition, but the temperature at which the
compound formed decomposes, forming the vapours of the products of
dissociation, which, on cooling, re-combine. Should a less amount of
hydriodic acid be dissolved in water than the above, then, on heating
such a solution, water only at first distils over, until the solution
attains the above-mentioned composition; it will then distil over
unaltered. If more hydriodic acid be passed into such a solution a
fresh quantity of the gas will dissolve, but it passes off with great
ease, like air from water. It must not, however, be thought that those
forces which determine the formation of ordinary gaseous solutions
play no part whatever in the formation of a solution having a definite
boiling point; that they do react is shown from the fact that such constant
gaseous solutions vary in their composition under different
pressures.<a name="FNanchor_60_107" id="FNanchor_60_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_107" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It is not, therefore, at every, but only at the ordinary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
atmospheric pressure that a constant boiling solution of hydriodic acid
will contain 57 p.c. of the gas. At another pressure the proportion of
water and hydriodic acid will be different. It varies, however, judging
from observations made by Roscoe, very little for considerable variations
of pressure. This variation in composition directly indicates that
pressure exerts an influence on the formation of unstable chemical
compounds which are easily dissociated (with formation of a gas), just
as it influences the solution of gases, only the latter is influenced to a
more considerable degree than the former.<a name="FNanchor_61_108" id="FNanchor_61_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_108" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Hydrochloric, nitric, and
other acids form <i>solutions having definite boiling points</i>, like that of
hydriodic acid. They show further the common property, if containing
but a small proportion of water, that they <i>fume in air</i>. Strong solutions
of nitric, hydrochloric, hydriodic, and other gases are even termed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
&lsquo;fuming acids.&rsquo; The fuming liquids contain a definite compound whose
temperature of ebullition (decomposition) is higher than 100°, and contain
also an excess of the volatile substance dissolved, which exhibits a
capacity to combine with water and form a hydrate, whose vapour
tension is less than that of aqueous vapour. On evaporating in air,
this dissolved substance meets the atmospheric moisture and forms a
visible vapour (fumes) with it, which consists of the above-mentioned
compound. The attraction or affinity which binds, for instance,
hydriodic acid with water is evinced not only in the evolution of heat
and the diminution of vapour tension (rise of boiling point), but also
in many purely chemical relations. Thus hydriodic acid is produced
from iodine and hydrogen sulphide in the presence of water, but unless
water is present this reaction does not take place.<a name="FNanchor_62_109" id="FNanchor_62_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_109" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Many compounds containing water of crystallisation are solid substances
(when melted they are already solutions&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> liquids); furthermore,
they are capable of being formed from solutions, like ice or
aqueous vapour. They may be called <i>crystallo-hydrates</i>. Inasmuch as
the direct presence of ice or aqueous vapour cannot be admitted in
solutions (for these are liquids), although the presence of water may
be, so also there is no basis for acknowledging the presence in solutions
of crystallo-hydrates, although they are obtained from solutions as
such.<a name="FNanchor_63_110" id="FNanchor_63_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_110" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> It is evident that such substances present one of the many
forms of equilibrium between water and a substance dissolved in it.
This form, however, reminds one, in all respects, of solutions&mdash;that is,
aqueous compounds which are more or less easily decomposed, with
separation of water and the formation of a less aqueous or an anhydrous
compound. In fact, there are not a few crystals containing water
which lose a part of their water at the ordinary temperature. Of such
a kind, for instance, are the crystals of soda, or sodium carbonate,
which, when separated from an aqueous solution at the ordinary
temperature, are quite transparent; but when left exposed to air, lose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a portion of their water, becoming opaque, and, in the process, lose
their crystalline appearance, although preserving their original form.
This process of the separation of water at the ordinary temperature
is termed the <i>efflorescence</i> of crystals. Efflorescence takes place more
rapidly under the receiver of an air pump, and especially at a gentle
heat. This breaking up of a crystal is dissociation at the ordinary
temperature. Solutions are decomposed in exactly the same manner.<a name="FNanchor_64_111" id="FNanchor_64_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_111" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
The tension of the aqueous vapour which is given off from crystallo-hydrates
is naturally, as with solutions, less than the vapour tension of
water itself<a name="FNanchor_65_112" id="FNanchor_65_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_112" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> at the same temperature, and therefore many anhydrous
salts which are capable of combining with water absorb aqueous vapour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
from moist air; that is, they act like a cold body on which water is
deposited from steam. It is on this that the desiccation of gases is
based, and it must further be remarked in this respect that certain
substances&mdash;for instance, potassium carbonate (K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and calcium
chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>)&mdash;not only absorb the water necessary for the formation
of a solid crystalline compound, but also give solutions, or <i>deliquesce</i>,
as it is termed, in moist air. Many crystals do not effloresce in the
least at the ordinary temperature; for example, copper sulphate, which
may be preserved for an indefinite length of time without efflorescing,
but when placed under the receiver of an air pump, if efflorescence be
once started, it goes on at the ordinary temperature. The temperature
at which the complete separation of water from crystals takes
place varies considerably, not only for different substances, but also for
different portions of the contained water. Very often the temperature
at which dissociation begins is very much higher than the boiling point
of water. So, for example, copper sulphate, which contains 36 p.c. of
water, gives up 28·8 p.c. at 100°, and the remaining quantity, namely
7·2 p.c., only at 240°. Alum, out of the 45·5 p.c. of water which it
contains, gives up 18·9 p.c. at 100°, 17·7 p.c. at 120°, 7·7 p.c. at 180°,
and 1 p.c. at 280°; it only loses the last quantity (1 p.c.) at its temperature
of decomposition. These examples clearly show that the
annexation of water of crystallisation is accompanied by a rather profound,
although, in comparison with instances which we shall consider
later, still inconsiderable, change of its properties. In certain cases the
water of crystallisation is only given off when the solid form of the
substance is destroyed: when the crystals melt on heating. The
crystals are then said <i>to melt in their water of crystallisation</i>. Further,
after the separation of the water, a solid substance remains behind, so
that by further heating it acquires a solid form. This is seen most
clearly in crystals of sugar of lead or lead acetate, which melt in their
water of crystallisation at a temperature of 56·25°, and in so doing
begin to lose water. On reaching a temperature of 100° the sugar of
lead solidifies, having lost all its water; and then at a temperature of
280°, the anhydrous and solidified salt again melts.<a name="FNanchor_65_BIS_113" id="FNanchor_65_BIS_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_BIS_113" class="fnanchor">[65 bis]</a></p>

<p>It is most important to recognise in respect to the water of crystallisation
that its ratio to the quantity of the substance with which it
is combined is always a constant quantity. However often we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
prepare copper sulphate, we shall always find 36·14 p.c. of water in its
crystals, and these crystals always lose four-fifths of their water at
100°, and one-fifth of the whole amount of the water contained remains
in the crystals at 100°, and is only expelled from them at a temperature
of about 240°. What has been said about crystals of copper sulphate
refers also to crystals of every other substance, which contain water of
crystallisation. It is impossible in any of these cases to increase either
the relative proportion of the salt or of the water, without changing
the homogeneity of the substance. If once a portion of the water be
lost&mdash;for instance, if once efflorescence takes place&mdash;a mixture is obtained,
and not a homogeneous substance, namely a mixture of a substance
deprived of water with a substance which has not yet lost water&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
decomposition has already commenced. This constant ratio is
an example of the fact that in chemical compounds the quantity of the
component parts is quite definite; that is, it is an example of the so-called
<i>definite chemical compounds</i>. They may be distinguished from
solutions, and from all other so-called indefinite chemical compounds,
in that at least one, and sometimes both, of the component parts may
be added in a large quantity to an indefinite chemical compound, without
destroying its homogeneity, as in solutions, whilst it is impossible
to add any one of the component parts to a definite chemical compound
without destroying the homogeneity of the entire mass. Definite
chemical compounds only decompose at a certain rise in temperature;
on a lowering in temperature they do not, at least with very few exceptions,
yield their components like solutions which form ice or compounds
with water of crystallisation. This leads to the assumption
that solutions contain water as water,<a name="FNanchor_66_114" id="FNanchor_66_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_114" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> although it may sometimes be
in a very small quantity. Therefore solutions which are capable of
solidifying completely (for instance, crystallo-hydrates capable of melting)
such as the compound of 84&frac12; parts of sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, with
15&frac12; parts of water, H<sub>2</sub>O, or H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O (or H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>5</sub>), appear as true
definite chemical compounds. If, then, we imagine such a definite
compound in a liquid state, and admit that it partially decomposes in
this state, separating water&mdash;not as ice or vapour (for then the system
would be heterogeneous, including substances in different physical
states), but in a liquid form, when the system will be homogeneous&mdash;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
shall form an idea of a solution as an unstable, dissociating fluid
state of equilibrium between water and the substance dissolved. Moreover,
it should be remarked that, judging by experiment, many substances
give with water not one but <i>diverse</i> compounds,<a name="FNanchor_67_115" id="FNanchor_67_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_115" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> which is seen in the

<p>We saw above that copper sulphate loses four-fifths of its water at
100° and the remainder at 240°. This means that there are two definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
compounds of water with the anhydrous salt. Washing soda or carbonate
of sodium, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> separates out as crystals, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O,
containing 62·9 p.c. of water by weight, from its solutions at the
ordinary temperature. When a solution of the same salt deposits
crystals at a low temperature, about -20°, then these crystals contain
71·8 parts of water per 28·2 parts of anhydrous salt. Further, the
crystals are obtained together with ice, and are left behind when it
melts. If ordinary soda, with 62·9 p.c. of water, be cautiously melted
in its own water of crystallisation, there remains a salt, in a solid state,
containing only 14·5 p.c. of water, and a liquid is obtained which contains
the solution of a salt which separates out crystals at 34°, which
contain 46 p.c. of water and do not effloresce in air. Lastly, if a supersaturated
solution of soda be prepared, then at temperatures below 8°
it deposits crystals containing 54·3 p.c. of water. Thus as many as
five compounds of anhydrous soda with water are known; and they are
dissimilar in their properties and crystalline form, and even in their
solubility. It is to be observed that the greatest amount of water in
the crystals corresponds with a temperature of -20°, and the smallest
to the highest temperature. There is apparently no relation between
the above quantities of water and the salts, but this is only because in
each case the amount of water and anhydrous salt was given in percentages;
but if it be calculated for one and the same quantity of
anhydrous salt, or of water, a great regularity will be observed in the
amounts of the component parts in all these compounds. It appears
that for 106 parts of anhydrous salt in the crystals separated out at
-20° there are 270 parts of water; in the crystals obtained at 15° there
are 180 parts of water; in the crystals obtained from a supersaturated
solution 126 parts, in the crystals which separate out at 34°, 90 parts,
and the crystals with the smallest amount of water, 18 parts. On
comparing these quantities of water it may easily be seen that they are
in simple proportion to each other, for they are all divisible by 18, and
are in the ratio 15 : 10 : 7 : 5 : 1. Naturally, direct experiment,
however carefully it be conducted, is hampered with errors, but taking
these unavoidable experimental errors into consideration, it will be
seen that for a given quantity of an anhydrous substance there occur,
in several of its compounds with water, quantities of water which are
in very simple multiple proportion. This is observed in, and is common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
to, all definite chemical compounds. This rule is called <i>the law of
multiple proportions</i>. It was discovered by Dalton, and will be evolved
in further detail subsequently in this work. For the present we
will only state that the law of definite composition enables the composition
of substances to be expressed by formulæ, and the law of
multiple proportions permits the application of whole numbers as coefficients
of the symbols of the elements in these formulæ. Thus the
formula Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O shows directly that in this crystallo-hydrate
there are 180 parts of water to 106 parts by weight of the anhydrous
salt, because the formula of soda, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, directly answers to a weight
of 106, and the formula of water to 18 parts, by weight, which are here
taken 10 times.</p>

<p>In the above examples of the combinations of water, we saw the
gradually increasing intensity of the bond between water and a
substance with which it forms a homogeneous compound. There is a
series of such compounds with water, in which the water is held with
very great force, and is only given up at a very high temperature, and
sometimes cannot be separated by any degree of heat without the entire
decomposition of the substance. In these compounds there is generally
no outward sign whatever of their containing water. A perfectly new
substance is formed from an anhydrous substance and water, in which
sometimes the properties of neither one nor the other substance are
observable. In the majority of cases, a considerable amount of heat is
evolved in the formation of such compounds with water. Sometimes
the heat evolved is so intense that a red heat is produced and light
is emitted. It is hardly to be wondered at, after this, that stable
compounds are formed by such a combination. Their decomposition
requires great heat; a large amount of work is necessary to separate
them into their component parts. All such compounds are definite,
and, generally, completely and clearly definite. The number of such
definite compounds with water or <i>hydrates</i>, in the narrow sense of the
word, is generally inconsiderable for each anhydrous substance; in the
greater number of cases, there is formed only one such combination of a
substance with water, one hydrate, having so great a stability. The
water contained in these compounds is often called <i>water of constitution</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
water which enters into the structure or composition of the given
substance. By this it is desired to express, that in other cases the
molecules of water are, as it were, separate from the molecules of that
substance with which it is combined. It is supposed that in the formation
of hydrates this water, even in the smallest particles, forms one
complete whole with the anhydrous substance. Many examples of
the formation of such hydrates might be cited. The most familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
example in practice is the hydrate of lime, or so-called &lsquo;slaked&rsquo; lime.
Lime is prepared by burning limestone, by which the carbonic anhydride
is expelled from it, and there remains a white stony mass, which is
dense, compact, and rather tenacious. Lime is usually sold in this
form, and bears the name of &lsquo;quick&rsquo; or &lsquo;unslaked&rsquo; lime. If water be
poured over such lime, a great rise in temperature is remarked either
directly, or after a certain time. The whole mass becomes hot, part of
the water is evaporated, the stony mass in absorbing water crumbles into
powder, and if the water be taken in sufficient quantity and the lime
be pure and well burnt, not a particle of the original stony mass is left&mdash;it
all crumbles into powder. If the water be in excess, then naturally
a portion of it remains and forms a solution. This process is called
&lsquo;slaking&rsquo; lime. Slaked lime is used in practice in intermixture with
sand as mortar. Slaked lime is a definite hydrate of lime. If it is
dried at 100° it retains 24·3 p.c. of water. This water can only be
expelled at a temperature above 400°, and then quicklime is re-obtained.
The heat evolved in the combination of lime with water is so intense
that it can set fire to wood, sulphur, gunpowder, &amp;c. Even on mixing
lime with ice the temperature rises to 100°. If lime be moistened with a
small quantity of water in the dark, a luminous effect is observed. But,
nevertheless, water may still be separated from this hydrate.<a name="FNanchor_71_119" id="FNanchor_71_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_119" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> If
phosphorus be burnt in dry air, a white substance called &lsquo;phosphoric
anhydride&rsquo; is obtained. It combines with water with such energy, that
the experiment must be conducted with great caution. A red heat is
produced in the formation of the compound, and it is impossible to
separate the water from the resultant hydrate at any temperature.
The hydrate formed by phosphoric anhydride is a substance which is
totally undecomposable into its original component parts by the action
of heat. Almost as energetic a combination occurs when sulphuric
anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>, combines with water, forming its hydrate, sulphuric
acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. In both cases definite compounds are produced, but
the latter substance, as a liquid, and capable of decomposition by
heat, forms an evident link with solutions. If 80 parts of sulphuric
anhydride retain 18 parts of water, this water cannot be separated from
the anhydride, even at a temperature of 300°. It is only by the
addition of phosphoric anhydride, or by a series of chemical transformations,
that this water can be separated from its compound with
sulphuric anhydride. Oil of vitriol, or sulphuric acid, is such a compound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
If a larger proportion of water be taken, it will combine
with the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; for instance, if 36 parts of water per 80 parts of
sulphuric anhydride be taken, a compound is formed which crystallises
in the cold, and melts at +8°, whilst oil of vitriol does not solidify even
at -30°. If still more water be taken, the oil of vitriol will dissolve in
the remaining quantity of water. An evolution of heat takes place,
not only on the addition of the water of constitution, but in a less
degree on further additions of water.<a name="FNanchor_72_120" id="FNanchor_72_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_120" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> And therefore there is no
distinct boundary, but only a gradual transition, between those
chemical phenomena which are expressed in the formation of solutions
and those which take place in the formation of the most stable
hydrates.<a name="FNanchor_73_121" id="FNanchor_73_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_121" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>We have thus considered many aspects and degrees of combination
of various substances with water, or instances of the compounds of
water, when it and other substances form new homogeneous substances,
which in this case will evidently be complex&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> made up of different
substances&mdash;and although they are homogeneous, yet it must be
admitted that in them there exist those component parts which entered
into their composition, inasmuch as these parts may be re-obtained from
them. It must not be imagined that water really exists in hydrate of
lime, any more than that ice or steam exists in water. When we say
that water occurs in the composition of a certain hydrate, we only wish
to point out that there are chemical transformations in which it is
possible to obtain that hydrate by means of water, and other transformations
in which this water may be separated out from the hydrate.
This is all simply expressed by the words, that water enters into the
composition of this hydrate. If a hydrate be formed by feeble bonds,
and be decomposed even at the ordinary temperature, and be a liquid,
then the water appears as one of the products of dissociation, and
this gives an idea of what solutions are, and forms the fundamental
distinction between them and other hydrates in which the water is
combined with greater stability.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_47" id="Footnote_1_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_47"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> In practice, the chemist has to continually deal with gases, and gases are often
collected over water; in which case a certain amount of water passes into vapour, and
this vapour mixes with the gases. It is therefore most important that he should be able
to calculate the amount of water or of <i>moisture in air and other gases</i>. Let us
imagine a cylinder standing in a mercury bath, and filled with a dry gas whose volume
equals <i>v</i>, temperature <i>t</i>°, and pressure or tension <i>h</i> mm. (<i>h</i> millimetres of the column of
mercury at 0°). We will introduce water into the cylinder in such a quantity that a small
part remains in the liquid state, and consequently that the gas will be saturated with
aqueous vapour; the volume of the gas will then increase (if a larger quantity of water be
taken some of the gas will he dissolved in it, and the volume may therefore he diminished).
We will further suppose that, after the addition of the water, the temperature remains
constant; then since the volume increases, the mercury in the cylinder falls, and therefore
the pressure as well as the volume is increased. In order to investigate the phenomenon
we will artificially increase the pressure, and reduce the volume to the original
volume <i>v</i>. Then the pressure or tension will be greater than <i>h</i>, namely <i>h</i> + <i>f</i>, which
means that by the introduction of aqueous vapour the pressure of the gas is increased.
The researches of Dalton, Gay-Lussac, and Regnault showed that this increase is equal
to the maximum pressure which is proper to the aqueous vapour at the temperature at
which the observation is made. The maximum pressure for all temperatures may be
found in the tables made from observations on the pressure of aqueous vapour. The
quantity <i>f</i> will be equal to this maximum pressure of aqueous vapour. This may be
expressed thus: the maximum tension of aqueous vapour (and of all other vapours)
saturating a space in a vacuum or in any gas is the same. This rule is known as
<i>Dalton's law</i>. Thus we have a volume of dry gas <i>v</i>, under a pressure <i>h</i>, and a volume
of moist gas, saturated with vapour, under a pressure <i>h</i> + <i>f</i>. The volume <i>v</i> of the dry
gas under a pressure <i>h</i> + <i>f</i> occupies, from Boyle's law, a volume

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>vh</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>h</i> + <i>f</i></span>
</span>

consequently the
volume occupied by the aqueous vapour under the pressure <i>h</i> + <i>f</i> equals <i>v</i> -

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>vh</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>h</i> + <i>f</i></span>

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>vf</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>h</i> + <i>f</i></span>
</span>.

Thus the volumes of the dry gas and of the moisture which occurs in it, at a
pressure <i>h</i> + <i>f</i>, are in the ratio <i>f</i> : <i>h</i>. And, therefore, if the aqueous vapour saturates a
space at a pressure <i>n</i>, the volumes of the dry air and of the moisture which is contained
in it are in the ratio (<i>n</i> - <i>f</i>) : <i>f</i>, where <i>f</i> is the pressure of the vapour according to the
tables of vapour tension. Thus, if a volume N of a gas saturated with moisture
be measured at a pressure H, then the volume of the gas, when dry, will be equal to
N

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">H - f</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">H</span>
</span>.

In fact, the entire volume N must be to the volume of dry gas <i>x</i> as H is to
H - <i>f</i>; therefore, N : <i>x</i> = H : H - <i>f</i>, from which <i>x</i> = N

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">H - f</span>

<span class="fdn">H</span>
</span>.

Under any other pressure&mdash;for
instance, 760 mm.&mdash;The volume of dry gas will be

</span>,

and we thus obtain
the following practical rule: If a volume of a gas saturated with aqueous vapour be
measured at a pressure H mm., then the volume of dry gas contained in it will be
obtained by finding the volume corresponding to the pressure H, less the pressure due
to the aqueous vapour at the temperature observed. For example, 37·5 cubic centimetres
of air saturated with aqueous vapour were measured at a temperature of 15·3°,
and under a pressure of 747·3 mm. of mercury (at 0°). What will be the volume of dry
gas at 0° and 760 mm.?</p>

<p>The pressure of aqueous vapour corresponding to 15·3° is equal to 12·9 mm., and
therefore the volume of dry gas at 15·3° and 747·3 mm. is equal to 37·5 ×

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">747·3 - 12·9</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">747·3</span>
</span>;

at 760 mm. it will be equal to 37·5 ×

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">734·4</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">760</span>
</span>;

and at 0° the volume of dry gas will be
37·5 ×

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">734·4</span>

<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">273 + 15·3</span>
</span>

= 34·31 c.c.</p>

<p>From this rule may also be calculated what fraction of a volume of gas is occupied by
moisture under the ordinary pressure at different temperatures; for instance, at 30° C.
<i>f</i> = 31·5, consequently 100 volumes of a moist gas or air, at 760 mm., contain a volume of
aqueous vapour 100 ×

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">31·5</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">760</span>
</span>,

or 4·110; it is also found that at 0° there is contained
0·61 p.c. by volume, at 10° 1·21 p.c., at 20° 2·29 p.c., and at 50° up to 12·11 p.c. From
this it may be judged how great an error might be made in the measurement of gases
by volume if the moisture were not taken into consideration. From this it is also
evident how great are the variations in volume of the atmosphere when it loses or gains
aqueous vapour, which again explains a number of atmospheric phenomena (winds,
variation of pressure, rainfalls, storms, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>If a gas is not saturated, then it is indispensable that the degree of moisture should
be known in order to determine the volume of dry gas from the volume of moist gas.
The preceding ratio gives the maximum quantity of water which can be held in a gas,
and the degree of moisture shows what fraction of this maximum quantity occurs in a
given case, when the vapour does not saturate the space occupied by the gas. Consequently,
if the degree of moisture equals 50 p.c.&mdash;that is, half the maximum&mdash;then the
volume of dry gas at 760 mm. is equal to the volume of dry gas at 760 mm. multiplied by

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>h</i> - 0·5<i>f</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">760</span>

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>h</i> - <i>rf</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">760</span>
</span>

where <i>r</i> is the degree of moisture. Thus, if it is
required to measure the volume of a moist gas, it must either be thoroughly dried or
quite saturated with moisture, or else the degree of moisture determined. The first and
last methods are inconvenient, and therefore recourse is usually had to the second. For
this purpose water is introduced into the cylinder holding the gas to be measured; it is
left for a certain time so that the gas may become saturated, the precaution being taken
that a portion of the water remains in a liquid state; then the volume of the moist gas
is determined, from which that of the dry gas may be calculated. In order to find the
<i>weight of the aqueous vapour</i> in a gas it is necessary to know the weight of a cubic
measure at 0° and 760 mm. Knowing that one cubic centimetre of air in these circumstances
weighs 0·001293 gram, and that the density of aqueous vapour is 0·62, we find
that one cubic centimetre of aqueous vapour at 0° and 760 mm. weighs 0·0008 gram,
and at a temperature <i>t</i>° and pressure <i>h</i> the weight of one cubic centimetre will be
0·0008 ×

<span class="fup"><i>v</i> × <i>f</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>h</i></span>

volumes of aqueous vapour which saturate it, therefore the
weight of the aqueous vapour held in <i>v</i> volumes of a gas will be</p>

<p>Accordingly, the weight of water which is contained in one volume of a gas depends
only on the temperature and not on the pressure. This also signifies that evaporation
proceeds to the same extent in air as in a vacuum, or, in general terms (this is
<i>Dalton's law</i>), vapours and gases diffuse into each other as if into a vacuum. In a given
space, at a given temperature, a constant quantity of vapour enters, whatever be the
pressure of the gas filling that space.</p>

<p>From this it is clear that if the weight of the vapour contained in a given volume
of a gas be known, it is easy to determine the degree of moisture

On the is founded the very exact determination of the degree of moisture of
air by the weight of water contained in a given volume. It is easy to calculate from
the preceding formula the number of grams of water contained at any pressure in one
cubic metre or million cubic centimetres of air saturated with vapour at various temperatures;
for instance, at 30° <i>f</i> = 31·5, hence <i>p</i> = 29·84 grams.</p>

<p>The laws of Mariotte, Dalton, and Gay-Lussac, which are here applied to gases and
vapours, are not entirely exact, but are approximately true. If they were quite exact,
a mixture of several liquids, having a certain vapour pressure, would give vapours of a
very high pressure, which is not the case. In fact the pressure of aqueous vapour is
slightly less in a gas than in a vacuum, and the weight of aqueous vapour held in a gas
is slightly less than it should be according to Dalton's law, as was shown by the experiments
of Regnault and others. This means that the tension of the vapour is less in air
than in a vacuum. The difference does not, however, exceed 5 per cent. of the total
pressure of the vapours. This <i>decrement in vapour tension</i> which occurs in the intermixture
of vapours and gases, although small, indicates that there is then already, so to
speak, a beginning of chemical change. The essence of the matter is that in this case
there occurs, as on contact (see preceding footnote), an alteration in the motions of the
atoms in the molecules, and therefore also a change in the motion of the molecules
themselves.</p>

<p>In the uniform intermixture of air and other gases with aqueous vapour, and in the
capacity of water to pass into vapour and form a uniform mixture with air, we may
perceive an instance of a physical phenomenon which is analogous to chemical phenomena,
forming indeed a transition from one class of phenomena to the other. Between
water and dry air there exists a kind of affinity which obliges the water to saturate the
air. But such a homogeneous mixture is formed (almost) independently of the nature of
the gas in which evaporation takes place; even in a vacuum the phenomenon occurs in
exactly the same way as in a gas, and therefore it is not the property of the gas, nor its
relation to water, but the property of the water itself, which compels it to evaporate, and
therefore in this case chemical affinity is not yet operative&mdash;at least its action is not
clearly pronounced. That it does, however, play a certain part is seen from the deviation
from Dalton's law.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_48" id="Footnote_2_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_48"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In falling through the atmosphere, water dissolves the gases of the atmosphere,
nitric acid, ammonia, organic compounds, salts of sodium, magnesium, and calcium, and
mechanically washes out a mixture of dust and microbes which are suspended in the
atmosphere. The amount of these and certain other constituents is very variable. Even
in the beginning and end of the same rainfall a variation which is often very considerable
may be remarked. Thus, for example, Bunsen found that rain collected at the beginning
of a shower contained 3·7 grams of ammonia per cubic metre, whilst that collected at the
end of the same shower contained only O·64 gram. The water of the entire shower contained
an average of 1·47 gram of ammonia per cubic metre. In the course of a year
rain supplies an acre of ground with as much as 5&frac12; kilos of nitrogen in a combined form.
Marchand found in one cubic metre of snow water 15·63, and in one cubic metre of rain
water 10·07, grams of sodium sulphate. Angus Smith showed that after a thirty hours'
fall at Manchester the rain still contained 34·3 grams of salts per cubic metre. A considerable
amount of organic matter, namely 25 grams per cubic metre, has been found
in rain water. The total amount of solid matter in rain water reaches 50 grams per
cubic metre. Rain water generally contains very little carbonic acid, whilst river
water contains a considerable quantity of it. In considering the nourishment of
plants it is necessary to keep in view the substances which are carried into the soil
by rain.</p>

<p><i>River water</i>, which is accumulated from springs and sources fed by atmospheric
water, contains from 50 to 1,600 parts by weight of salts in 1,000,000 parts. The amount
of solid matter, per 1,000,000 parts by weight, contained in the chief rivers is as
follows:&mdash;the Don 124, the Loire 135, the St. Lawrence 170, the Rhone 182, the Dnieper
187, the Danube from 117 to 234, the Rhine from 158 to 317, the Seine from 190 to 432,
the Thames at London from 400 to 450, in its upper parts 387, and in its lower parts up
to 1,617, the Nile 1,580, the Jordan 1,052. The Neva is characterised by the remarkably
small amount of solid matter it contains. From the investigations of Prof. G. K. Trapp,
a cubic metre of Neva water contains 32 grams of incombustible and 23 grams of
organic matter, or altogether about 55 grams. This is one of the purest waters which is
known in rivers. The large amount of impurities in river water, and especially of organic
impurity produced by pollution with putrid matter, makes the water of many rivers unfit
for use.</p>

<p>The chief part of the soluble substances in river water consists of the calcium salts.
100 parts of the solid residues contain the following amounts of calcium carbonate&mdash;from
the water of the Loire 53, from the Thames about 50, the Elbe 55, the Vistula 65,
the Danube 65, the Rhine from 55 to 75, the Seine 75, the Rhone from 82 to 94. The
Neva contains 40 parts of calcium carbonate per 100 parts of saline matter. The considerable
amount of calcium carbonate which river water contains is very easily explained
from the fact that water which contains carbonic acid in solution easily dissolves calcium
carbonate, which occurs all over the earth. Besides calcium carbonate and sulphate,
river water contains magnesium, silica, chlorine, sodium, potassium, aluminium, nitric acid,
iron and manganese. The presence of salts of phosphoric acid has not yet been determined
with exactitude for all rivers, but the presence of nitrates has been proved with certainty
in almost all kinds of well-investigated river water. The quantity of calcium phosphate
does not exceed 0·4 gram in the water of the Dnieper, and the Don does not contain more
than 5 grams. The water of the Seine contains about 15 grams of nitrates, and that of the
Rhone about 8 grams. The amount of ammonia is much less; thus in the water of the
Rhine about 0·5 gram in June, and 0·2 gram in October; the water of the Seine contains
the same amount. This is less than in rain water. Notwithstanding this insignificant
quantity, the water of the Rhine alone, which is not so very large a river, carries 16,245
kilograms of ammonia into the ocean every day. The difference between the amount of
ammonia in rain and river water depends on the fact that the soil through which the
rain water passes is able to retain the ammonia. (Soil can also absorb many other substances,
such as phosphoric acid, potassium salts, &amp;c.)</p>

<p>The waters of springs, rivers, wells, and in general of those localities from which it is
taken for drinking purposes, may be injurious to health if it contains much organic
pollution, the more so as in such water the lower organisms (bacteria) may rapidly
develop, and these organisms often serve as the carriers or causes of infectious diseases.
For instance, certain pathogenic (disease-producing) bacteria are known to produce
typhoid, the Siberian plague, and cholera. Thanks to the work of Pasteur, Metchnikoff,
Koch, and many others, this province of research has made considerable progress. It is
possible to investigate the number and properties of the germs in water. In bacteriological
researches a gelatinous medium in which the germs can develop and multiply is
prepared with gelatin and water, which has previously been heated several times, at
intervals, to 100° (it is thus rendered sterile&mdash;that is to say, all the germs in it are killed).
The water to be investigated is added to this prepared medium in a definite and small
quantity (sometimes diluted with sterilised water to facilitate the calculation of the
number of germs), it is protected from dust (which contains germs), and is left at rest
until whole families of lower organisms are developed from each germ. These families
(colonies) are visible to the naked eye (as spots), they may be counted, and by examining
them under the microscope and observing the number of organisms they produce, their
significance may be determined. The majority of bacteria are harmless, but there are
decidedly pathogenic bacteria, whose presence is one of the causes of malady and of the
spread of certain diseases. The number of bacteria in one cubic centimetre of water
sometimes attains the immense figures of hundreds of thousands and millions. Certain
well, spring, and river waters contain very few bacteria, and are free from disease-producing
bacteria under ordinary circumstances. By boiling water, the bacteria in it
are killed, but the organic matter necessary for their nourishment remains in the water.
The best kinds of water for drinking purposes do not contain more than 300 bacteria in
a cubic centimetre.</p>

<p>The amount of gases dissolved in river water is much more constant than that of its
solid constituents. One litre, or 1,000 c.c., of water contains 40 to 55 c.c. of gas measured
at normal temperature and pressure. In winter the amount of gas is greater than in
summer or autumn. Assuming that a litre contains 50 c.c. of gases, it may be admitted
that these consist, on an average, of 20 vols. of nitrogen, 20 vols of carbonic anhydride
(proceeding in all likelihood from the soil and not from the atmosphere), and of 10 vols.
of oxygen. If the total amount of gases be less, the constituent gases are still in about
the same proportion; in many cases, however, carbonic anhydride predominates. The
water of many deep and rapid rivers contains less carbonic anhydride, which shows their
rapid formation from atmospheric water, and that they have not succeeded, during a long
and slow course, in absorbing a greater quantity of carbonic anhydride. Thus, for
instance, the water of the Rhine, near Strasburg, according to Deville, contains 8 c.c.
of carbonic anhydride, 16 c.c. of nitrogen, and 7 c.c. of oxygen per litre. From the
researches of Prof. M. R. Kapoustin and his pupils, it appears that in determining the
quality of a water for drinking purposes, it is most important to investigate the composition
of the dissolved gases, more especially oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_49" id="Footnote_3_49"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_49"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> <i>Spring water</i> is formed from rain water percolating through the soil. Naturally a
part of the rain water is evaporated directly from the surface of the earth and from the
vegetation on it. It has been shown that out of 100 parts of water falling on the earth
only 36 parts flow to the ocean; the remaining 64 are evaporated, or percolate far underground.
After flowing underground along some impervious strata, water comes out at
the surface in many places as springs, whose temperature is determined by the depth
from which the water has flowed. Springs penetrating to a great depth may become
considerably heated, and this is why hot mineral springs, with a temperature of up to
30° and higher, are often met with. When a spring water contains substances which
endow it with a peculiar taste, and especially if these substances are such as are only
found in minute quantities in river and other flowing waters, then the spring water is
termed a <i>mineral water</i>. Many such waters are employed for medicinal purposes.
Mineral waters are classed according to their composition into&mdash;(<i>a</i>) saline waters, which
often contain a large amount of common salt; (<i>b</i>) alkaline waters, which contain sodium
carbonate; (<i>c</i>) bitter waters, which contain magnesia; (<i>d</i>) chalybeate waters, which hold
iron carbonate in solution; (<i>e</i>) aërated waters, which are rich in carbonic anhydride;
(<i>f</i>) sulphuretted waters, which contain hydrogen sulphide. Sulphuretted waters may be
recognised by their smell of rotten eggs, and by their giving a black precipitate with lead
salts, and also by their tarnishing silver objects. Aërated waters, which contain an
excess of carbonic anhydride, effervesce in the air, have a sharp taste, and redden litmus
paper. Saline waters leave a large residue of soluble solid matter on evaporation, and
have a salt taste. Chalybeate waters have an inky taste, and are coloured black by an
infusion of galls; on being exposed to the air they usually give a brown precipitate.
Generally, the character of mineral waters is mixed. In the table below the analyses
are given of certain mineral springs which are valued for their medicinal properties.
The quantity of the substances is expressed in millionths by weight.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_50" id="Footnote_4_50"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_50"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> <i>Sea water</i> contains more non-volatile saline constituents than the usual kinds of
fresh water. This is explained by the fact that the waters flowing into the sea supply
it with salts, and whilst a large quantity of vapour is given off from the surface of the
sea, the salts remain behind. Even the specific gravity of sea water differs considerably
from that of pure water. It is generally about 1·02, but in this and also in respect of
the amount of salts contained, samples of sea water from different localities and from
different depths offer rather remarkable variations. It will be sufficient to point out
that one cubic metre of water from the undermentioned localities contains the following
quantity in grams of solid constituents:&mdash;Gulf of Venice, 19,122; Leghorn Harbour
24,312; Mediterranean, near Cetta, 37,665; the Atlantic Ocean from 32,585 to 35,695,; the
Pacific Ocean from 35,233 to 34,708. In closed seas which do not communicate, or are
in very distant communication, with the ocean, the difference is often still greater. Thus
the Caspian Sea contains 6,300 grams; the Black Sea and Baltic 17,700. Common salt
forms the chief constituent of the saline matter of sea or ocean water; thus in one cubic
metre of sea water there are 25,000&ndash;31,000 grams of common salt, 2,600&ndash;6,000 grams of
magnesium chloride, 1,200&ndash;7,000 grams of magnesium sulphate, 1,500&ndash;6,000 grams of
calcium sulphate, and 10&ndash;700 grams of potassium chloride. The small amount of organic
matter and of the salts of phosphoric acid in sea water is very remarkable. Sea water
(the composition of which is partially discussed in Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>.) contains, in addition to
salts of common occurrence, a certain and sometimes minute amount of the most varied
elements, even gold and silver, and as the mass of water of the oceans is so enormous
these &lsquo;traces&rsquo; of rare substances amount to large quantities, so that it may be hoped that
in time methods will be found to extract even gold from sea water, which by means of the
rivers forms a vast reservoir for the numerous products of the changes taking place on
the earth's surface. The works of English, American, German, Russian, Swedish, and
other navigators and observers prove that a study of the composition of sea water not
only explains much in the history of the earth's life, but also gives the possibility (especially
since the researches of C. O. Makaroff of the St. Petersburg Academy) of fixing one's
position in the ocean in the absence of other means, for instance, in a fog, or in the dark.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_51" id="Footnote_5_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_51"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The taste of water is greatly dependent on the quantity of dissolved gases it contains.
These gases are given off on boiling, and it is well known that, even when cooled,
boiled water has, until it has absorbed gaseous substances from the atmosphere, quite a
different taste from fresh water containing a considerable amount of gas. The dissolved
gases, especially oxygen and carbonic anhydride, have an important influence on the
health. The following instance is very instructive in this respect. The Grenelle artesian
well at Paris, when first opened, supplied a water which had an injurious effect on men
and animals. It appeared that this water did not contain oxygen, and was in general
very poor in gases. As soon as it was made to fall in a cascade, by which it absorbed air,
it proved quite fit for consumption. In long sea voyages fresh water is sometimes not
taken at all, or only taken in a small quantity, because it spoils by keeping, and becomes
putrid from the organic matter it contains undergoing decomposition. Fresh water may
he obtained directly from sea-water by distillation. The distilled water no longer contains
sea salts, and is therefore fit for consumption, but it is very tasteless and has the properties
of boiled water. In order to render it palatable certain salts, which are usually held
in fresh water, are added to it, and it is made to flow in thin streams exposed to the air
in order that it may become saturated with the component parts of the atmosphere&mdash;that
is, absorb gases.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_52" id="Footnote_6_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_52"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> <i>Hard water</i> is such as contains much mineral matter, and especially a large proportion
of calcium salts. Such water, owing to the amount of lime it contains, does not
form a lather with soap, prevents vegetables boiled in it from softening properly, and
forms a large amount of incrustation on vessels in which it is boiled. When of a high
degree of hardness, it is injurious for drinking purposes, which is evident from the fact
that in several large cities the death-rate has been found to decrease after introducing a
soft water in the place of a hard water. <i>Putrid water</i> contains a considerable quantity
of decomposing organic matter, chiefly vegetable, but in populated districts, especially in
towns, chiefly animal remains. Such water acquires an unpleasant smell and taste, by
which stagnant bog water and the water of certain wells in inhabited districts are particularly
characterised. Water of this kind is especially injurious at a period of epidemic.
It may be partially purified by being passed through charcoal, which retains the putrid
and certain organic substances, and also certain mineral substances. Turbid water may
be purified to a certain extent by the addition of alum, which aids, after standing some
time, the formation of a sediment. Condy's fluid (potassium permanganate) is another
means of purifying putrid water. A solution of this substance, even if very dilute, is of
a red colour; on adding it to a putrid water, the permanganate oxidises and destroys the
organic matter. When added to water in such a quantity as to impart to it an almost
imperceptible rose colour it destroys much of the organic substances it contains. It is
especially salutary to add a small quantity of Condy's fluid to impure water in times of
epidemic.</p>

<p>The presence in water of one gram per litre, or 1,000 grams per cubic metre, of any
substance whatsoever, renders it unfit and even injurious for consumption by animals,
and this whether organic or mineral matter predominates. The presence of 1 p.c. of
chlorides makes water quite salt, and produces thirst instead of assuaging it. The
presence of magnesium salts is most unpleasant; they have a disagreeable bitter taste,
and, in fact, impart to sea water its peculiar taste. A large amount of nitrates is only
found in impure water, and is usually injurious, as they may indicate the presence of
decomposing organic matter.</p></div>

<p>If the temperature be determined by the hydrogen thermometer, whose indications
between 0° and 100° are slightly lower than the mercurial (for example, about 0·1° C. at
20°), then a slightly smaller sp. gr. will be obtained for a given <i>t</i>. Thus Chappuis (1892)
obtained 0·998233 for 20°. Water at 4° is taken as the basis for reducing measures of
length to measures of weight and volume. The <i>metric, decimal, system</i> of measures of
weights and volumes is generally employed in science. The starting point of this system
is the metre (39·37 inches) divided into decimetres (= 0·1 metre), centimetres (= 0·01 metre),
millimetres (= 0·001 metre), and micrometres (= one millionth of a metre). A cubic
decimetre is called a <i>litre</i>, and is used for the measurement of volumes. The weight of
a litre of water at 4° in a vacuum is called a kilogram. One thousandth part of a kilogram
of water weighs one <i>gram</i>. It is divided into decigrams, centigrams, and milligrams
(= 0·001 gram). An English pound equals 453·59 grams. The great advantage of
this system is that it is a decimal one, and that it is universally adopted in science and in
most international relations. <i>All the measures cited in this work are metrical.</i> The
units most often used in science are:&mdash;Of length, the centimetre; of weight, the gram;
of time, the second; of temperature, the degree Celsius or Centigrade. According to
the most trustworthy determinations (Kupfer in Russia 1841, and Chaney in England
1892), the weight of a c. dcm. of water at 4° in vacuo is about 999·9 grms. For ordinary
purposes the weight of a c. dcg. may be taken as equal to a kg. Hence the litre (determined
by the weight of water it holds) is slightly greater than a cubic decimetre.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_57" id="Footnote_11_57"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_57"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Of all known liquids, water exhibits the greatest <i>cohesion</i> of particles. Indeed, it
ascends to a greater height in capillary tubes than other liquids; for instance, two and a
half times as high as alcohol, nearly three times as high as ether, and to a much greater
height than oil of vitriol, &amp;c. In a tube one mm. in diameter, water at 0° ascends 15·3 mm.,
measuring from the height of the liquid to two-thirds of the height of the meniscus, and
at 100° it rises 12·5 mm. The cohesion varies very uniformly with the temperature; thus
at 50° the height of the capillary column equals 13·9 mm.&mdash;that is, the mean between the
columns at 0° and 100°. This uniformity is not destroyed even at temperatures near
the freezing point, and hence it may be assumed that at high temperatures cohesion will
vary as uniformly as at ordinary temperatures; that is, the difference between the columns
at 0° and 100° being 2·8 mm., the height of the column at 500° should be 15·2 - (5 × 2·8) =
1·2 mm.; or, in other words, at these high temperatures the cohesion between the particles
of water would he almost <i>nil</i>. Only certain solutions (sal ammoniac and lithium chloride),
and these only with a great excess of water, rise higher than pure water in
capillary tubes. The great cohesion of water doubtless determines many of both its
physical and chemical properties.</p>

<p>The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of one part by weight of water
from 0° to 1°, <i>i.e.</i> by 1° C., is called the <i>unit of heat</i> or calorie; the <i>specific heat of
liquid water</i> at 0° is taken as equal to unity. The variation of this specific heat with a
rise in temperature is inconsiderable in comparison with the variation exhibited by the
specific heats of other liquids. According to Ettinger, the specific heat of water at 20°
= 1·016, at 50° = 1·039, and at 100° = 1·073. The specific heat of water is greater than
that of any other known liquid; for example, the specific heat of alcohol at 0° is 0·55&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the quantity of heat which raises 55 parts of water 1° raises 100 parts of alcohol 1°.
The specific heat of oil of turpentine at 0° is 0·41, of ether 0·53, of acetic acid 0·5274, of
mercury 0·033. Hence water is the best condenser or absorber of heat. This property
of water has an important significance in practice and in nature. Water prevents rapid
cooling or heating, and thus tempers cold and heat. The specific heats of ice and
aqueous vapour are much less than that of water; namely, that of ice is 0·504, and
of steam 0·48.</p>

<p>With an increase in pressure equal to one atmosphere, the compressibility of water
(<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_9_55">9</a>) is 0·000047, of mercury 0·00000352, of ether 0·00012 at 0°, of alcohol at 13°
0·000095. The addition of various substances to water generally decreases both its
compressibility and cohesion. The compressibility of other liquids increases with a rise
of temperature, but for water it decreases up to 53° and then increases like other liquids.</p>

<p>The <i>expansion of water</i> by heat (Note <a href="#Footnote_9_55">9</a>) also exhibits many peculiarities which are
not found in other liquids. The expansion of water at low temperatures is very small
compared with other liquids; at 4° it is almost zero, and at 100° it is equal to 0·0008;
below 4° it is negative&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> water on cooling then expands, and does not decrease in
volume. In passing into a solid state, the specific gravity of water decreases; at 0° one
c.c. of water weighs 0·999887 gram, and one c.c. of ice at the same temperature weighs
only 0·9175 gram. The ice formed, however, contracts on cooling like the majority of
other substances. Thus 100 volumes of ice are produced from 92 volumes of water&mdash;that
is, water expands considerably on freezing, which fact determines a number of natural
phenomena. The freezing point of water falls with an increase in pressure (0·007° per
atmosphere), because in freezing water expands (Thomson), whilst with substances which
contract in solidifying the melting point rises with an increase in pressure; thus, paraffin
under one atmosphere melts at 46°, and under 100 atmospheres at 49°.</p>

<p>When liquid water passes into vapour, the cohesion of its particles must be destroyed,
as the particles are removed to such a distance from each other that their mutual
attraction no longer exhibits any influence. As the cohesion of aqueous particles varies
at different temperatures, the quantity of heat which is expended in overcoming this
cohesion&mdash;or the <i>latent heat of evaporation</i>&mdash;will for this reason alone be different at
different temperatures. The quantity of heat which is consumed in the transformation
of one part by weight of water, at different temperatures, into vapour was determined by
Regnault with great accuracy. His researches showed that one part by weight of water
at 0°, in passing into vapour having a temperature <i>t</i>°, consumes 606·5 + 0·305<i>t</i> units of
heat, at 50° 621·7, at 100° 637·0, at 150° 652·2, and at 200° 667·5. But this quantity
includes also the quantity of heat required for heating the water from 0° to <i>t</i>°&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
besides the latent heat of evaporation, also that heat which is used in heating the water
in a liquid state to a temperature <i>t</i>°. On deducting this amount of heat, we obtain the
latent heat of evaporation of water as 606·5 at 0°, 571 at 50°, 534 at 100°, 494 at 150°, and
only 453 at 200°, which shows that the conversion of water at different temperatures into
vapour at a constant temperature requires very different quantities of heat. This is
chiefly dependent on the difference of the cohesion of water at different temperatures;
the cohesion is greater at low than at high temperatures, and therefore at low temperatures
a greater quantity of heat is required to overcome the cohesion. On comparing
these quantities of heat, it will be observed that they decrease rather uniformly, namely
their difference between 0° and 100° is 72, and between 100° and 200° is 81 units of heat.
From this we may conclude that this variation will be approximately the same for high
temperatures also, and therefore that no heat would be required for the conversion
of water into vapour at a temperature of about 400°. At this temperature, water
passes into vapour whatever be the pressure (see Chap. <a href="#Page_113">II</a>. The absolute boiling point
of water, according to Dewar, is 370°, the critical pressure 196 atmospheres). It must
here be remarked that water, in presenting a greater cohesion, requires a larger quantity
of heat for its conversion into vapour than other liquids. Thus alcohol consumes 208,
ether 90, turpentine 70, units of heat in their conversion into vapour.</p>

<p>The whole amount of heat which is consumed in the conversion of water into vapour
is not used in overcoming the cohesion&mdash;that is, in internal accomplished in the
liquid. A part of this heat is employed in moving the aqueous particles; in fact,
aqueous vapour at 100° occupies a volume 1,659 times greater than that of water (at the
ordinary pressure), consequently a portion of the heat or work is employed in lifting the
aqueous particles, in overcoming pressure, or in external work, which may be usefully
employed, and which is so employed in steam engines. In order to determine this work,
let us consider the variation of the maximum <i>pressure</i> or <i>vapour tension of steam</i> at
different temperatures. The observations of Regnault in this respect, as on those preceding,
deserve special attention from their comprehensiveness and accuracy. The
pressure or tension of aqueous vapour at various temperatures is given in the adjoining
table, and is expressed in millimetres of the barometric column reduced to 0°.</p>

<p>The table shows the boiling points of water at different pressures. Thus on the
summit of Mont Blanc, where the average pressure is about 424 mm., water boils at
84·4°. In a rarefied atmosphere water boils even at the ordinary temperature, but in
evaporating it absorbs heat from the neighbouring parts, and therefore it becomes cold
and may even freeze if the pressure does not exceed 4·6 mm., and especially if the vapour
be rapidly absorbed as it is formed. Oil of vitriol, which absorbs the aqueous vapour, is
used for this purpose. Thus ice may be obtained artificially at the ordinary temperature
with the aid of an air-pump. This table of the tension of aqueous vapour also shows the
temperature of water contained in a closed boiler if the pressure of the steam formed be
known. Thus at a pressure of five atmospheres (a pressure of five times the ordinary
atmospheric pressure&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> 5 × 760 = 3,800 mm.) the temperature of the water would be
152°. The table also shows the pressure produced on a given surface by steam on issuing
from a boiler. Thus steam having a temperature of 152° exerts a pressure of 517 kilos
on a piston whose surface equals 100 sq. cm., for the pressure of one atmosphere on one
sq. cm. equals 1,033 kilos, and steam at 152° has a pressure of five atmospheres. As
a column of mercury 1 mm. high exerts a pressure of 1·35959 grams on a surface of
1 sq. cm., therefore the pressure of aqueous vapour at 0° corresponds with a pressure of
6·25 grams per square centimetre. The pressures for all temperatures may be calculated
in a similar way, and it will be found that at 100° it is equal to 1,033·28 grams. This
means that if a cylinder be taken whose sectional area equals 1 sq. cm., and if water be
poured into it and it be closed by a piston weighing 1,033 grams, then on heating it in a
vacuum to 100° no steam will be formed, because the steam cannot overcome the pressure
of the piston; and if at 100° 534 units of heat be transmitted to each unit of weight
of water, then the whole of the water will be converted into vapour having the same
temperature; and so also for every other temperature. The question now arises, to
what height does the piston rise under these circumstances? that is, in other words, What
is the volume occupied by the steam under a known pressure? For this we must know
the weight of a cubic centimetre of steam at various temperatures. It has been shown
by experiment that the density of steam, which does not saturate a space, varies very
inconsiderably at all possible pressures, and is nine times the density of hydrogen under
similar conditions. Steam which saturates a space varies in density at different temperatures,
but this difference is very small, and its average density with reference to air
is 0·64. We will employ this number in our calculation, and will calculate what volume
the steam occupies at 100°. One cubic centimetre of air at 0° and 760 mm. weighs
0·001293 gram, at 100° and under the same pressure it will weigh

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">0·001293</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">1·368</span>
</span>

or about
0·000946 gram, and consequently one cubic centimetre of steam whose density is 0·64
will weigh 0·000605 gram at 100°, and therefore one gram of aqueous vapour will occupy
a volume of about 1·653 c.c. Consequently, the piston in the cylinder of 1 sq. cm. sectional
area, and in which the water occupied a height of 1 cm., will be raised 1,653 cm.
on the conversion of this water into steam. This piston, as has been mentioned, weighs
1,033 grams, therefore the <i>external work of the steam</i>&mdash;that is, that work which the
water does in its conversion into steam at 100°&mdash;is equal to lifting a piston weighing
1,033 grams to a height of 1,653 cm., or 17·07 kilogram-metres of work&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> is capable of
lifting 17 kilograms 1 metre, or 1 kilogram 17 metres. One gram of water requires for
its conversion into steam 534 gram units of heat or 0·534 kilogram unit of heat&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the
quantity of heat absorbed in the evaporation of one gram of water is equal to the quantity
of heat which is capable of heating 1 kilogram of water 0·534°. Each unit of heat,
as has been shown by accurate experiment, is capable of doing 424 kilogram-metres of
work. Hence, in evaporating, one gram of water expends 424 × 0·534 = (almost) 227
kilogram-metres of work. The external work was found to be only 17 kilogram-metres,
therefore 210 kilogram-metres are expended in overcoming the internal cohesion of the
aqueous particles, and consequently about 92 p.c. of the total heat or work is consumed
in overcoming the internal cohesion. The following figures are thus calculated approximately:&mdash;</p>

<p>The work necessary for overcoming the internal cohesion of water in its passage into
vapour decreases with the rise in temperature&mdash;that is, corresponds with the decrease of
cohesion; and, in fact, the variations which take place in this case are very similar to
those which are observed in the heights to which water rises in capillary tubes at
different temperatures. It is evident, therefore, that the amount of external&mdash;or, as it is
termed, useful&mdash;work which water can supply by its evaporation is very small compared
with the amount which it expends in its conversion into vapour.</p>

<p>In considering certain physico-mechanical properties of water, I had in view not only
their importance for theory and practice, but also their purely chemical significance; for
it is evident from the above considerations that even in a physical change of state the
greatest part of the work done is employed in overcoming cohesion, and that an enormous
amount of internal energy must be expended in overcoming chemical cohesion or
affinity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_58" id="Footnote_12_58"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_58"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> When it is necessary to heat a considerable mass of liquid in different vessels, it
would be very uneconomical to make use of metallic vessels and to construct a separate
furnace for each; such cases are continually met with in practice. Steam from a boiler
is introduced into the liquid, or, in general, into the vessel which it is required to heat.
The steam, in condensing and passing into a liquid state, parts with its latent heat, and
as this is very considerable a small quantity of steam will produce a considerable heating
effect. If it be required, for instance, to heat 1,000 kilos of water from 20° to 50°, which
requires approximately 30,000 units of heat, steam at 100° is passed into the water
from a boiler. Each kilogram of water at 50° contains about 50 units of heat, and each
kilogram of steam at 100° contains 637 units of heat; therefore, each kilogram of steam
in cooling to 50° gives up 587 units of heat, and consequently 52 kilos of steam are
capable of heating 1,000 kilos of water from 20° to 50°. Water is very often applied for
heating in chemical practice. For this purpose metallic vessels or pans, called &lsquo;water-baths,&rsquo;
are made use of. They are closed by a cover formed of concentric rings lying on
each other. The vessels&mdash;such as beakers, evaporating basins, retorts, &amp;c.&mdash;containing
liquids, are placed on these rings, and the water in the bath is heated. The steam given
off heats the bottom of the vessels to be heated, and thus effects the evaporation or
distillation.</p></div>

is placed on the gauze inside the oven. The thermometer indicates the temperature.</p></div>

<p>In order to dry any substance at about 100°&mdash;that is, at the boiling point of water
(hygroscopic water passes off at this temperature)&mdash;an apparatus called a &lsquo;drying-oven&rsquo;
is employed. It consists of a double copper box; water is poured into the space
between the internal and external boxes, and the oven is then heated over a stove or by
any other means, or else steam from a boiler is passed between the walls of the two
boxes. When the water boils, the temperature inside the inner box will be approximately
100° C. The substance to be dried is placed inside the oven, and the door is closed.
Several holes are cut in the door to allow the free passage of air, which carries off the
aqueous vapour by the chimney on the top of the oven. Often, however, desiccation is
carried on in copper ovens heated directly over a lamp (fig. <a href="#fig_13">13</a>). In this case any desired
temperature may be obtained, which is determined by a thermometer fixed in a special
orifice. There are substances which only part with their water at a much higher
temperature than 100°, and then such air baths are very useful. In order to determine
directly the amount of water in a substance which does not part with anything except
water at a red heat, the substance is placed in a bulb tube. By first weighing the tube
empty and then with the substance to be dried in it, the weight of the substance taken may
be found. The tube is then connected on one side with a gas-holder full of air, which, on
opening a stop-cock, passes first through a flask containing sulphuric acid, and then into
a vessel containing lumps of pumice stone moistened with sulphuric acid. In passing
through these vessels the air is thoroughly dried, having given up all its moisture to the
sulphuric acid. Thus dry air will pass into the bulb tube, and as hygroscopic water is
entirely given up from a substance in dry air even at the ordinary temperature, and still
more rapidly on heating, the moisture given up by the substance in the tube will be
carried off by the air passing through it. This damp air then passes through a U-shaped
tube full of pieces of pumice stone moistened with sulphuric acid, which absorbs all the
moisture given off from the substance in the bulb tube. Thus all the water expelled
from the substance will collect in the U tube, and so, if this be weighed before and after,
the difference will show the quantity of water expelled from the substance. If only water
(and not any gases) come over, the increase of the weight of the U tube will be equal to
the decrease in the weight of the bulb tube.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_60" id="Footnote_14_60"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_60"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Instead of under a glass bell jar, drying over sulphuric acid is often carried on in
a desiccator consisting of a shallow wide-mouthed glass vessel, closed by a well-fitting
ground-glass cover. Sulphuric acid is poured over the bottom of the desiccator, and the
substance to be dried is placed on a glass stand above the acid. A lateral glass tube with
a stop-cock is often fused into the desiccator in order to connect it with an air pump, and
so allow drying under a diminished pressure, when the moisture evaporates more rapidly.
The fact that in the usual form of desiccator the desiccating substance (sulphuric acid)
is placed beneath the substance to be dried has the disadvantage that the moist air being
lighter than dry air distributes itself in the upper portion of the desiccator and not below.
Hempel, in his desiccator (1891), avoids this by placing the absorbent above the substance
to be dried. The process of desiccation can be further accelerated by cooling the upper
portion of the desiccator, and so inducing ascending and descending currents of air within
the apparatus.</p></div>

which pass through a membrane from those
which do not. Description in text.</p></div>

<p>The rate of diffusion&mdash;like the rate of transmission&mdash;through membranes, or <i>dialysis</i>
(which plays an important part in the vital processes of organisms and also in technical
processes), presents, according to Graham's researches, a sharply defined change in
passing from such crystallisable substances as the majority of salts and acids to substances
which are capable of giving jellies (gum, gelatin, &amp;c.) The former diffuse into
solutions and pass through membranes much more rapidly than the latter, and Graham
therefore distinguishes between <i>crystalloids</i>, which diffuse rapidly, and <i>colloids</i>, which
diffuse slowly. On breaking solid colloids into pieces, a total absence of cleavage is
remarked. The fracture of such substances is like that of glue or glass. It is termed a
&lsquo;conchoidal&rsquo; fracture. Almost all the substances of which animal and vegetable bodies
consist are colloids, and this is, at all events, partly the reason why animals and plants
have such varied forms, which have no resemblance to the crystalline forms of the
majority of mineral substances. The colloid solid substances in organisms&mdash;that is, in
animals and plants&mdash;almost always contain water, and take most peculiar forms, of networks,
of granules, of hairs, of mucous, shapeless masses, &amp;c., which are quite different
from the forms taken by crystalline substances. When colloids separate out from solutions,
or from a molten state, they
present a form which is similar to
that of the liquid from which they
were formed. Glass may he taken
as the best example of this. Colloids
are distinguishable from crystalloids,
not only by the absence of
crystalline form, but by many other
properties which admit of clearly
distinguishing both these classes of
solids, as Graham showed. Nearly
all colloids are capable of passing,
under certain circumstances, from
a soluble into an insoluble state.
The best example is shown by white
of eggs (albumin) in the raw and
soluble form, and in the hard-boiled
and insoluble form. The
majority of colloids, on passing into an insoluble form in the presence of water, give
substances having a gelatinous appearance, which is familiar to every one in starch,
solidified glue, jelly, &amp;c. Thus gelatin, or common carpenter's glue, when soaked in
water, swells up into an insoluble jelly. If this jelly be heated, it melts, and is then
soluble in water, but on cooling it again forms a jelly which is insoluble in water. One
of the properties which distinguish colloids from crystalloids is that the former pass very
slowly through a membrane, whilst the latter penetrate very rapidly. This may be shown
by taking a cylinder, open at both ends, and by covering its lower end with a bladder or
with vegetable parchment (unsized paper immersed for two or three minutes in a mixture
of sulphuric acid and half its volume of water, and then washed), or any other membranous
substance (all such substances are themselves colloids in an insoluble form).
The membrane must be firmly tied to the cylinder, so as not to leave any opening.
Such an apparatus is called a <i>dialyser</i> (fig. <a href="#fig_15">15</a>), and the process of separation of crystalloids
from colloids by means of such a membrane is termed <i>dialysis</i>. An aqueous
solution of a crystalloid or colloid, or a mixture of both, is poured into the dialyser,
which is then placed in a vessel containing water, so that the bottom of the membrane
is covered with water. Then, after a certain period of time, the crystalloid passes through
the membrane, whilst the colloid, if it does pass through at all, does so at an incomparably
slower rate. The crystalloid naturally passes through into the water until the solution
attains the same strength on both sides of the membrane. By replacing the outside
water with fresh water, a fresh quantity of the crystalloid may be separated from the
dialyser. While a crystalloid is passing through the membrane, a colloid remains almost
entirely in the dialyser, and therefore a mixed solution of these two kinds of substances
may be separated from each other by a dialyser. The study of the properties of colloids,
and of the phenomena of their passage through membranes, should elucidate much
respecting the phenomena which are accomplished in organisms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_66" id="Footnote_19_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_66"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The formation of solutions may be considered in two aspects, from a physical and
from a chemical point of view, and it is more evident in solutions than in any other
department of chemistry how closely these provinces of natural science are allied
together. On the one hand solutions form a particular case of a physico-mechanical
interpenetration of homogeneous substances, and a juxtaposition of the molecules of the
substance dissolved and of the solvent, similar to the juxtaposition which is exhibited in
homogeneous substances. From this point of view this diffusion of solutions is exactly
similar to the diffusion of gases, with only this difference, that the nature and store of energy
are different in gases from what they are in liquids, and that in liquids there is considerable
friction, whilst in gases there is comparatively little. The penetration of a dissolved
substance into water is likened to evaporation, and solution to the formation of vapour.
This resemblance was clearly expressed even by Graham. In recent years the Dutch
chemist, Van't Hoff, has developed this view of solutions in great detail, having shown
(in a memoir in the <i>Transactions of the Swedish Academy of Science</i>, Part 21, No. 17,
&lsquo;Lois de l'équilibre chimique dans l'état dilué, gazeux ou dissous,&rsquo; 1886), that for dilute
solutions the <i>osmotic pressure</i> follows the same laws of Boyle, Mariotte, Gay-Lussac,
and Avogadro-Gerhardt as for gases. The osmotic pressure of a substance dissolved in
water is determined by means of membranes which allow the passage of water, but not
of a substance dissolved in it, through them. This property is found in animal protoplasmic
membranes and in porous substances covered with an amorphous precipitate,
such as is obtained by the action of copper sulphate on potassium ferrocyanide (Pfeffer,
Traube). If, for instance, a one p.c. solution of sugar he placed in such a vessel, which
is then closed and placed in water, the water passes through the walls of the vessel and
increases the pressure by 50 mm. of the barometric column. If the pressure be artificially
increased inside the vessel, then the water will be expelled through the walls. De Vries
found a convenient means of determining <i>isotonic</i> solutions (those presenting a similar
osmotic pressure) in the cells of plants. For this purpose a portion of the soft part of
the leaves of the <i>Tradescantis discolor</i>, for instance, is cut away and moistened with the
solution of a given salt and of a given strength. If the osmotic pressure of the solution
taken be less than that of the sap contained in the cells they will change their form or
shrink; if, on the other hand, the osmotic pressure be greater than that of the sap, then
the cells will expand, as can easily be seen under the microscope. By altering the
amount of the different salts in solution it is possible to find for each salt the strength
of solution at which the cells begin to swell, and at which they will consequently have
an equal osmotic pressure. As it increases in proportion to the amount of a substance
dissolved per 100 parts of water, it is possible, knowing the osmotic pressure of a given substance&mdash;for
instance, sugar at various degrees of concentration of solution&mdash;and knowing
the composition of isotonic solutions compared with sugar, to determine the osmotic
pressure of all the salts investigated. The osmotic pressure of dilute solutions determined
in this manner directly or indirectly (from observations made by Pfeffer and De Vries)
was shown to follow the same laws as those of the pressure of gases; for instance, by
doubling or increasing the quantity of a salt (in a given volume) <i>n</i> times, the pressure is
doubled or increases <i>n</i> times. So, for example, in a solution containing one part of sugar
per 100 parts of water the osmotic pressure (according to Pfeffer) = 58·5 cm. of mercury,
if 2 parts of sugar = 101·6, if 4 parts = 208·2 and so on, which proves that the ratio is true
within the limits of experimental error. (2) Different substances for equal strengths of
solutions, show very different osmotic pressures, just as gases for equal parts by weight
in equal volumes show different tensions. (3) If, for a given dilute solution at 0°, the
osmotic pressure equal <i>p</i>°, then at <i>t</i>° it will be greater and equal to <i>p</i>°(1 + 0·00367<i>t</i>), <i>i.e.</i>
it increases with the temperature in exactly the same manner as the tension of gases
increases. (4) If in dilute solutions of such substances as do not conduct an electric
current (for instance, sugar, acetone, and many other organic bodies) the substances be
taken in the ratio of their molecular weights (expressed by their formulæ, see Chapter
<a href="#Page_299">VII</a>.), then not only will the osmotic pressure be equal, but its magnitude will be determined
by that tension which would be proper to the vapours of the given substances
when they would be contained in the space occupied by the solution, just as the tension
of the vapours of molecular quantities of the given substances will be equal, and determined
by the laws of Gay-Lussac, Mariotte, and Avogadro-Gerhardt. Those formulæ
(Chapter VII., Notes <a href="#Footnote_23_432">23</a> and <a href="#Footnote_24_433">24</a>) by which the gaseous state of matter is determined, may
also be applied in the present case. So, for example, the osmotic pressure <i>p</i>, in centimetres
of mercury, of a one per cent. solution of sugar, may be calculated according to the
formula for gases:</p>

<p class="center">M<i>p</i> = 6200<i>s</i>(273 + <i>t</i>),</p>

<p class="noindent">where M is the molecular weight, <i>s</i> the weight in grams of a cubic centimetre of vapour,
and <i>t</i> its temperature. For sugar M = 342 (because its molecular composition is
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>). The specific gravity of the solution of sugar is 1·003, hence the weight of
sugar <i>s</i> contained in a 1 per cent. solution = 0·01003 gram. The observation was made
at <i>t</i> = 14°. Hence, according to the formula, we find <i>p</i> = 52·2 centimetres. And experiments
carried on at 14° gave 53·5 centimetres, which is very near to the above. (5) For
the solutions of salts, acids, and similar substances, which conduct an electric current,
the calculated pressure is usually (but not always in a definite or multiple number of
times) less than the observed by <i>i</i> times, and this <i>i</i> for dilute solutions of MgSO<sub>4</sub> is nearly
1, for CO<sub>2</sub> = 1, for KCl, NaCl, KI, KNO<sub>3</sub> greater than 1, and approximates to 2, for
BaCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and others between 2 and 3, for HCl, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, CaN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, and
others nearly 2 and so on. It should be remarked that the above deductions are only
applicable (and with a certain degree of accuracy) to dilute solutions, and in this respect
resemble the generalisations of Michel and Kraft (see Note <a href="#Footnote_44_91">44</a>). Nevertheless, the
arithmetical relation found by Van't Hoff between the formation of vapours and the
transition into dilute solutions forms an important scientific discovery, which should
facilitate the explanation of the nature of solutions, while the osmotic pressure of solutions
already forms a very important aspect of the study of solutions. In this respect it
is necessary to mention that Prof. Konovaloff (1891, and subsequently others also)
discovered the dependence (and it may be a sufficient explanation) of the osmotic
pressure upon the differences of the tensions of aqueous vapours and aqueous solutions;
this, however, already enters into a special province of physical chemistry (certain data
are given in Note <a href="#Footnote_49_96">49</a> and following), and to this physical side of the question also belongs
one of the extreme consequences of the resemblance of osmotic pressure to gaseous
pressure, which is that the concentration of a uniform solution varies in parts which are
heated or cooled. Soret (1881) indeed observed that a solution of copper sulphate
containing 17 parts of the salt at 20° only contained 14 parts after heating the upper
portion of the tube to 80° for a long period of time. This aspect of solution, which is
now being very carefully and fully worked out, may be called the <i>physical</i> side. Its
other aspect is purely <i>chemical</i>, for solution does not take place between any two substances,
but requires a special and particular attraction or affinity between them. A
vapour or gas permeates any other vapour or gas, but a salt which dissolves in water may
not be in the least soluble in alcohol, and is quite insoluble in mercury. In considering
solutions as a manifestation of chemical force (and of chemical energy), it must be
acknowledged that they are here developed to so feeble an extent that the definite
compounds (that is, those formed according to the law of multiple proportions) formed
between water and a soluble substance dissociate even at the ordinary temperature,
forming a homogeneous system&mdash;that is, one in which both the compound and the products
into which it decomposes (water and the aqueous compound) occur in a liquid
state. The chief difficulty in the comprehension of solutions depends on the fact that
the mechanical theory of the structure of liquids has not yet been so fully developed as
the theory of gases, and solutions are liquids. The conception of solutions as liquid
dissociated definite chemical compounds is based on the following considerations: (1)
that there exist certain undoubtedly definite chemical crystallised compounds (such as
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O; or NaCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O; or CaCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O; &amp;c.) which melt on a certain rise of
temperature, and then form true solutions; (2) that metallic alloys in a molten condition
are real solutions, but on cooling they often give entirely distinct and definite crystallised
compounds, which are recognised by the properties of alloys; (3) that between the solvent
and the substance dissolved there are formed, in a number of cases, many undoubtedly
definite compounds, such as compounds with water of crystallisation; (4) that the
physical properties of solutions, and especially their specific gravities (a property which
can be very accurately determined), vary with a change in composition, and in such a
manner as would be required by the formation of one or more definite but dissociating
compounds. Thus, for example, on adding water to fuming sulphuric acid its density is
observed to decrease until it attains the definite composition H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O, when
the specific gravity increases, although on further diluting with water it again falls.
Moreover (Mendeléeff, <i>The Investigation of Aqueous Solutions from their Specific
Gravities</i>, 1887), the increase in specific gravity (<i>ds</i>), varies in all well-known solutions
with the proportion of the substance dissolved (<i>dp</i>), and this dependence can be expressed
by a formula (

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>ds</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>dp</i></span>
</span>

 = A + B<i>p</i>) between the limits of definite compounds whose existence
in solutions must be admitted, and this is in complete accordance with the dissociation
hypothesis. Thus, for instance, from H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O (both these substances
exist as definite compounds in a free state), the fraction

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>ds</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>dp</i></span>
</span>

 = 0·0729 - 0·000749<i>p</i> (where
<i>p</i> is the percentage amount of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). For alcohol C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, whose aqueous solutions
have been more accurately investigated than all others, the definite compound C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O +
3H<sub>2</sub>O, and others must be acknowledged in its solutions.</p>

<p>The two aspects of solution above mentioned, and the hypotheses which have as yet
been applied to the examination of solutions, although they have somewhat different
starting points, will doubtless in time lead to a general theory of solutions, because the
same common laws govern both physical and chemical phenomena, inasmuch as the
properties and motions of molecules, which determine physical properties, depend on
the motions and properties of atoms, which determine chemical reactions. For details
of the questions dealing with theories of solution, recourse must now be had to special
memoirs and to works on theoretical (physical) chemistry; for this subject forms one of
special interest at the present epoch of the development of our science. In working out
chiefly the chemical side of solutions, I consider it to be necessary to reconcile the two
aspects of the question; this seems to me to be all the more possible, as the physical side is
limited to dilute solutions only, whilst the chemical side deals mainly with strong solutions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_67" id="Footnote_20_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_67"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> A system of (chemically or physically) re-acting substances in different states of
aggregation&mdash;for instance, some solid, others liquid or gaseous&mdash;is termed a heterogeneous
system. Up to now it is only systems of this kind which can be subjected to
detailed examination in the sense of the mechanical theory of matter. Solutions (<i>i.e.</i>
unsaturated ones) form fluid homogeneous systems, which at the present time can only
be investigated with difficulty.</p>

<p>In the case of limited solution of liquids in liquids, <i>the difference between the solvent
and the substance dissolved</i> is clearly seen. The former (that is, the solvent) may be
added in an unlimited quantity, and yet the solution obtained will always be uniform,
whilst only a definite saturating proportion of the substance dissolved can be taken,
We will take water and common (sulphuric) ether. On shaking the ether with the
water, it will be remarked that a portion of it dissolves in the water. If the ether be
taken in such a quantity that it saturates the water and a portion of it remains undissolved,
then this remaining portion will act as a solvent, and water will diffuse through
it and also form a saturated solution of water in the ether taken. Thus two saturated
solutions will be obtained. One solution will contain ether dissolved in water, and the
other solution will contain water dissolved in ether. These two solutions will arrange
themselves in two layers, according to their density; the ethereal solution of water will
be on the top. If the upper ethereal solution be poured off from the aqueous solution,
any quantity of ether may be added to it; this shows that the dissolving substance is
ether. If water be added to it, it is no longer dissolved in it; this shows that water
saturates the ether&mdash;here water is the substance dissolved. If we act in the same
manner with the lower layer, we shall find that water is the solvent and ether the substance
dissolved. By taking different amounts of ether and water, the degree of
solubility of ether in water, and of water in ether, may be easily determined. Water
approximately dissolves <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> of its volume of ether, and ether dissolves a very small quantity
of water. Let us now imagine that the liquid poured in dissolves a considerable
amount of water, and that water dissolves a considerable amount of the liquid. Two
layers could not be formed, because the saturated solutions would resemble each other,
and therefore they would intermix in all proportions. This is, consequently, a case of
a phenomenon where two liquids present considerable co-efficients of solubility in each
other, but where it is impossible to say what these co-efficients are, because it is impossible
to obtain a saturated solution.</p></div>

<p class="caption" style="width: 250px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 16.&mdash;Bunsen's absorptiometer. Apparatus for
determining the solubility of gases in liquids.</p></div>

<p>The solubility, or co-efficient
of solubility, of a substance is
determined by various methods.
Either a solution is expressly
prepared with a clear excess of
the soluble substance and saturated
at a given temperature, and
the quantity of water and of the
substance dissolved in it determined
by evaporation, desiccation,
or other means; or else, as
is done with gases, definite quantities
of water and of the soluble
substance are taken and the
amount remaining undissolved is
determined.</p>

<p>The solubility of a gas in
water is determined by means of
an apparatus called an <i>absorptiometer</i>
(fig. <a href="#fig_16">16</a>). It consists of
an iron stand <i>f</i>, on which an
india-rubber ring rests. A wide
glass tube is placed on this ring,
and is pressed down on it by the
ring <i>h</i> and the screws <i>i i</i>. The
tube is thus firmly fixed on the
stand. A cock <i>r</i>, communicating
with a funnel <i>r</i>, passes into the
lower part of the stand. Mercury
can be poured into the wide tube
through this funnel, which is
therefore made of steel, as copper
would be affected by the mercury.
The upper ring <i>h</i> is furnished
with a cover <i>p</i>, which can
be firmly pressed down on to the
wide tube, and hermetically closes
it by means of an india-rubber
ring. The tube <i>r r</i> can be raised
at will, and so by pouring mercury
into the funnel the height of the
column of mercury, which produces
pressure inside the apparatus,
can be increased. The
pressure can also be diminished
at will, by letting mercury out
through the cock <i>r</i>. A graduated
tube <i>e</i>, containing the gas and
liquid to be experimented on, is
placed inside the wide tube. This
tube is graduated in millimetres
for determining the pressure, and
it is calibrated for volume, so that
the number of volumes occupied by the gas and liquid dissolving it can be easily calculated.
This tube can also be easily removed from the apparatus. The lower portion of this
tube when removed from the apparatus is shown to the right of the figure. It will be observed
that its lower end is furnished with a male screw <i>b</i>, fitting in a nut <i>a</i>. The lower
surface of the nut <i>a</i> is covered with india-rubber, so that on screwing up the tube its
lower end presses upon the india-rubber, and thus hermetically closes the whole tube, for
its upper end is fused up. The nut <i>a</i> is furnished with arms <i>c c</i>, and in the stand <i>f</i>
there are corresponding spaces, so that when the screwed-up internal tube is fixed into
stand <i>f</i>, the arms <i>c c</i> fix into these spaces cut in <i>f</i>. This enables the internal tube to be
fixed on to the stand <i>f</i>. When the internal tube is fixed in the stand, the wide tube is put
into its right position, and mercury and water are poured into the space between the two
tubes, and communication is opened between the inside of the tube <i>e</i> and the mercury
between the interior and exterior tubes. This is done by either revolving the interior
tube <i>e</i>, or by a key turning the nut about the bottom part of <i>f</i>. The tube <i>e</i> is filled with
gas and water as follows: the tube is removed from the apparatus, filled with mercury,
and the gas to be experimented on is passed into it. The volume of the gas is measured,
the temperature and pressure determined, and the volume it would occupy at 0° and
760 mm. calculated. A known volume of water is then introduced into the tube. The
water must be previously boiled, so as to be quite freed from air in solution. The tube is
then closed by screwing it down on to the india-rubber on the nut. It is then fixed on to
the stand <i>f</i>, mercury and water are poured into the intervening space between it and the
exterior tube, which is then screwed up and closed by the cover <i>p</i>, and the whole
apparatus is left at rest for some time, so that the tube <i>e</i>, and the gas in it, may attain the
same temperature as that of the surrounding water, which is marked by a thermometer
<i>k</i> tied to the tube <i>e</i>. The interior tube is then again closed by turning it in the nut,
the cover <i>p</i> again shut, and the whole apparatus is shaken in order that the gas in the
tube <i>e</i> may entirely saturate the water. After several shakings, the tube <i>e</i> is again
opened by turning it in the nut, and the apparatus is left at rest for a certain time; it is
then closed and again shaken, and so on until the volume of gas does not diminish after
a fresh shaking&mdash;that is, until saturation ensues. Observations are then made of the
temperature, the height of the mercury in the interior tube, and the level of the water in
it, and also of the level of the mercury and water in the exterior tube. All these data
are necessary in order to calculate the pressure under which the solution of the gas takes
place, and what volume of gas remains undissolved, and also the quantity of water which
serves as the solvent. By varying the temperature of the surrounding water, the amount
of gas dissolved at various temperatures may be determined. Bunsen, Carius, and
many others determined the solution of various gases in water, alcohol, and certain
other liquids, by means of this apparatus. If in a determination of this kind it is found
that <i>n</i> cubic centimetres of water at a pressure <i>h</i> dissolve <i>m</i> cubic centimetres of a
given gas, measured at 0° and 760 mm., when the temperature under which solution
took place was <i>t</i>°, then it follows that at the temperature <i>t the co-efficient of solubility
of the gas</i> in 1 volume of the liquid will be equal to

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>m</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span>
</span> ×

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">760</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>h</i></span>
</span>.</p>

<p>This formula is very clearly understood from the fact that the co-efficient of solubility
of gases is that quantity measured at 0° and 760 mm., which is absorbed at a pressure
of 760 mm. by one volume of a liquid. If <i>n</i> cubic centimetres of water absorb <i>m</i> cubic
centimetres of a gas, then one cubic centimetre absorbs

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>m</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span>
</span>. If

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>m</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span>
</span> c.c. of a gas are
absorbed under a pressure of <i>h</i> mm., then, according to the law of the variation of
solubility of a gas with the pressure, there would he dissolved, under a pressure of
760 mm., a quantity varying in the same ratio to <i>m</i>/<i>n</i> as 760 : <i>h</i>. In determining the
residual volume of gas its moisture (note <a href="#Footnote_1_47">1</a>) must be taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Below are given the number of grams of several substances saturating 100 grams of
water&mdash;that is, their co-efficients of solubility by weight at three different temperatures:&mdash;</p>

<p>Sometimes a substance is so slightly soluble that it may be considered as insoluble.
Many such substances are met with both in solids and liquids, and such a gas as oxygen,
although it does dissolve, does so in so small a proportion by weight that it might be
considered as zero did not the solubility of even so little oxygen play an important part
in nature (as in the respiration of fishes) and were not an infinitesimal quantity of a gas
by weight so easily measured by volume. The sign &#8734;, which stands on a line with sulphuric
acid in the above table, indicates that it intermixes with water in all proportions.
There are many such cases among liquids, and everybody knows, for instance, that spirit
(absolute alcohol) can be mixed in any proportion with water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_69" id="Footnote_22_69"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_69"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Just as the existence must he admitted of substances which are completely undecomposable
(chemically) at the ordinary temperature&mdash;and of substances which
are entirely non-volatile at such a temperature (as wood and gold), although capable of
decomposing (wood) or volatilising (gold) at a higher temperature&mdash;so also the existence
must be admitted of substances which are totally insoluble in water without some degree
of change in their state. Although mercury is partially volatile at the ordinary temperature,
there is no reason to think that it and other metals are soluble in water, alcohol,
or other similar liquids. However, mercury forms solutions, as it dissolves other metals.
On the other hand, there are many substances found in nature which are so very
slightly soluble in water, that in ordinary practice they may be considered as insoluble
(for example, barium sulphate). For the comprehension of that general plan according to
which a change of state of substances (combined or dissolved, solid, liquid, or gaseous)
takes place, it is very important to make a distinction at this boundary line (on approaching
zero of decomposition, volatility, or solubility) between an insignificant amount and
zero, but the present methods of research and the data at our disposal at the present
time only just touch such questions (by studying the electrical conductivity of dilute
solutions and the development of micro-organisms in them). It must be remarked,
besides, that water in a number of cases does not dissolve a substance as such, but acts
on it chemically and forms a soluble substance. Thus glass and many rocks, especially
if taken as powder, are chemically changed by water, but are not directly soluble in it.</p></div>

solubility, and he considered, in accordance with the general opinion, that by joining up
the summits of the ordinates in one harmonious curve it is possible to express the entire
change of solubility with the temperature. Now, there are many reasons for doubting
the accuracy of such an admission, for there are undoubtedly critical points in curves of
solubility (for example, of sodium sulphate, as shown further on), and it may be that
definite compounds of dissolved substances with water, in decomposing within known
limits of temperature, give critical points more often than would be imagined; it may
even be, indeed, that instead of a continuous curve, solubility should be expressed&mdash;if
not always, then not unfrequently&mdash;by straight or broken lines. According to Ditte, the
solubility of sodium nitrate, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, is expressed by the following figures per 100 parts
of water:&mdash;</p>

<p>In my opinion (1881) these data should be expressed with exactitude by a straight line,
67·5 + 0·87<i>t</i>, which entirely agrees with the results of experiment. According to this
the figure expressing the solubility of salt at 0° exactly coincides with the composition
of a definite chemical compound&mdash;NaNO<sub>3</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O. The experiments made by Ditte
showed that all saturated solutions between 0° and -15·7° have such a composition,
and that at the latter temperature the solution completely solidifies into one homogeneous
whole. Between 0° and -15·7° the solution NaNO<sub>3</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O does not deposit
either salt or ice. Thus the solubility of sodium nitrate is expressed by a broken
straight line. In recent times (1888) Étard discovered a similar phenomenon
in many of the sulphates. Brandes, in 1830, shows a diminution in solubility
below 100° for manganese sulphate. The percentage by weight (<i>i.e.</i> per 100 parts
of the solution, and not of water) of saturation for ferrous sulphate, FeSO<sub>4</sub>, from
-2° to +65° = 13·5 + 0·3784<i>t</i>&mdash;that is, the solubility of the salt increases. The solubility
remains constant from 65° to 98° (according to Brandes the solubility then increases;
this divergence of opinion requires proof), and from 98° to 150° it falls as = 104·35 -
0·6685<i>t</i>. Hence, at about +156° the solubility should = 0, and this has been confirmed
by experiment. I observe, on my part, that Étard's formula gives 38·1 p.c. of salt at
65° and 38·8 p.c. at 92°, and this maximum amount of salt in the solution very nearly
corresponds with the composition FeSO<sub>4</sub>,14H<sub>2</sub>O, which requires 37·6 p.c. From what
has been said, it is evident that the data concerning solubility require a new method of
investigation, which should have in view the entire scale of solubility&mdash;from the formation
of completely solidified solutions (cryohydrates, which we shall speak of presently)
to the separation of salts from their solutions, if this is accomplished at a higher temperature
(for manganese and cadmium sulphates there is an entire separation, according

according to Étard, remains constant from 163° to 220° and equals 24·9 p.c.)

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_72" id="Footnote_25_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_72"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> The latent heat of fusion is determined at the temperature of fusion, whilst solution
takes place at the ordinary temperature, and one must think that at this temperature
the latent heat would be different, just as the latent heat of evaporation varies with
the temperature (see Note <a href="#Footnote_11_57">11</a>). Besides which, in dissolving, disintegration of the
particles of both the solvent and the substance dissolved takes place, a process which in
its mechanical aspect resembles evaporation, and therefore must consume much heat.
The heat emitted in the solution of a solid must therefore be considered (Personne) as
composed of three factors&mdash;(1) positive, the effect of combination; (2) negative, the effect
of transference into a liquid state; and (3) negative, the effect of disintegration. In the
solution of a liquid by a liquid the second factor is removed; and therefore, if the heat
evolved in combination is greater than that absorbed in disintegration a heating effect is
observed, and in the reverse case a cooling effect; and, indeed, sulphuric acid, alcohol,
and many liquids evolve heat in dissolving in each other. But the solution of chloroform
in carbon bisulphide (Bussy and Binget), or of phenol (or aniline) in water (Alexéeff),
produces cold. In the solution of a small quantity of water in acetic acid (Abasheff), or
hydrocyanic acid (Bussy and Binget), or amyl alcohol (Alexéeff), cold is produced, whilst
in the solution of these substances in an excess of water heat is evolved.</p>

<p>The relation existing between the solubility of solid bodies and the heat and temperature
of fusion and solution has been studied by many investigators, and more recently
(1893) by Schröder, who states that in the solution of a solid body in a solvent which
does not act chemically upon it, a very simple process takes place, which differs but little
from the intermixture of two gases which do not react chemically upon each other. The
following relation between the heat of solution <i>Q</i> and the heat of fusion <i>p</i> may then be
taken:

 = constant, where <i>T</i><sub>0</sub> and <i>T</i> are the absolute (from -273°) temperatures
of fusion and saturation. Thus, for instance, in the case of naphthalene the calculated
and observed magnitudes of the heat of solution differ but slightly from each other.</p>

<p>The fullest information concerning the solution of liquids in liquids has been
gathered by W. T. Alexéeff (1883&ndash;1885); these data are, however, far from being
sufficient to solve the mass of problems respecting this subject. He showed that two
liquids which dissolve in each other, intermix together in all proportions at a certain
temperature. Thus the solubility of phenol, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, in water, and the converse, is
limited up to 70°, whilst above this temperature they intermix in all proportions. This
is seen from the following figures, where p is the percentage amount of phenol and <i>t</i>
the temperature at which the solution becomes turbid&mdash;that is, that at which it is
saturated:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is exactly the same with the solution of benzene, aniline, and other substances in
molten sulphur. Alexéeff discovered a similar complete intermixture for solutions of
secondary butyl alcohol in water at about 107°; at lower temperatures the solubility is
not only limited, but between 50° and 70° it is at its minimum, both for solutions of the
alcohol in water and for water in the alcohol; and at a temperature of 5° both solutions
exhibit a fresh change in their scale of solubility, so that a solution of the alcohol in
water which is saturated between 5° and 40° will become turbid when heated to 60°.
In the solution of liquids in liquids, Alexéeff observed a lowering in temperature (an
absorption of heat) and an absence of change in specific heat (calculated for the mixture)
much more frequently than had been done by previous observers. As regards his hypothesis
(in the sense of a mechanical and not a chemical representation of solutions) that
substances in solution preserve their physical states (as gases, liquids, or solids), it is
very doubtful, for it would necessitate admitting the presence of ice in water or its
vapour.</p>

<p>From what has been said above, it will be clear that even in so very simple a case as
solution, it is impossible to calculate the heat emitted by chemical action alone, and that
the chemical process cannot be separated from the physical and mechanical.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_73" id="Footnote_26_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_73"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The cooling effect produced in the solution of solids (and also in the expansion of
gases and in evaporation) is applied to the <i>production of low temperatures</i>. Ammonium
nitrate is very often used for this purpose; in dissolving in water it absorbs 77
units of heat per each part by weight. On evaporating the solution thus formed, the
solid salt is re-obtained. The application of the various <i>freezing mixtures</i> is based on
the same principle. Snow or broken ice frequently enters into the composition of these
<i>mixtures</i>, advantage being taken of its latent heat of fusion in order to obtain the
lowest possible temperature (without altering the pressure or employing heat, as in other
methods of obtaining a low temperature). For laboratory work recourse is most often
had to a mixture of three parts of snow and one part of common salt, which causes the
temperature to fall from 0° to -21° C. Potassium thiocyanate, KCNS, mixed with
water (&frac34; by weight of the salt) gives a still lower temperature. By mixing ten parts of
crystallised calcium chloride, CaCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, with seven parts of snow, the temperature
may even fall from 0° to -55°.</p></div>

sometimes made use of in practice. Thus caustic soda (NaHO), in dissolving or on the
addition of water to a strong solution of it, evolves so much heat that it can replace fuel.
In a steam boiler, which has been previously heated to the boiling point, another boiler
is placed containing caustic soda, and the exhaust steam is made to pass through the
latter; the formation of steam then goes on for a somewhat long period of time without
any other heating. Norton makes use of this for smokeless street locomotives.</p></div>

(100 c.c.) of the solution produced. The top curve expresses the degree of contraction,
which also corresponds with 100 volumes of the solution produced. The greatest contraction,
as also the greatest rise of temperature, corresponds with the formation of a
trihydrate, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O (= 73·1 p.c. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), which very likely repeats itself in a similar
form in other solutions, although all the phenomena (of contraction, evolution of heat, and
rise of temperature) are very complex and are dependent on many circumstances. One
would think, however, judging from the above examples, that all other influences are
feebler in their action than chemical attraction, especially when it is so considerable as

<p>The decrease in the coefficient of absorption with the temperature must be connected
with a change in the physical properties of the water. Winkler (1891) remarked a certain
relation between the internal friction and the coefficient of absorption at various temperatures.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_78" id="Footnote_31_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_78"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> These figures show that the co-efficient of solubility decreases with an increase of
pressure, notwithstanding that the carbonic anhydride approaches a liquid state. As a
matter of fact, liquefied carbonic anhydride does not intermix with water, and does not
exhibit a rapid increase in solubility at its temperature of liquefaction. This indicates,
in the first place, that solution does not consist in liquefaction, and in the second place
that the solubility of a substance is determined by a peculiar attraction of water for the
substance dissolving. Wroblewski even considered it possible to admit that a dissolved
gas retains its properties as a gas. This he deduced from experiments, which showed
that the rate of diffusion of gases in a solvent is, for gases of different densities, inversely
proportional to the square roots of their densities, just as the velocities of gaseous molecules
(see Note <a href="#Footnote_34_81">34</a>). Wroblewski showed the affinity of water, H<sub>2</sub>O, for carbonic
anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, from the fact that on expanding moist compressed carbonic anhydride
(compressed at 0° under a pressure of 10 atmospheres) he obtained (a fall in temperature
takes place from the expansion) a very unstable definite crystalline compound, CO<sub>2</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_79" id="Footnote_32_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_79"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> As, according to the researches of Roscoe and his collaborators, ammonia exhibits
a considerable deviation at low temperatures from the law of Henry and Dalton, whilst
at 100° the deviation is small, it would appear that the dissociating influence of temperature
affects all gaseous solutions; that is, at high temperatures, the solutions of all
gases will follow the law, and at lower temperatures there will in all cases be a deviation
from it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_80" id="Footnote_33_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_80"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The ratio between the pressure and the amount of gas dissolved was discovered by
Henry in 1805, and Dalton in 1807 pointed out the adaptability of this law to cases of
gaseous mixtures, introducing the conception of partial pressures which is absolutely
necessary for a right comprehension of Dalton's law. The conception of partial pressures
essentially enters into that of the diffusion of vapours in gases (footnote 1); for the
pressure of damp air is equal to the sum of the pressures of dry air and of the aqueous
vapour in it, and it is admitted as a corollary to Dalton's law that evaporation in dry
air takes place as in a vacuum. It is, however, necessary to remark that the volume of
a mixture of two gases (or vapours) is only approximately equal to the sum of the volumes
of its constituents (the same, naturally, also refers to their pressures)&mdash;that is to say, in
mixing gases a change of volume occurs, which, although small, is quite apparent when
carefully measured. For instance, in 1888 Brown showed that on mixing various volumes
of sulphurous anhydride (SO<sub>2</sub>) with carbonic anhydride (at equal pressures of 760 mm.
and equal temperatures) a decrease of pressure of 3·9 millimetres of mercury was
observed. The possibility of a chemical action in similar mixtures is evident from the
fact that equal volumes of sulphurous and carbonic anhydrides at -19° form, according
to Pictet's researches in 1888, a liquid which may be regarded as an unstable chemical
compound, or a solution similar to that given when sulphurous anhydride and water
combine to an unstable chemical whole.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_81" id="Footnote_34_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_81"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> The origin of the kinetic theory of gases now generally accepted, according to
which they are animated by a rapid progressive motion, is very ancient (Bernouilli and
others in the last century had already developed a similar representation), but it was
only generally accepted after the mechanical theory of heat had been established, and
after the work of Krönig (1855), and especially after its mathematical side had been
worked out by Clausius and Maxwell. The pressure, elasticity, diffusion, and internal
friction of gases, the laws of Boyle, Mariotte, and of Gay-Lussac and Avogadro-Gerhardt
are not only explained (deduced) by the kinetic theory of gases, but also expressed with
perfect exactitude; thus, for example, the magnitude of the internal friction of different
gases was foretold with exactitude by Maxwell, by applying the theory of probabilities
to the impact of gaseous particles. The kinetic theory of gases must therefore be
considered as one of the most brilliant acquisitions of the latter half of the present
century. The velocity of the progressive motion of the particles of a gas, one cubic
centimetre of which weighs <i>d</i> grams, is found, according to the theory, to be equal to
the square root of the product of 3<i>pDq</i> divided by <i>d</i>, where <i>p</i> is the pressure under which
<i>d</i> is determined expressed in centimetres of the mercury column, <i>D</i> the weight of a cubic
centimetre of mercury in grams (<i>D</i> = 13·59, <i>p</i> = 76, consequently the normal pressure =
1,033 grams on a sq. cm.), and <i>g</i> the acceleration of gravity in centimetres (<i>g</i> = 980·5,
at the sea level and long. 45° = 981·92 at St. Petersburg; in general it varies with the
longitude and altitude of the locality). Therefore, at 0° the velocity of hydrogen is 1,843,
and of oxygen 461, metres per second. This is the average velocity, and (according to
Maxwell and others) it is probable that the velocities of individual particles are different;
that is, they occur in, as it were, different conditions of temperature, which it is very
important to take into consideration in investigating many phenomena proper to matter.
It is evident from the above determination of the velocity of gases, that different gases
at the same temperature and pressure have average velocities, which are inversely proportional
to the square roots of their densities; this is also shown by direct experiment
on the flow of gases through a fine orifice, or through a porous wall. This <i>dissimilar
velocity of flow</i> for different gases is frequently taken advantage of in chemical
researches (see Chap. <a href="#Page_113">II.</a> and also Chap. <a href="#Page_299">VII.</a>) in order to separate two gases having
different densities and velocities. The difference of the velocity of flow of gases also
determines the phenomenon cited in the following footnote for demonstrating the existence
of an internal motion in gases.</p>

<p>If for a certain mass of a gas which fully and exactly follows the laws of Mariotte
and Gay-Lussac the temperature <i>t</i> and the pressure <i>p</i> be changed simultaneously, then
the entire change would be expressed by the equation <i>pv</i> = <i>C</i>(1 + <i>at</i>), or, what is the
same, <i>pv</i> = <i>RT</i>, where <i>T</i> = <i>t</i> + 273 and <i>C</i> and <i>R</i> are constants which vary not only with the
units taken but with the nature of the gas and its mass. But as there are discrepancies
from both the fundamental laws of gases (which will be discussed in the <a href="#Page_113">following
chapter</a>), and as, on the one hand, a certain attraction between the gaseous molecules
must be admitted, while on the other hand the molecules of gases themselves must
occupy a portion of a space, hence for ordinary gases, within any considerable variation
of pressure and temperature, recourse should be had to Van der Waal's formula&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">(<i>p</i> +

<span class="fdn"><i>v</i><sup>2</sup></span>
</span>

)(<i>v</i> - <i>p</i>) = R(1 + <i>at</i>)</p>

<p class="noindent">where <i>a</i> is the true co-efficient of expansion of gases.</p>

<p>The formula of Van der Waals has an especially important significance in the case
of the passage of a gas into a liquid state, because the fundamental properties of both
gases and liquids are equally well expressed by it, although only in their general
features.</p>

<p>The further development of the questions referring to the subjects here touched on,
which are of especial interest for the theory of solutions, must be looked for in special
memoirs and works on theoretical and physical chemistry. A small part of this subject
will be partially considered in the footnotes of the <a href="#Page_113">following chapter</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_82" id="Footnote_35_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_82"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Although the actual motion of gaseous molecules, which is accepted by the
kinetic theory of gases, cannot be seen, yet its existence may be rendered evident by
taking advantage of the difference in the velocities undoubtedly belonging to different
gases which are of different densities under equal pressures. The molecules of a
light gas must move more rapidly than the molecules of a heavier gas in order to produce
the same pressure. Let us take, therefore, two gases&mdash;hydrogen and air; the
former is 14·4 times lighter than the latter, and hence the molecules of hydrogen must
move almost four times more quickly than air (more exactly 3·8, according to the formula
given in the preceding footnote). Consequently, if a porous cylinder containing air is
introduced into an atmosphere of hydrogen, then in a given time the volume of hydrogen
which succeeds in entering the cylinder will be greater than the volume of air leaving
the cylinder, and therefore the pressure inside the cylinder will rise until the gaseous
mixture (of air and hydrogen) attains an equal density both inside and outside the
cylinder. If now the experiment be reversed and air surround the cylinder, and
hydrogen be inside the cylinder, then more gas will leave the cylinder than enters it, and
hence the pressure inside the cylinder will be diminished. In these considerations we
have replaced the idea of the number of molecules by the idea of volumes. We shall
learn subsequently that equal volumes of different gases contain an equal number of
molecules (the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt), and therefore instead of speaking of the
number of molecules we can speak of the number of volumes. If the cylinder be partially
immersed in water the rise and fall of the pressure can be observed directly, and
the experiment consequently rendered self-evident.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_83" id="Footnote_36_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_83"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Here two cases occur; either the atmosphere surrounding the solution may be
limited, or it may be proportionally so vast as to be unlimited, like the earth's atmosphere.
If a gaseous solution be brought into an atmosphere of another gas which is
limited&mdash;for instance, as in a closed vessel&mdash;then a portion of the gas held in solution
will be expelled, and thus pass over into the atmosphere surrounding the solution, and
will produce its partial pressure. Let us imagine that water saturated with carbonic
anhydride at 0° and under the ordinary pressure is brought into an atmosphere of a gas
which is not absorbed by water; for instance, that 10 c.c. of an aqueous solution of carbonic
anhydride is introduced into a vessel holding 10 c.c. of such a gas. The solution
will contain 18 c.c. of carbonic anhydride. The expulsion of this gas proceeds until a
state of equilibrium is arrived at. The liquid will then contain a certain amount of
carbonic anhydride, which is retained under the partial pressure of that gas which has
been expelled. Now, how much gas will remain in the liquid and how much will pass
over into the surrounding atmosphere? In order to solve this problem, let us suppose
that <i>x</i> cubic centimetres of carbonic anhydride are retained in the solution. It is evident
that the amount of carbonic anhydride which passed over into the surrounding atmosphere
will be 18 - <i>x</i>, and the total volume of gas will be 10 + 18 - <i>x</i> or 28 - <i>x</i> cubic centimetres.
The partial pressure under which the carbonic anhydride is then dissolved will
be (supposing that the common pressure remains constant the whole time) equal to

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">18 - <i>x</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">28 - <i>x</i></span>
</span>,

hence there is not in solution 18 c.c. of carbonic anhydride (as would be
the case were the partial pressure equal to the atmospheric pressure), but only 18

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">18 - <i>x</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">28 - <i>x</i></span>
</span>,

which is equal to <i>x</i>, and we therefore obtain the equation 18

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">18 - <i>x</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">28 - <i>x</i></span>
</span>

= <i>x</i>,
hence <i>x</i> = 8·69. Again, where the atmosphere into which the gaseous solution is introduced
is not only that of another gas but also unlimited, then the gas dissolved will, on
passing over from the solution, diffuse into this atmosphere, and produce an infinitely
small pressure in the unlimited atmosphere. Consequently, no gas can be retained in
solution under this infinitely small pressure, and it will be entirely expelled from the
solution. For this reason water saturated with a gas which is not contained in air, will
be entirely deprived of the dissolved gas if left exposed to the air. Water also passes
off from a solution into the atmosphere, and it is evident that there might be such a
case as a constant proportion between the quantity of water vaporised and the quantity
of a gas expelled from a solution, so that not the gas alone, but the entire gaseous solution,
would pass off. A similar case is exhibited in solutions which are not decomposed
by heat (such as those of hydrogen chloride and iodide), as will afterwards be considered.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_84" id="Footnote_37_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_84"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> However, in those cases when the variation of the co-efficient of solubility with the
temperature is not sufficiently great, and when a known quantity of aqueous vapour
and of the gas passes off from a solution at the boiling point, an atmosphere may be
obtained having the same composition as the liquid itself. In this case the amount of
gas passing over into such an atmosphere will not be greater than that held by the
liquid, and therefore such a gaseous solution will distil over unchanged. The solution
will then represent, like a solution of hydriodic acid in water, a liquid which is not
altered by distillation, while the pressure under which this distillation takes place remains
constant. Thus in all its aspects solution presents gradations from the most feeble
affinities to examples of intimate chemical combination. The <i>amount of heat</i> evolved in
the solution of equal volumes of different gases is in distinct relation with these variations
of stability and solubility of different gases. 22·3 litres of the following gases (at 760
mm. pressure) evolve the following number of (gram) units of heat in dissolving in a
large mass of water; carbonic anhydride 5,600, sulphurous anhydride 7,700, ammonia
8,800, hydrochloric acid 17,400, and hydriodic acid 19,400. The two last-named gases,
which are not expelled from their solution by boiling, evolve approximately twice as
much heat as gases like ammonia, which are separated from their solutions by boiling,
whilst gases which are only slightly soluble evolve very much less heat.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_85" id="Footnote_38_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_85"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Among the numerous researches concerning this subject, certain results obtained
by Paul Bert are cited in Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>., and we will here point out that Prof. Sechenoff,
in his researches on the absorption of gases by liquids, very fully investigated the
phenomena of the solution of carbonic anhydride in solutions of various salts, and
arrived at many important results, which showed that, on the one hand, in the solution
of carbonic anhydride in solutions of salts on which it is capable of acting chemically (for
example, sodium carbonate, borax, ordinary sodium phosphate), there is not only an
increase of solubility, but also a distinct deviation from the law of Henry and Dalton;
whilst, on the other hand, that solutions of salts which are not acted on by carbonic
anhydride (for example, the chlorides, nitrates, and sulphates) absorb less of it, owing to
the &lsquo;competition&rsquo; of the salt already dissolved, and follow the law of Henry and Dalton,
but at the same time show undoubted signs of a chemical action between the salt, water,
and carbonic anhydride. Sulphuric acid (whose co-efficient of absorption is 92 vols. per
100), when diluted with water, absorbs less and less carbonic anhydride, until the hydrate
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O (co-eff. of absorption then equals 66 vols.) is formed; then on further
addition of water the solubility again rises until a solution of 100 p.c. of water is
obtained.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_86" id="Footnote_39_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_86"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Kremers made this observation in the following simple form:&mdash;He took a narrow-necked
flask, with a mark on the narrow part (like that on a litre flask which is used for
accurately measuring liquids), poured water into it, and then inserted a funnel, having a
fine tube which reached to the bottom of the flask. Through this funnel he carefully
poured a solution of any salt, and (having removed the funnel) allowed the liquid to
attain a definite temperature (in a water bath); he then filled the flask up to the mark
with water. In this manner two layers of liquid were obtained, the heavy saline solution
below and water above. The flask was then shaken in order to accelerate diffusion, and
it was observed that the volume became less if the temperature remained constant.
This can be proved by calculation, if the specific gravity of the solutions and water be
known. Thus at 15° one c.c. of a 20 p.c. solution of common salt weighs 1·1500 gram,
hence 100 grams occupy a volume of 86·96 c.c. As the sp. gr. of water at 15° = 0·99916,
therefore 100 grams of water occupy a volume of 100·08 c.c. The sum of the volumes is
187·04 c.c. After mixing, 200 grams of a 10 p.c. solution are obtained. Its specific gravity
is 1·0725 (at 15° and referred to water at its maximum density), hence the 200 grams
will occupy a volume of 186·48 c.c. The contraction is consequently equal to 0·56 c.c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_87" id="Footnote_40_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_87"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> The contractions produced in the case of the solution of sulphuric acid in water
are shown in the diagram Fig. <a href="#fig_17">17</a> (page <a href="#Page_77">77</a>). Their maximum is 10·1 c.c. per 100 c.c. of
the solution formed. A maximum contraction of 4·15 at 0°, 3·78 at 15°, and 3·50 at 30°,
takes place in the solution of 46 parts by weight of anhydrous alcohol in 54 parts of
water. This signifies that if, at 0°, 46 parts by weight of alcohol be taken per 54 parts
by weight of water, then the sum of their separate volumes will he 104·15, and after
mixing their total volume will be 100.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_88" id="Footnote_41_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_88"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> This subject will be considered later in this work, and we shall then see that the
contraction produced in reactions of combination (of solids or liquids) is very variable
in its amount, and that there are, although rarely, reactions of combination in which
contraction does not take place, or when an increase of volume is produced.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_89" id="Footnote_42_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_89"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The compressibility of solutions of common salt is less, according to Grassi, than
that of water. At 18° the compression of water per million volumes = 48 vols. for a
pressure of one atmosphere; for a 15 p.c. solution of common salt it is 32, and for a 24
p.c. solution 26 vols. Similar determinations were made by Brown (1887) for saturated
solutions of sal ammoniac (38 vols.), alum (46 vols.), common salt (27 vols.), and sodium
sulphate at +1°, when the compressibility of water = 47 per million volumes. This
investigator also showed that substances which dissolve with an evolution of heat and
with an increase in volume (as, for instance, sal ammoniac) are partially separated from
their saturated solutions by an increase of pressure (this experiment was particularly
conclusive in the case of sal ammoniac), whilst the solubility of substances which dissolve
with an absorption of heat or diminution in volume increases, although very slightly,
<i>with an increase of pressure</i>. Sorby observed the same phenomenon with common
salt (1863).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_90" id="Footnote_43_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_90"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> The most trustworthy data relating to the variation of the specific gravity of
solutions with a change of their composition and temperature, are collected and discussed
in my work cited in footnote 19. The practical (for the amount of a substance in
solution is determined by the aid of the specific gravities of solutions, both in works and
in laboratory practice) and the theoretical (for specific gravity can be more accurately
observed than other properties, and because a variation in specific gravity governs the
variation of many other properties) interest of this subject, besides the strict rules and
laws to which it is liable, make one wish that this province of data concerning solutions
may soon be enriched by further observations of as accurate a nature as possible. Their
collection does not present any great difficulty, although requiring much time and attention.
Pickering in London and Tourbaba in Kharkoff must be ranked first among those
who have pursued problems of this nature during recent years.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_91" id="Footnote_44_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_91"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> Inasmuch as the degree of change exhibited in many properties on the formation of
solutions is not large, so, owing to the insufficient accuracy of observations, a proportionality
between this change and a change of composition may, in a first rough approximation
and especially within narrow limits of change of composition, easily be imagined in
cases where it does not even exist. The conclusion of Michel and Kraft is particularly
instructive in this respect; in 1854, on the basis of their incomplete researches, they
supposed that the increment of the specific gravity of solutions was proportional to the
increment of a salt in a given volume of a solution, which is only true for determinations
of specific gravity which are exact to the second decimal place&mdash;an accuracy insufficient
even for technical determinations. Accurate measurements do not confirm a proportionality
either in this case or in many others where a ratio has been generally accepted;
as, for example, for the rotatory power (with respect to the plane of polarisation) of solutions,
and for their capillarity, &amp;c. Nevertheless, such a method is not only still made
use of, but even has its advantages when applied to solutions within a limited scope&mdash;as,
for instance, very weak solutions, and for a first acquaintance with the phenomena
accompanying solution, and also as a means for facilitating the application of mathematical
analysis to the investigation of the phenomenon of solution. Judging by the
results obtained in my researches on the specific gravity of solutions, I think that in
many cases it would be nearer the truth to take the change of properties as proportional,
not to the amount of a substance dissolved, but to the product of this quantity and the
amount of water in which it is dissolved; the more so since many chemical relations
vary in proportion to the reacting masses, and a similar ratio has been established for
many phenomena of attraction studied by mechanics. This product is easily arrived at
when the quantity of water in the solutions to be compared is constant, as is shown in
investigating the fall of temperature in the formation of ice (<i>see</i> footnote 49, p. 91).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_92" id="Footnote_45_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_92"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> All the different forms of chemical reaction may be said to take place in the process
of solution. (1) <i>Combinations</i> between the solvent and the substance dissolved, which
are more or less stable (more or less dissociated). This form of reaction is the most
probable, and is that most often observed. (2) Reactions of <i>substitution</i> or of <i>double
decomposition</i> between the molecules. Thus it may be supposed that in the solution of
sal ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, the action of water produces ammonia, NH<sub>4</sub>HO, and hydrochloric
acid, HCl, which are dissolved in the water and simultaneously attract each other. As
these solutions and many others do indeed exhibit signs, which are sometimes indisputable,
of similar double decompositions (thus solutions of sal-ammoniac yield a certain
amount of ammonia), it is probable that this form of reaction is more often met with
than is generally thought. (3) Reactions of <i>isomerism</i> or <i>replacement</i> are also probably
met with in solution, all the more as here molecules of different kinds come into intimate
contact, and it is very likely that the configuration of the atoms in the molecules under
these influences is somewhat different from what it was in its original and isolated
state. One is led to this supposition especially from observations made on solutions of
substances which rotate the plane of polarisation (and observations of this kind are very
sensitive with respect to the atomic structure of molecules), because they show, for
example (according to Schneider, 1881), that strong solutions of malic acid rotate the
plane of polarisation to the right, whilst its ammonium salts in all degrees of concentration
rotate the plane of polarisation to the left. (4) Reactions of <i>decomposition</i> under
the influences of solution are not only rational in themselves, but have in recent years
been recognised by Arrhenius, Ostwald, and others, particularly on the basis of electrolytic
determinations. If a portion of the molecules of a solution occur in a condition of
decomposition, the other portion may occur in a yet more complex state of combination,
just as the velocity of the motion of different gaseous molecules may be far from being
the same (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_34_81">34</a>, p. 81).</p>

<p>It is, therefore, very probable that the reactions taking place in solution vary both
quantitatively and qualitatively with the mass of water in the solution, and the great
difficulty in arriving at a definite conclusion as to the nature of the chemical relations
which take place in the process of solution will be understood, and if besides this
the existence of a physical process, like the sliding between and interpenetration of
two homogeneous liquids, be also recognised in solution, then the complexity of the
problem as to the actual nature of solutions, which is now to the fore, appears in its
true light. However, the efforts which are now being applied to the solution of this
problem are so numerous and of such varied aspect that they will afford future
investigators a vast mass of material towards the construction of a complete theory
of solution.</p>

<p>For my part, I am of opinion that the study of the physical properties of solutions
(and especially of weak ones) which now obtains, cannot give any fundamental and complete
solution of the problem whatever (although it should add much to both the
provinces of physics and chemistry), but that, parallel with it, should be undertaken the
study of the influence of temperature, and especially of low temperatures, the application
to solutions of the mechanical theory of heat, and the comparative study of the chemical
properties of solutions. The beginning of all this is already established, but it is
impossible to consider in so short an exposition of chemistry the further efforts of this
kind which have been made up to the present date.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_93" id="Footnote_46_93"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_93"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> If solutions are regarded as being in a state of dissociation (<i>see</i> footnote 19, p. 64) it
would be expected that they would contain free molecules of water, which form one of the
products of the decomposition of those definite compounds whose formation is the cause
of solution. In separating as ice or vapour, water makes, with a solution, a heterogeneous
system (made up of substances in different physical states) similar, for instance,
to the formation of a precipitate or volatile substance in reactions of double decomposition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_94" id="Footnote_47_94"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_94"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> If the substance dissolved is non-volatile (like salt or sugar), or only slightly volatile,
then the whole of the tension of the vapour given off is due to the water, but if a
solution of a volatile substance&mdash;for instance, a gas or a volatile liquid&mdash;evaporates, then
only a portion of the pressure belongs to the water, and the whole pressure observed
consists of the sum of the pressures of the vapours of the water and of the substance
dissolved. The majority of researches bear on the first case, which will be spoken of
presently, and the observations of D. P. Konovaloff (1881) refer to the second case. He
showed that in the case of two volatile liquids, mutually soluble in each other, forming
two layers of saturated solutions (for example, ether and water, Note <a href="#Footnote_20_67">20</a>, p. 67), both solutions
have an equal vapour tension (in the case in point the tension of both is equal to
431 mm. of mercury at 19·8°). Further, he found that for solutions which are formed
in all proportions, the tension is either greater (solutions of alcohol and water) or less
(solutions of formic acid) than that which answers to the rectilinear change (proportional
to the composition) from the tension of water to the tension of the substance dissolved;
thus, the tension, for example, of a 70 p.c. solution of formic acid is less, at all temperatures,
than the tension of water and of formic acid itself. In this case the tension of a
solution is never equal to the sum of the tensions of the dissolving liquids, as Regnault
already showed when he distinguished this case from that in which a mixture of liquids,
which are insoluble in each other, evaporates. From this it is evident that a mutual
action occurs in solution, which diminishes the vapour tensions proper to the individual
substances, as would be expected on the supposition of the formation of compounds in
solutions, because the elasticity then always diminishes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_48_95" id="Footnote_48_95"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_95"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> This amount is usually expressed by the weight of the substance dissolved per
100 parts by weight of water. Probably it would be better to express it by the quantity of
the substance in a definite volume of the solution&mdash;for instance, in a litre&mdash;or by the
ratios of the number of molecules of water and of the substance dissolved.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_96" id="Footnote_49_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_96"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> The variation of the vapour tension of solutions has been investigated by many.
The best known researches are those of Wüllner in Germany (1858&ndash;1860) and of Tamman
in Russia (1887). The researches on the temperature of the formation of ice from various
solutions are also very numerous; Blagden (1788), Rüdorff (1861), and De Coppet (1871)
established the beginning, but this kind of investigation takes its chief interest from the
work of Raoult, begun in 1882 on aqueous solutions, and afterwards continued for solutions
in various other easily frozen liquids&mdash;for instance, benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (melts at 4·96°),
acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (16·75°), and others. An especially important interest is attached to
these cryoscopic investigations of Raoult in France on the depression of the freezing
point, because he took solutions of many well-known carbon-compounds and discovered
a simple relation between the molecular weight of the substances and the temperature
of crystallisation of the solvent, which enabled this kind of research to be applied to the
investigation of the nature of substances. We shall meet with the application of this
method later on (<i>see also</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_299">VII</a>.), and at present will only cite the deduction
arrived at from these results. The solution of one-hundredth part of that molecular
gram weight which corresponds with the formula of a substance dissolved (for example,
NaCl = 58·5, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O = 46, &amp;c.) in 100 parts of a solvent lowers the freezing point of its
solution in water 0·185°, in benzene 0·49°, and in acetic acid O·39°, or twice as much as
with water. And as in weak solutions the depression or fall of freezing point is proportional
to the amount of the substance dissolved, it follows that the fall of freezing point
for all other solutions may be calculated from this rule. So, for instance, the weight
which corresponds with the formula of acetone, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O is 58; a solution containing 2·42,
6·22, and 12·35 grams of acetone per 100 grams of water, forms ice (according to the
determinations of Beckmann) at 0·770°, 1·930°, and 3·820°, and these figures show that
with a solution containing 0·58 gram of acetone per 100 of water the fall of the temperature
of the formation of ice will be 0·185°, 0·180°, and 0·179°. It must be remarked that
the law of proportionality between the fall of temperature of the formation of ice, and
the composition of a solution, is in general only approximate, and is only applicable to
weak solutions (Pickering and others).</p>

<p>We will here remark that the theoretical interest of this subject was strengthened
on the discovery of the connection existing between the fall of tension, the fall of the
temperature of the formation of ice, of osmotic pressure (Van't Hoff, Note <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>), and of the
electrical conductivity of solutions, and we will therefore supplement what we have
already said on the subject by some short remarks on the method of cryoscopic investigations,
although the details of the subject form the subject of more special works on
physical chemistry (such as Ostwald's <i>Lehrbuch der allgemeinen Chemie</i>, 1891&ndash;1894,
2 vols.)</p>

<p>In order to determine the <i>temperature of the formation of ice</i> (or of crystallisation
of other solvents), a solution of known strength is prepared and poured into a cylindrical
vessel surrounded by a second similar vessel, leaving a layer of air between the two, which,
being a bad conductor, prevents any rapid change of temperature. The bulb of a sensitive
and corrected thermometer is immersed in the solution, and also a bent platinum
wire for stirring the solution; the whole is then cooled (by immersing the apparatus in
a freezing mixture), and the temperature at which ice begins to separate observed. If
the temperature at first falls slightly lower, it nevertheless becomes constant when ice
begins to form. By then allowing the liquid to get just warm, and again observing the
temperature of the formation of ice, an exact determination may be arrived at. It is still
better to take a large mass of solution, and induce the formation of the first crystals by
dropping a small lump of ice into the solution already partially over-cooled. This only
imperceptibly changes the composition of the solution. The observation should be made
at the point of formation of only a very small amount of crystals, as otherwise the
composition of the solution will become altered from their separation. Every precaution
must be taken to prevent the access of moisture to the interior of the apparatus, which
might also alter the composition of the solution or properties of the solvent (for instance,
when using acetic acid).</p>

<p>With respect to the depression of dilute solutions it is known&mdash;(1) That the depression
increases in almost direct proportion to the amount of the substance in solution (always
per 100 parts of water), for example, for KCl when the solution contains 1 part of salt
(per 100 parts of water) the depression = 0·45°, when the solution contains 2 parts of salt
= 0·90°, with 10 parts of salt = 4·4°. (2) The greater the molecular weight expressed by
the formula (see Chapter <a href="#Page_299">VII</a>.), and designated by M, the less, under other similar conditions,
will be the depression <i>d</i>, and therefore if the concentration of a solution (the
amount by weight of substance dissolved per 100 parts of water) be designated by <i>p</i>, then
the fraction M

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>d</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>p</i></span>
</span>

or the molecular depression for a given class of substances will be a
constant quantity; for example, in the case of methyl alcohol in water 17·3, for acetone
about 18·0, for sugar about 18·5. (3) In general the molecular depression for substances
whose solutions do not conduct an electric current is about 18·5, while for acids, salts,
and such like substances whose solutions do conduct electricity, it is <i>i</i> times greater; for
instance, for HCl, KI, HNO<sub>3</sub>, KHO, &amp;c., about 36 (<i>i</i> is nearly 2), for borax about 66, and
so on where <i>i</i> varies in the same manner as it does in the case of the osmotic pressure of
solutions (Note <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>). (4) Different solvents (water, acetic acid, benzene, &amp;c.) have each
their corresponding constants of molecular depression (which have a certain remote
connection with their molecular weight); for example, for acetic acid the molecular
depression is about 39 and not 19 (as it is for water), for benzene 49, for methyl alcohol
about 17, &amp;c. (5) If the molecular weight M of a substance be unknown, then in the
case of non-conductors of electricity or for a given group, it may be found by determining
the depression, <i>d</i>, for a given concentration, <i>p</i>; for example, in the case of peroxide of
hydrogen, which is a non-conductor of electricity, the molecular weight, M, was found to
be nearly 34, <i>i.e.</i> equal to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Similar results have also been found for the fall in the vapour tension of solutions
(Note <a href="#Footnote_51_98">51</a>), and for the rise of their boiling points (hence these data may also serve for
determining the molecular weight of a substance in solution, as is shortly described in
Chapter VII., Note <a href="#Footnote_27_BIS_437">27 bis</a>). And as these conclusions are also applicable in the case of
osmotic pressure (Note <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>), and a variation in the magnitude of <i>i</i>, in passing from solutions
which do not conduct an electric current to those which do conduct electricity is
everywhere remarked, so it was natural to here seek that causal connection which Arrhenius
(1888), Ostwald, and others expected to find in the supposition that a portion of
the substance of the electrolyte is already decomposed in the very act of solution, into
its ions (for example, NaCl into Na and Cl), or into the atoms of those individual substances
which make their appearance in electrolysis, and in this way to explain the fact
that <i>i</i> is greater for those bodies which conduct an electric current. We will not consider
here this supposition, known as the hypothesis of &lsquo;electrolytic dissociation,&rsquo; not only
because it wholly belongs to that special branch&mdash;physical chemistry, and gives scarcely
any help towards explaining the chemical relations of solutions (particularly their passage
into definite compounds, their reactions, and their very formation), but also because&mdash;(1)
all the above data (for constant depression, osmotic pressure, &amp;c.) only refer to dilute
solutions, and are not applicable to strong solutions; whilst the chemical interest in
strong solutions is not less than in dilute solutions, and the transition from the former
into the latter is consecutive and inevitable; (2) because in all homogeneous bodies
(although it may be insoluble and not an electrolyte) a portion of the atoms may he
supposed (Clausius) to be passing from one particle to another (Chapter X., Note <a href="#Footnote_28_600">28</a>),
and as it were dissociated, but there are no reasons for believing that such a phenomenon
is proper to the solutions of electrolytes only; (3) because no essential mark of difference
is observed between the solution of electrolytes and non-conductors, although it might be
expected there would be according to Arrhenius' hypothesis; (4) because it is most
reasonable to suppose the formation of new, more complex, but unstable and easily dissociated
compounds in the act of solution, than a decomposition, even partial, of the
substances taken; (5) because if Arrhenius' hypothesis be accepted it becomes necessary
to admit the existence in solutions of free ions, like the atoms Cl or Na, without any
apparent expenditure of the energy necessary for their disruption, and if in this case it
can be explained why <i>i</i> then = 2, it is not at all clear why solutions of MgSO<sub>4</sub> give <i>i</i> = 1,
although the solution does conduct an electric current; (6) because in dilute solutions,
the approximative proportionality between the depression and concentration may be
recognised, while admitting the formation of hydrates, with as much right as in admitting
the solution of anhydrous substances, and if the formation of hydrates be recognised it
is easier to admit that a portion of these hydrates is decomposed than to accept the
breaking-up into ions; (7) because the best conductors of electricity are solutions like the
sulphates in which it is necessary to recognise the formation of associated systems or
hydrates; (8) because the cause of electro-conductivity can be sooner looked for in this
affinity and this combination of the substance dissolved with the solvent, as is seen from
the fact, that (D. P. Konovaloff) neither aniline nor acetic acid alone conduct an electric
current, a solution of aniline in water conducts it badly (and here the affinity is very
small), while a solution of aniline in acetic acid forms a good electrolyte, in which, without
doubt, chemical forces are acting, bringing aniline, like ammonia, into combination with
the acetic acid; which is evident from the researches made by Prof. Konovaloff upon
mixtures (solutions) of aniline and other amines; and, lastly, (9) because I, together with
many of the chemists of the present day, cannot regard the hypothesis of electrolytic
dissociation in the form given to it up to now by Arrhenius and Ostwald, as answering
to the sum total of the chemical data respecting solutions and dissociation in general.
Thus, although I consider it superfluous to discuss further the evolution of the above
theory of solutions, still I think that it would he most useful for students of chemistry to
consider all the data referring to this subject, which can be found in the <i>Zeitschrift für
physikalische Chemie</i>, 1888&ndash;1894.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_97" id="Footnote_50_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_97"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> This fact, which was established by Gay-Lussac, Pierson, and v. Babo, is confirmed
by the latest observations, and enables us to express not only the fall of tension (<i>p</i> - <i>p</i>&#8242;)
itself, but its ratio to the tension of water

(<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>p</i> - <i>p</i>&#8242;</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>p</i></span>
</span>).

It is to be remarked that in the
absence of any chemical action, the fall of pressure is either very small, or does not
exist at all (note <a href="#Footnote_33_80">33</a>), and is not proportional to the quantity of the substance added. As
a rule, the tension is then equal, according to the law of Dalton, to the sum of the
tensions of the substances taken. Hence liquids which are insoluble in each other (for
example, water and chloride of carbon) present a tension equal to the sum of their individual
tensions, and therefore such a mixture boils at a lower temperature than the more
volatile liquid (Magnus, Regnault).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_98" id="Footnote_51_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_98"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> If, in the example of common salt, the fall of tension be divided by the tension of
water, a figure is obtained which is nearly 105 times less than the magnitude of the fall
of temperature of formation of ice. This correlation was theoretically deduced by Goldberg,
on the basis of the application of the mechanical theory of heat, and is repeated by
many investigated solutions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_99" id="Footnote_52_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_99"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> Fritzsche showed that solutions of certain colouring matters yield colourless ice,
which clearly proves the passage of water only into a solid state, without any intermixture
of the substance dissolved, although the possibility of the admixture in certain other
cases cannot be denied.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_100" id="Footnote_53_100"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_100"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> As the solubility of certain substances (for example, coniine, cerium sulphate, and
others) decreases with a rise of temperature (between certain limits&mdash;see, for example,
note 24), so these substances do not separate from their saturated solutions on cooling
but on heating. Thus a solution of manganese sulphate, saturated at 70°, becomes cloudy
on further heating. The point at which a substance separates from its solution with a
change of temperature gives an easy means of determining the co-efficient of solubility,
and this was taken advantage of by Prof. Alexéeff for determining the solubility of many
substances. The phenomenon and method of observation are here essentially the same
as in the determination of the temperature of formation of ice. If a solution of a substance
which separates out on heating be taken (for example, the sulphate of calcium
or manganese), then at a certain fall of temperature ice will separate out from it, and at
a certain rise of temperature the salt will separate out. From this example, and from
general considerations, it is clear that the separation of a substance dissolved from a
solution should present a certain analogy to the separation of ice from a solution. In
both cases, a heterogeneous system of a solid and a liquid is formed from a homogeneous
(liquid) system.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_101" id="Footnote_54_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_101"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Those salts which separate out with water of crystallisation and give several
crystallohydrates form supersaturated solutions with the greatest facility, and the phenomenon
is much more common than was previously imagined. The first data were
given in the last century by Loewitz, in St. Petersburg. Numerous researches have
proved that supersaturated solutions do not differ from ordinary solutions in any of their
essential properties. The variations in specific gravity, vapour tension, formation of ice,
&amp;c., take place according to the ordinary laws.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_102" id="Footnote_55_102"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_102"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Inasmuch as air, as has been shown by direct experiment, contains, although in
very small quantities, minute crystals of salts, and among them sodium sulphate, air can
bring about the crystallisation of a supersaturated solution of sodium sulphate in an open
vessel, but it has no effect on saturated solutions of certain other salts; for example, lead
acetate. According to the observations of De Boisbaudran, Gernez, and others, isomorphous
salts (analogous in composition) are capable of inducing crystallisation. Thus, a
supersaturated solution of nickel sulphate crystallises by contact with crystals of sulphates
of other metals analogous to it, such as those of magnesium, cobalt, copper, and
manganese. The crystallisation of a supersaturated solution, set up by the contact of
a minute crystal, starts from it in rays with a definite velocity, and it is evident that
the crystals as they form propagate the crystallisation in definite directions. This
phenomenon recalls the evolution of organisms from germs. An attraction of similar
molecules ensues, and they dispose themselves in definite similar forms.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_103" id="Footnote_56_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_103"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> At the present time a view is very generally accepted, which regards supersaturated
solutions as homogeneous systems, which pass into heterogeneous systems (composed of
a liquid and a solid substance), in all respects exactly resembling the passage of water
cooled below its freezing point into ice and water, or the passage of crystals of rhombic
sulphur into monoclinic crystals, and of the monoclinic crystals into rhombic. Although
many phenomena of supersaturation are thus clearly understood, yet the spontaneous formation
of the unstable hepta-hydrated salt (with 7H<sub>2</sub>O), in the place of the more stable
deca-hydrated salt (with mol. 10H<sub>2</sub>O), indicates a property of a saturated solution of
sodium sulphate which obliges one to admit that it has a different structure from an
ordinary solution. Stcherbacheff asserts, on the basis of his researches, that a solution
of the deca-hydrated salt gives, on evaporation, without the aid of heat, the deca-hydrated
salt, whilst after heating above 33° it forms a supersaturated solution and the hepta-hydrated
salt. But in order that this view should be accepted, some facts must be discovered
distinguishing solutions (which are, according to this view, isomeric) containing
the hepta-hydrated salt from those containing the deca-hydrated salt, and all efforts in this
direction (the study of the properties of the solutions) have given negative results. As
some crystallohydrates of salts (alums, sugar of lead, calcium chloride) melt straightway
(without separating out anything), whilst others (like Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O) are broken up,
then it may be that the latter are only in a state of equilibrium at a higher temperature
than their melting point. It may here be observed that in melting crystals of the deca-hydrated
salt, there is formed, besides the solid anhydrous salt, a saturated solution
giving the hepta-hydrated salt, so that this passage from the deca-to the hepta-hydrated
salt, and the reverse, takes place with the formation of the anhydrous (or, it may be,
monohydrated) salt.</p>

<p>Moreover, supersaturation (Potilitzin, 1889) only takes place with those substances
which are capable of giving several modifications or several crystallohydrates, <i>i.e.</i> supersaturated
solutions separate out, besides the stable normal crystallohydrate, hydrates
containing less water and also the anhydrous salt. This degree of saturation acts upon
the substance dissolved in a like manner to heat. Sulphate of nickel in a solution at
15° to 20° separates out rhombic crystals with 7H<sub>2</sub>O, at 30° to 40° cubical crystals, with
6H<sub>2</sub>O, at 50° to 70° monoclinic crystals, also containing 6H<sub>2</sub>O. Crystals of the same
composition separate out from supersaturated solutions at one temperature (17° to 19°),
but at different degrees of saturation, as was shown by Lecoq de Boisbaudran. The
capacity to voluntarily separate out slightly hydrated or anhydrous salts by the introduction
of a crystal into the solution is common to all supersaturated solutions. If a
salt forms a supersaturated solution, then one would expect, according to this view, that
it should exist in the form of several hydrates or in several modifications. Thus
Potilitzin concluded that chlorate of strontium, which easily gives supersaturated solutions,
should be capable of forming several hydrates, besides the anhydrous salt known;
and he succeeded in discovering the existence of two hydrates, Sr(ClO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O and
apparently Sr(ClO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O. Besides this, three modifications of the common anhydrous
salt were obtained, differing from each other in their crystalline form. One modification
separated out in the form of rhombic octahedra, another in oblique plates, and a third
in long brittle prisms or plates. Further researches showed that salts which are not
capable of forming supersaturated solutions such as the bromates of calcium, strontium,
and barium, part with their water of hydration with difficulty (they crystallise with
1H<sub>2</sub>O), and decompose very slowly in a vacuum or in dry air. In other words the
tension of dissociation is very small in this class of hydrates. As the hydrates characterised
by a small dissociation tension are incapable of giving supersaturated solutions,
so conversely supersaturated solutions give hydrates whose tension of dissociation is
great (Potilitzin, 1893).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_57_104" id="Footnote_57_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_104"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> <i>Emulsions</i>, like milk, are composed of a solution of glutinous or similar substances,
or of oily liquids suspended in a liquid in the form of drops, which are clearly visible
under a microscope, and form an example of a mechanical formation which resembles
solution. But the difference from solutions is here evident. There are, however,
solutions which approach very near to emulsions in the facility with which the substance
dissolved separates from them. It has long been known, for example, that a particular
kind of Prussian blue, KFe<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub>, dissolves in pure water, but, on the addition of the
smallest quantity of either of a number of salts, it coagulates and becomes quite insoluble.
If copper sulphide (CuS), cadmium sulphide (CdS), arsenic sulphide (As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub>)
(the experiments with these substances proceed with great ease, and the solution obtained
is comparatively stable), and many other metallic sulphides, be obtained by a
method of double decomposition (by precipitating salts of these metals by hydrogen
sulphide), and be then carefully washed (by allowing the precipitate to settle, pouring off
the liquid, and again adding sulphuretted hydrogen water), then, as was shown by
Schulze, Spring, Prost, and others, the previously insoluble sulphides pass into transparent
(for mercury, lead, and silver, reddish brown; for copper and iron, greenish
brown; for cadmium and indium, yellow; and for zinc, colourless) solutions, which may
be preserved (the weaker they are the longer they keep) and even boiled, but which,
nevertheless, in time coagulate&mdash;that is, separate in an insoluble form, and then sometimes
become crystalline and quite incapable of re-dissolving. Graham and others
observed the power shown by colloids (<i>see</i> note <a href="#Footnote_18_65">18</a>) of forming similar <i>hydrosols or solutions
of gelatinous colloids</i>, and, in describing alumina and silica, we shall again have
occasion to speak of such solutions.</p>

<p>In the existing state of our knowledge concerning solution, such solutions may be
looked on as a transition between emulsion and ordinary solutions, but no fundamental
judgment can be formed about them until a study has been made of their relations to
ordinary solutions (the solutions of even soluble colloids freeze immediately on cooling
below 0°, and, according to Guthrie, do not form cryohydrates), and to supersaturated
solutions, with which they have certain points in common.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_58_105" id="Footnote_58_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_58_105"><span class="label">[58]</span></a> Offer (1880) concludes, from his researches on cryohydrates, that they are simple
mixtures of ice and salts, having a constant melting point, just as there are alloys having
a constant point of fusion, and solutions of liquids with a constant boiling point (<i>see</i> note
<a href="#Footnote_60_107">60</a>). This does not, however, explain in what form a salt is contained, for instance, in the
cryohydrate NaCl + 10H<sub>2</sub>O. At temperatures above -10° common salt separates out in
anhydrous crystals, and at temperatures near -10°, in combination with water of
crystallisation, NaCl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O, and, therefore, it is very improbable that at still lower
temperatures it would separate without water. If the possibility of the solidified cryohydrate
containing NaCl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O and ice be admitted, then it is not clear why one of
these substances does not melt before the other. If alcohol does not extract water from
the solid mass, leaving the salt behind, this does not prove the presence of ice, because
alcohol also takes up water from the crystals of many hydrated substances (for instance,
from NaCl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O) at about their melting-points. Besides which, a simple observation
on the cryohydrate, NaCl + 10H<sub>2</sub>O, shows that with the most careful cooling it does not
on the addition of ice deposit ice, which would occur if ice were formed on solidification
intermixed with the salt.</p>

<p>I may add with regard to cryohydrates that many of the solutions of acids solidify
completely on prolonged cooling (for example, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O), and then form perfectly
definite compounds. For the solutions of sulphuric acid (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>.) Pickering
obtained, for instance, a hydrate, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O at -25°. Hydrochloric, nitric, and other
acids also give similar crystalline hydrates, melting at low temperatures and presenting
many similarities with the cryohydrates.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_106" id="Footnote_59_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_106"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> <i>See</i> note <a href="#Footnote_24_71">24</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_107" id="Footnote_60_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_107"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> For this reason (the want of entire constancy of the composition of constant boiling
solutions with a change of pressure), the existence of definite hydrates formed by
volatile substances&mdash;for instance, by hydrochloric acid and water&mdash;is frequently denied.
It is generally argued as follows: If there did exist a constancy of composition, then it
would be unaltered by a change of pressure. But the distillation of constant boiling
hydrates is undoubtedly accompanied (judging by the vapour densities determined by
Bineau), like the distillation of sal ammoniac, sulphuric acid, &amp;c., by a complete decomposition
of the original compound&mdash;that is, these substances do not exist in a state of
vapour, but their products of decomposition (hydrochloric acid and water) are gases at
the temperature of volatilisation, which dissolve in the volatilised and condensed liquids;
but the solubility of gases in liquids depends on the pressure, and, therefore, the composition
of constant boiling solutions may, and even ought to, vary with a change of
pressure, and, further, the smaller the pressure and the lower the temperature of volatilisation,
the more likely is a true compound to be obtained. According to the researches
of Roscoe and Dittmar (1859), the constant boiling solution of hydrochloric acid proved
to contain 18 p.c. of hydrochloric acid at a pressure of 3 atmospheres, 20 p.c. at 1 atmosphere,
and 23 p.c. at <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>10</sub> of an atmosphere. On passing air through the solution until
its composition became constant (<i>i.e.</i> forcing the excess of aqueous vapour or of hydrochloric
acid to pass away with the air), then acid was obtained containing about
20 p.c. at 100°, about 23 p.c. at 50°, and about 25 p.c. at 0°. From this it is seen that
by decreasing the pressure and lowering the temperature of evaporation one arrives
at the same limit, where the composition should be taken as HCl + 6H<sub>2</sub>O, which requires
25·26 p.c. of hydrochloric acid. Fuming hydrochloric acid contains more than this.</p>

<p>In the case already considered, as in the case of formic acid in the researches of
D. P. Konovaloff (note <a href="#Footnote_47_94">47</a>), the constant boiling solution corresponds with a minimum
tension&mdash;that is, with a boiling point higher than that of either of the component
elements. But there is another case of constant boiling solutions similar to the case of
the solution of propyl alcohol, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O, when a solution, undecomposed by distillation,
boils at a lower point than that of the more volatile liquid. However, in this case also,
if there be solution, the possibility of the formation of a definite compound in the form
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O cannot be denied, and the tension of the solution is not equal to the sum
of tensions of the components. There are possible cases of constant boiling mixtures
even when there is no solution nor any loss of tension, and consequently no chemical
action, since the amount of liquids that are volatilised is determined by the product of
the vapour densities into their vapour tensions (Wanklyn), in consequence of which
liquids whose boiling point is above 100°&mdash;for instance, turpentine and ethereal oils in
general&mdash;when distilled with aqueous vapour, pass over at a temperature below 100°.
Consequently, it is not in the constancy of composition and boiling point (temperature of
decomposition) that evidence of a distinct chemical action is to be found in the above-described
solutions of acids, but in the great loss of tension, which completely resembles
the loss of tension observed, for instance, in the perfectly-definite combinations of substances
with water of crystallisation (see later, note <a href="#Footnote_65_112">65</a>). Sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, as we
shall learn later, is also decomposed by distillation, like HCl + 6H<sub>2</sub>O, and exhibits, moreover,
all the signs of a definite chemical compound. The study of the variation of the
specific gravities of solutions as dependent on their composition (see note <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>) shows that
phenomena of a similar kind, although of different dimensions, take place in the formation
of both H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> from H<sub>2</sub>O and SO<sub>3</sub>, and of HCl + 6H<sub>2</sub>O (or of aqueous solutions
analogous to it) from HCl and H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61_108" id="Footnote_61_108"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_108"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> The essence of the matter may he thus represented. A gaseous or easily volatile
substance <i>A</i> forms with a certain quantity of water, <i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, a definite complex compound
<i>An</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, which is stable up to a temperature t° higher than 100°. At this temperature
it is decomposed into two substances, <i>A</i> + H<sub>2</sub>O. Both boil below <i>t</i>° at the ordinary
pressure, and therefore at <i>t</i>° they distil over and re-combine in the receiver. But if a
part of the substance <i>An</i>H<sub>2</sub>O is decomposed or volatilised, a portion of the undecomposed
liquid still remains in the vessel, which can partially dissolve one of the products of
decomposition, and that in quantity varying with the pressure and temperature, and
therefore the solution at a constant boiling point will have a slightly different composition
at different pressures.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62_109" id="Footnote_62_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_109"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> For solutions of hydrochloric acid in water there are still greater differences in
reactions. For instance, strong solutions decompose antimony sulphide (forming hydrogen
sulphide, H<sub>2</sub>S), and precipitate common salt from its solutions, whilst weak solutions
do not act thus.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_63_110" id="Footnote_63_110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_110"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> Supersaturated solutions give an excellent proof in this respect. Thus a solution
of copper sulphate generally crystallises in penta-hydrated crystals, CuSO<sub>4</sub> + 5H<sub>2</sub>O, and
its saturated solution gives such crystals if it be brought into contact with the minutest
possible crystal of the same kind. But, according to the observations of Lecoq de Boisbaudran,
if a crystal of ferrous sulphate (an isomorphous salt, <i>see</i> note <a href="#Footnote_55_102">55</a>), FeSO<sub>4</sub> + 7H<sub>2</sub>O,
be placed in a saturated solution of copper sulphate, then crystals of hepta-hydrated salt,
CuSO<sub>4</sub> + 7H<sub>2</sub>O, are obtained. It is evident that neither the penta- nor the hepta-hydrated
salt is contained as such in the solution. The solution presents its own particular liquid
form of equilibrium.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_64_111" id="Footnote_64_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_111"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> Efflorescence, like every evaporation, proceeds from the surface. In the interior of
crystals which have effloresced there is usually found a non-effloresced mass, so that the
majority of effloresced crystals of washing soda show, in their fracture, a transparent
nucleus coated by an effloresced, opaque, powdery mass. It is a remarkable circumstance
in this respect that efflorescence proceeds in a completely regular and uniform manner,
so that the angles and planes of similar crystallographic character effloresce simultaneously,
and in this respect the crystalline form determines those parts of crystals
where efflorescence starts, and the order in which it continues. In solutions evaporation
also proceeds from the surface, and the first crystals which appear on its reaching the
required degree of saturation are also formed at the surface. After falling to the bottom
the crystals naturally continue to grow (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>.).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65_112" id="Footnote_65_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_112"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> According to Lesc&oelig;ur (1883), at 100° a concentrated solution of barium hydroxide,
BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, on first depositing crystals (with + H<sub>2</sub>O) has a tension of about 630 mm.
(instead of 760 mm., the tension of water), which decreases (because the solution evaporates)
to 45 mm., when all the water is expelled from the crystals, BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O, which
are formed, but they also lose water (dissociate, effloresce at 100°), leaving the hydroxide,
BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is perfectly undecomposable at 100°&mdash;that is, does not part with water.
At 73° (the tension of water is then 265 mm.) a solution, containing 33H<sub>2</sub>O, on crystallising
has a tension of 230 mm.; the crystals, BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O, which separate out, have a
tension of 160 mm.; on losing water they give BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. This substance does not
decompose at 73°, and therefore its tension = 0. In those crystallohydrates which
effloresce at the ordinary temperature, the tension of dissociation nearly approximates to
that of the aqueous vapour, as Lesc&oelig;ur (1891) showed. To this category of compounds
belong B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>(3 + <i>x</i>)H<sub>2</sub>O, C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>(2 + <i>x</i>)H<sub>2</sub>O, BaO(9 + <i>x</i>)H<sub>2</sub>O, and SrO(9 + <i>x</i>)H<sub>2</sub>O. And
a still greater tension is possessed by Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>10H<sub>2</sub>O, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>10H<sub>2</sub>O, and MgSO<sub>4</sub>(7 + <i>x</i>)H<sub>2</sub>O.
Müller-Erzbach (1884) determines the tension (with reference to liquid water) by
placing tubes of the same length with water and the substances experimented with in a
desiccator, the rate of loss of water giving the relative tension. Thus, at the ordinary
temperature, crystals of sodium phosphate, Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> + 12H<sub>2</sub>O, present a tension of 0·7
compared with water, until they lose 5H<sub>2</sub>O, then 0·4 until they lose 5H<sub>2</sub>O more, and on
losing the last equivalent of water the tension falls to 0·04 compared with water. It is
clear that the different molecules of water are held by an unequal force. Out of the five
molecules of water in copper sulphate the two first are comparatively easily separated
even at the ordinary temperature (but only after several days in a desiccator, according
to Latchinoff); the next two are more difficultly separated, and the last equivalent is
retained even at 100°. This is another indication of the capacity of CuSO<sub>4</sub> to form three
hydrates, CuSO<sub>4</sub>5H<sub>2</sub>O, CuSO<sub>4</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O, and CuSO<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O. The researches of Andreae on the
tension of dissociation of hydrated sulphate of copper showed (1891) the existence of
three provinces, characterised at a given temperature by a constant tension: (1) between
3&ndash;5, (2) between 1&ndash;3, and lastly (3) between 0&ndash;1 molecule of water, which again confirms
the existence of three hydrates of the above composition for this salt.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65_BIS_113" id="Footnote_65_BIS_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_BIS_113"><span class="label">[65 bis]</span></a> Sodium acetate (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Na,3H<sub>2</sub>O) melts at 58°, but re-solidifies only on contact
with a crystal, otherwise it may remain liquid even at 0°, and may be used for obtaining
a constant temperature. According to Jeannel, the latent heat of fusion is about 28
calories, and according to Pickering the heat of solution 35 calories. When melted this
salt boils at 123°&mdash;that is, the tension of the vapour given off at that temperature equals
the atmospheric pressure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_66_114" id="Footnote_66_114"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_114"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> Such a phenomenon frequently presents itself in purely chemical action. For
instance, let a liquid substance <i>A</i> give, with another liquid substance <i>B</i>, under the conditions
of an experiment, a mere minute quantity of a solid or gaseous substance <i>C</i>. This
small quantity will separate out (pass away from the sphere of action, as Berthollet
expressed it), and the remaining masses of <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> will again give <i>C</i>; consequently,
under these conditions action will go on to the end. Such, it seems to me, is the action
in solutions when they yield ice or vapour indicating the presence of water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_67_115" id="Footnote_67_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_115"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> Certain substances are capable of forming together only one compound, others
several, and these of the most varied degrees of stability. The compounds of water are
instances of this kind. In solutions the existence of several different definite compounds
must be acknowledged, but many of these have not yet been obtained in a free state, and
it may be that they cannot be obtained in any other but a liquid form&mdash;that is, dissolved;
just as there are many undoubted definite compounds which only exist in one physical
state. Among the hydrates such instances occur. The compound CO<sub>2</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O (<i>see</i> note
<a href="#Footnote_31_78">31</a>), according to Wroblewski, only occurs in a solid form. Hydrates like H<sub>2</sub>S + 12H<sub>2</sub>O
(De Forcrand and Villard), HBr + H<sub>2</sub>O (Roozeboom), can only be accepted on the basis
of a decrease of tension, but present themselves as very transient substances, incapable
of existing in a stable free state. Even sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, itself, which undoubtedly
is a definite compound, fumes in a liquid form, giving off the anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, it
exhibits a very unstable equilibrium. The crystallo-hydrates of chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O,
of hydrogen sulphide, H<sub>2</sub>S + 12H<sub>2</sub>O (it is formed at 0°, and is completely decomposed at
+1°, as then 1 vol. of water only dissolves 4 vols. of hydrogen sulphide, while at 0·1° it
dissolves about 100 vols.), and of many other gases, are instances of hydrates which are
very unstable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_68_116" id="Footnote_68_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_116"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> Of such a kind are also other indefinite chemical compounds; for example,
metallic alloys. These are solid substances or solidified solutions of metals. They also
contain definite compounds, and may contain an excess of one of the metals. According
to the experiments of Laurie (1888), the alloys of zinc with copper in respect to the electro-motive
force in galvanic batteries behave just like zinc if the proportion of copper in
the alloy does not exceed a certain percentage&mdash;that is, until a definite compound is
attained&mdash;for in that case particles of free zinc are present; but if a copper surface be
taken, and it be covered by only one-thousandth part of its area of zinc, then only the
zinc will act in a galvanic battery.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_69_117" id="Footnote_69_117"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_117"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> According to the above supposition, the condition of solutions in the sense of the
kinetic hypothesis of matter (that is, on the supposition of an internal motion of
molecules and atoms) may be represented in the following form:&mdash;In a homogeneous
liquid&mdash;for instance, water&mdash;the molecules occur in a certain state of, although mobile,
still stable, equilibrium. When a substance <i>A</i> dissolves in water, its molecules form with
several molecules of water, systems <i>An</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, which are so unstable that when surrounded
by molecules of water they decompose and re-form, so that <i>A</i> passes from one mass of
molecules of water to another, and the molecules of water which were at this moment in
harmonious motion with <i>A</i> in the form of the system <i>An</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, in the next instant
may have already succeeded in getting free. The addition of water or of molecules of <i>A</i>
may either only alter the number of free molecules, which in their turn enter into systems
<i>An</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, or they may introduce conditions for the possibility of building up new systems
<i>Am</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, where <i>m</i> is either greater or less than <i>n</i>. If in the solution the relation of the
molecules be the same as in the system <i>Am</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, then the addition of fresh molecules of
water or of <i>A</i> would be followed by the formation of new molecules <i>An</i>H<sub>2</sub>O. The relative
quantity, stability, and composition of these systems or definite compounds will vary in
one or another solution. I adopted this view of solutions (1887, Pickering subsequently
put forward a similar view) after a most intimate study of the variation of their specific
gravities, to which my book, cited in note <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>, is devoted. Definite compounds, <i>An</i><sub>1</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O
and <i>Am</i><sub>1</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, existing in a free&mdash;for instance, solid&mdash;form, may in certain cases be held
in solutions in a dissociated state (although but partially); they are similar in their
structure to those definite substances which are formed in solutions, but it is not necessary
to assume that such systems as Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 10H<sub>2</sub>O, or Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 7H<sub>2</sub>O, or Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, are contained
in solutions. The comparatively more stable systems <i>An</i><sub>1</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O which exist in a
free state and change their physical state must present, although within certain limits
of temperature, an entirely harmonious kind of motion of <i>A</i> with <i>n</i><sub>1</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O; the property
also and state of systems <i>An</i>H<sub>2</sub>O and <i>Am</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, occurring in solutions, is that they are
in a liquid form, although partially dissociated. Substances <i>A</i><sub>1</sub>, which give solutions,
are distinguished by the fact that they can form such unstable systems <i>An</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, but
besides them they can give other much more stable systems <i>An</i><sub>1</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O. Thus ethylene,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, in dissolving in water, probably forms a system C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub><i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O, which easily splits up
into C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, but it also gives the system of alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, which
is comparatively stable. Thus oxygen can dissolve in water, and it can combine with it,
forming peroxide of hydrogen. Turpentine, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>, does not dissolve in water, but it
combines with it as a comparatively stable hydrate. In other words, the chemical structure
of hydrates, or of the definite compounds which are contained in solutions, is distinguished
not only by its original peculiarities but also by a diversity of stability. A
similar structure to hydrates must be acknowledged in crystallo-hydrates. On melting
they give actual (real) solutions. As substances which give crystallo-hydrates, like salts,
are capable of forming a number of diverse hydrates, and as the greater the number of
molecules of water (<i>n</i>) they (<i>An</i>H<sub>2</sub>O) contain, the lower is the temperature of their
formation, and as the more easily they decompose the more water they hold, therefore,
in the first place, the isolation of hydrates holding much water existing in aqueous solutions
may be soonest looked for at low temperatures (although, perhaps, in certain cases
they cannot exist in the solid state); and, secondly, the stability also of such higher
hydrates will be at a minimum under the ordinary circumstances of the occurrence of
liquid water. Hence a further more detailed investigation of cryohydrates may help to
the elucidation of the nature of solutions. But it may be foreseen that certain cryohydrates
will, like metallic alloys, present solidified mixtures of ice with the salts themselves
and their more stable hydrates, and others will be definite compounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_70_118" id="Footnote_70_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_70_118"><span class="label">[70]</span></a> The above representation of solutions, &amp;c., considering them as a particular state
of definite compounds, excludes the independent existence of indefinite compounds;
by this means that unity of chemical conception is obtained which cannot be arrived
at by admitting the physico-mechanical conception of indefinite compounds. The
gradual transition from typical solutions (as of gases in water, and of weak saline
solutions) to sulphuric acid, and from it and its definite, but yet unstable and liquid,
compounds, to clearly defined compounds, such as salts and their crystallo-hydrates,
is so imperceptible, that in denying that solutions pertain to the number of definite
but dissociating compounds, we risk denying the definiteness of the atomic composition
of such substances as sulphuric acid or of molten crystallo-hydrates. I
repeat, however, that for the present the theory of solutions cannot be considered as
firmly established. The above opinion about them is nothing more than a hypothesis
which endeavours to satisfy those comparatively limited data which we have for the
present about solutions, and of those cases of their transition into definite compounds.
By submitting solutions to the Daltonic conception of atomism, I hope that we may not
only attain to a general harmonious chemical doctrine, but also that new motives for
investigation and research will appear in the problem of solutions, which must either
confirm the proposed theory or replace it by another fuller and truer one; and I for my
part cannot consider this to be the case with any of the other present doctrines of solutions
(note <a href="#Footnote_49_96">49</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_71_119" id="Footnote_71_119"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_119"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> In combining with water one part by weight of lime evolves 245 units of heat. A
high temperature is obtained, because the specific heat of the resulting product is small.
Sodium oxide, Na<sub>2</sub>O, in reacting on water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and forming caustic soda (sodium
hydroxide), NaHO, evolves 552 units of heat for each part by weight of sodium oxide.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_72_120" id="Footnote_72_120"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_120"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> The diagram given in note <a href="#Footnote_28_75">28</a> shows the evolution of heat on the mixture of
sulphuric acid, or monohydrate (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, <i>i.e.</i> SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O), with different quantities of water
per 100 vols. of the resultant solution. Every 98 grams of sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) evolve,
on the addition of 18 grams of water, 6,379 units of heat; with twice or three times the
quantity of water 9,418 and 11,137 units of heat, and with an infinitely large quantity of
water 17,860 units of heat, according to the determinations of Thomsen. He also showed
that when H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is formed from SO<sub>3</sub> (= 80) and H<sub>2</sub>O (= 18), 21,308 units of heat are
evolved per 98 parts by weight of the resultant sulphuric acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_73_121" id="Footnote_73_121"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_121"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> Thus, for different hydrates the stability with which they hold water is very dissimilar.
Certain hydrates hold water very loosely, and in combining with it evolve little
heat. From other hydrates the water cannot be separated by any degree of heat, even
if they are formed from anhydrides (<i>i.e.</i> anhydrous substances) and water with little
evolution of heat; for instance, acetic anhydride in combining with water evolves an
inconsiderable amount of heat, but the water cannot then be expelled from it. If the
hydrate (acetic acid) formed by this combination be strongly heated it either volatilises
without change, or decomposes into new substances, but it does not again yield the original
substances&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the anhydride and water, at least in a liquid form. Here is an
instance which gives the reason for calling the water entering into the composition of the
hydrate, water of constitution. Such, for example, is the water entering into the so-called
caustic soda or sodium hydroxide (<i>see</i> note <a href="#Footnote_71_119">71</a>). But there are hydrates which
easily part with their water; yet this water cannot be considered as water of crystallisation,
not only because sometimes such hydrates have no crystalline form, but also because,
in perfectly analogous cases, very stable hydrates are formed, which are capable of particular
kinds of chemical reactions, as we shall subsequently learn. Such, for example, is
the unstable hydrated oxide of copper, which is not formed from water and oxide of
copper, but which is obtained just like far more stable hydrates, for example, the hydrated
oxide of barium BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> equal to BaO + H<sub>2</sub>O, by the double decomposition of the solution
of salts with alkalies. In a word, there is no distinct boundary either between the water
of hydrates and of crystallisation, or between solution and hydration.</p>

<p>It must be observed that in separating from an aqueous solution, many substances,
without having a crystalline form, hold water in the same unstable state as in crystals;
only this water cannot be termed &lsquo;water of crystallisation&rsquo; if the substance which
separates out has no crystalline form. The hydrates of alumina and silica are examples
of such unstable hydrates. If these substances are separated from an aqueous solution
by a chemical process, then they always contain water. The formation of a new chemical
compound containing water is here particularly evident, for alumina and silica in an
anhydrous state have chemical properties differing from those they show when combined
with water, and do not combine directly with it. The entire series of colloids on separating
from water form similar compounds with it, which have the aspect of solid gelatinous
substances. Water is held in a considerable quantity in solidified glue or boiled albumin.
It cannot be expelled from them by pressure; hence, in this case there has ensued some
kind of combination of the substance with water. This water, however, is easily separated
on drying; but not the whole of it, a portion being retained, and this portion is considered
to belong to the hydrate, although in this case it is very difficult, if not impossible, to
obtain definite compounds. The absence of any distinct boundary lines between solutions,
crystallo-hydrates, and ordinary hydrates above referred to, is very clearly seen in
such examples.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE COMPOSITION OF WATER, HYDROGEN</span></h2>

<p>The question now arises, Is not <i>water</i> itself a <i>compound substance</i>?
Cannot it be formed by the mutual combination of some component
parts? Cannot it be broken up into its component parts? There cannot
be the least doubt that if it does split up, and if it is a compound,
then it is a <i>definite</i> one characterised by the stability of the union
between those component parts from which it is formed. From the
fact alone that water passes into all physical states as a homogeneous
whole, without in the least varying chemically in its properties and
without splitting up into its component parts (neither solutions nor
many hydrates can be distilled&mdash;they are split up), we must conclude,
from this fact alone, that if water is a compound then it is a stable and
definite chemical compound capable of entering into many other combinations.
Like many other great discoveries in the province of
chemistry, it is to the end of the last century that we are indebted
for the important discovery that water is not a simple substance, that
it is composed of two substances like a number of other compound
substances. This was proved by two of the methods by which the compound
nature of bodies may be directly determined; by analysis
and by synthesis&mdash;that is, by a method of the decomposition of water
into, and of the formation of water from, its component parts. In 1781
Cavendish first obtained water by burning hydrogen in oxygen, both of
which gases were already known to him. He concluded from this that
water was composed of two substances. But he did not make more
accurate experiments, which would have shown the relative quantities
of the component parts in water, and which would have determined its
complex nature with certainty. Although his experiments were the
first, and although the conclusion he drew from them was true, yet such
novel ideas as the complex nature of water are not easily recognised so
long as there is no series of researches which entirely and indubitably
proves the truth of such a conclusion. The fundamental experiments
which proved the complexity of water by the method of synthesis, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of its formation from other substances, were made in 1789 by Monge,
Lavoisier, Fourcroy, and Vauquelin. They obtained four ounces of
water by burning hydrogen, and found that water consists of 15 parts
of hydrogen and 85 parts of oxygen. It was also proved that the
weight of water formed was equal to the sum of the weights of the
component parts entering into its composition; consequently, water contains
all the matter entering into oxygen and hydrogen. The complexity
of water was proved in this manner by a method of synthesis.
But we will turn to its analysis&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to its decomposition into its component
parts. The analysis may be more or less complete. Either
both component parts may be obtained in a separate state, or else
only one is separated and the other is converted into a new compound
in which its amount may be determined by weighing. This will be a
reaction of substitution, such as is often taken advantage of for
analysis. The first analysis of water was thus conducted in 1784 by
Lavoisier and Meusnier. The apparatus they arranged consisted of a
glass retort containing water previously purified, and of which the
weight had been determined. The neck of the retort was inserted into
a porcelain tube, placed inside an oven, and heated to a red heat by
charcoal. Iron filings, which decompose water at a red heat, were
placed inside this tube. The end of the tube was connected with a
worm, for condensing any water which might pass through the tube
undecomposed. This condensed water was collected in a separate
flask. The gas formed by the decomposition was collected over water
in a bell jar. The aqueous vapour in passing over the red-hot iron was
decomposed, and a gas was formed from it whose weight could be
determined from its volume, its density being known. Besides the
water which passed through the tube unaltered, a certain quantity of
water disappeared in the experiment, and this quantity, in the experiments
of Lavoisier and Meusnier, was equal to the weight of gas which
was collected in the bell jar plus the increase in weight of the iron
filings. Hence the water was decomposed into a gas, which was
collected in the bell jar, and a substance, which combined with the
iron; consequently, it is composed of these two component parts. This
was the first analysis of water ever made; but here only one (and not
both) of the gaseous component parts of water was collected separately.
Both the component parts of water can, however, be simultaneously
obtained in a free state. For this purpose the decomposition is brought
about by a galvanic current or by heat, as we shall learn directly.<a name="FNanchor_1_122" id="FNanchor_1_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_122" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Water is a bad conductor of electricity&mdash;that is, pure water does
not transmit a feeble current; but if any salt or acid be dissolved in
it, then its conductivity increases, and <i>on the passage of a current</i>
through acidified water <i>it is decomposed</i> into its component parts.
Some sulphuric acid is generally added to the water. By immersing
platinum plates (electrodes) in this water (platinum is chosen because
it is not acted on by acids, whilst many other metals are chemically
acted on by acids), and connecting them with a galvanic battery, it
will be observed that bubbles of gas appear on these plates. The gas
which separates is called <i>detonating gas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2_123" id="FNanchor_2_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_123" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> because, on ignition, it very
easily explodes.<a name="FNanchor_3_124" id="FNanchor_3_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_124" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> What takes place is as follows:&mdash;First, the water,
by the action of the current, is decomposed into two gases. The
mixture of these gases forms detonating gas. When detonating gas is
brought into contact with an incandescent substance&mdash;for instance, a
lighted taper&mdash;the gases re-combine, forming water, the combination
being accompanied by a great evolution of heat, and therefore the
vapour of the water formed expands considerably, which it does very
rapidly, and as a consequence, an explosion takes place&mdash;that is, sound
and increase of pressure, and atmospheric disturbance, as in the explosion
of gunpowder.</p>

<p class="caption" style="width: 250px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 18.&mdash;Decomposition of water
by the galvanic current, for
determining the relation between
the volumes of hydrogen
and oxygen.</p></div>

<p>In order to discover what gases are obtained by the decomposition
of water, the gases which separate at each electrode must be collected
separately. For this purpose a V-shaped tube is taken; one of its
ends is open and the other fused up. A platinum wire, terminating
inside the tube in a plate, is fused into the closed end; the closed end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
is entirely filled with water<a name="FNanchor_4_125" id="FNanchor_4_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_125" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> acidified with sulphuric acid, and another
platinum wire, terminating in a plate, is immersed in the open end.
If a current from a galvanic battery be now passed through the wires
an evolution of gases will be observed, and the gas which is obtained
in the open branch passes into the air, while that in the closed branch
accumulates above the water. As this gas accumulates it displaces the
water, which continues to descend in the closed and ascend into the
open branch of the tubes. When the water, in this way, reaches the
top of the open end, the passage of the current is stopped, and the gas
which was evolved from one of the electrodes only is obtained in the
apparatus. By this means it is easy to prove that a particular gas
appears at each electrode. If the closed end be connected with the
negative pole&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> with that joined to the zinc&mdash;then the gas collected
in the apparatus is capable of burning. This may be demonstrated by
the following experiment:&mdash;The bent tube is taken off the stand, and
its open end stopped up with the thumb and inclined in such a manner
that the gas passes from the closed to the open end. It will then be
found, on applying a lighted lamp or taper, that the gas burns. This
combustible gas is <i>hydrogen</i>. If the same experiment be carried on
with a current passing in the opposite direction&mdash;that is, if the closed
end be joined up with the positive pole (<i>i.e.</i> with the carbon, copper,
or platinum), then the gas which is evolved from it does not itself burn,
but it supports combustion very vigorously, so that a smouldering taper
in it immediately bursts into flame. This gas, which is collected at the
anode or positive pole, is <i>oxygen</i>, which is obtained, as we saw before
(in the Introduction), from mercury oxide and is contained in air.</p>

<p>Thus in the decomposition of water oxygen appears at the positive
pole and hydrogen at the negative pole,<a name="FNanchor_4_BIS_126" id="FNanchor_4_BIS_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_BIS_126" class="fnanchor">[4 bis]</a> so that detonating gas will be
a mixture of both. Hydrogen burns in air from the fact that in doing
so it re-forms water, with the oxygen of the air. Detonating gas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
explodes from the fact that the hydrogen burns in the oxygen mixed
with it. It is very easy to measure the relative quantities of one and
the other gas which are evolved in the decomposition of water. For
this purpose a funnel is taken, whose orifice
is closed by a cork through which two platinum
wires pass. These wires are connected
with a battery. Acidified water is poured
into the funnel, and a glass cylinder full of
water is placed over the end of each wire
(fig. <a href="#fig_18">18</a>). On passing a current, hydrogen and
oxygen collect in these cylinders, and it will
easily be seen that two volumes of hydrogen are
evolved for every one volume of oxygen. This
signifies that, in decomposing, water gives two
volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen.</p>

<p>Water is also decomposed into its component
parts by <i>the action of heat</i>. At the
melting point of silver (960°), and in its
presence, water is decomposed and the oxygen
absorbed by the molten silver, which dissolves
it so long as it is liquid. But directly the silver solidifies the
oxygen is expelled from it. However, this experiment is not entirely
convincing; it might be thought that in this case the decomposition of
the water did not proceed from the action of heat, but from the action
of the silver on water&mdash;that silver decomposes water, taking up the
oxygen. If steam be passed through a red-hot tube, whose internal
temperature attains 1,000°, then a portion<a name="FNanchor_5_127" id="FNanchor_5_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_127" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of the water decomposes
into its component parts, forming detonating gas. But on passing
into the cooler portions of the apparatus this detonating gas again reunites
and forms water. The hydrogen and oxygen obtained combine
together at a lower temperature.<a name="FNanchor_6_128" id="FNanchor_6_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_128" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Apparently the problem&mdash;to show
the decomposability of water at high temperatures&mdash;is unattainable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
It was considered as such before Henri Sainte-Claire Deville (in the
fifties) introduced the conception of dissociation into chemistry, as of
a change of chemical state resembling evaporation, if decomposition be
likened to boiling, and before he had demonstrated the decomposability
of water by the action of heat in an experiment which will presently be
described. In order to demonstrate clearly the <i>dissociation</i> of water,
or its decomposability by heat, at a temperature approaching that at
which it is formed, it was necessary to separate the hydrogen from the
oxygen at a high temperature, without allowing the mixture to cool.
Deville took advantage of the difference between the densities of
hydrogen and oxygen.</p>

<p>A wide porcelain tube <span class="smcap">P</span> (fig. <a href="#fig_19">19</a>) is placed in a furnace, which can
be raised to a high temperature (it should be heated with small pieces
of good coke). In this tube there is inserted a second tube <span class="smcap">T</span>, of
smaller diameter, made of unglazed earthenware and therefore porous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
The ends of the tube are luted to the wide tube, and two tubes, <span class="smcap">C</span> and
<span class="smcap">C'</span>, are inserted into the ends, as shown in the drawing. With this
arrangement it is possible for a gas to pass into the annular space between
the walls of the two tubes, from whence it can be collected.
Steam from a retort or flask is passed through the tube D, into the
inner porous tube <span class="smcap">T</span>. This steam on entering the red-hot space is decomposed
into hydrogen and oxygen. The densities of these gases are
very different, hydrogen being sixteen times lighter than oxygen.
Light gases, as we saw above, penetrate through porous surfaces very
much more rapidly than denser gases, and therefore the hydrogen
passes through the pores of the tube into the annular space very much
more rapidly than the oxygen. The hydrogen which separates out into
the annular space can only be collected when this space does not
contain any oxygen. If any air remains in this space, then the hydrogen
which separates out will combine with its oxygen and form water.
For this reason a gas incapable of supporting combustion&mdash;for instance,
nitrogen or carbonic anhydride&mdash;is previously passed into the annular
space. Thus the carbonic anhydride is passed through the tube <span class="smcap">C</span>, and
the hydrogen, separated from the steam, is collected through the tube <span class="smcap">C'</span>,
and will be partly mixed with carbonic anhydride. A certain portion
of the carbonic anhydride will penetrate through the pores of the unglazed
tube into the interior of the tube <span class="smcap">T</span>. The oxygen will remain
in this tube, and the volume of the remaining oxygen will be half that
of the volume of hydrogen which separates out from the annular
space.<a name="FNanchor_6_BIS_129" id="FNanchor_6_BIS_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_BIS_129" class="fnanchor">[6 bis]</a></p>

<p>The decomposition of water is effected much more easily by a
method of substitution, taking advantage of the affinity of substances
for the oxygen or the hydrogen of water. If a substance be added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
water, which takes up the oxygen and replaces the hydrogen&mdash;then we
shall obtain the latter gas from the water. Thus with sodium, water
gives hydrogen, and with chlorine, which takes up the hydrogen,
oxygen is obtained.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is evolved from water by many metals, which are capable
of forming oxides in air&mdash;that is, which are capable of burning or combining
with oxygen. The capacity of metals for combining with
oxygen, and therefore for decomposing water, or for the evolution of
hydrogen, is very dissimilar.<a name="FNanchor_7_130" id="FNanchor_7_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_130" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Among metals, potassium and sodium
exhibit considerable energy in this respect. The first occurs in potash,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
the second in soda. They are both lighter than water, soft, and easily
change in air. By bringing one or the other of them in contact with
water at the ordinary temperature,<a name="FNanchor_8_131" id="FNanchor_8_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_131" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> a quantity of hydrogen, corresponding
with the amount of the metal taken, may be directly obtained.
One gram of hydrogen, occupying a volume of 11·16 litres at 0° and
760 mm., is evolved from every 39 grams of potassium, or 23 grams of
sodium. The phenomenon may be observed in the following way: a
solution of sodium in mercury&mdash;or &lsquo;sodium amalgam,&rsquo; as it is generally
called&mdash;is poured into a vessel containing water, and owing to its
weight sinks to the bottom; the sodium held in the mercury then acts
on the water like pure sodium, liberating hydrogen. The mercury does
not act here, and the same amount of it as was taken for dissolving the
sodium is obtained in the residue. The hydrogen is evolved gradually
in the form of bubbles, which pass through the liquid.</p>

<p>Beyond the hydrogen evolved and a solid substance, which remains
in solution (it may be obtained by evaporating the resultant solution)
no other products are here obtained. Consequently, from the two substances
(water and sodium) taken, the same number of new substances
(hydrogen and the substance dissolved in water) have been obtained,
from which we may conclude that the reaction which here takes place
is a reaction of double decomposition or of substitution. The resultant
solid is nothing else but the so-called caustic soda (sodium hydroxide),
which is made up of sodium, oxygen, and half of the hydrogen
contained in the water. Therefore, the substitution took place between
the hydrogen and the sodium, namely half of the hydrogen in the water
was replaced by the sodium, and was evolved in a free state. Hence
the reaction which takes place here may be expressed by the equation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
H<sub>2</sub>O + Na = NaHO + H; the meaning of this is clear from what has
already been said.<a name="FNanchor_9_132" id="FNanchor_9_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_132" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Sodium and potassium act on water at the ordinary temperature.
Other heavier metals only act on it with a rise of temperature, and
then not so rapidly or vigorously. Thus magnesium and calcium only
liberate hydrogen from water at its boiling point, and zinc and iron
only a red heat, whilst a whole series of heavy metals, such as copper,
lead, mercury, silver, gold, and platinum, do not in the least decompose
water at any temperature, and do not replace its hydrogen.</p>

<p>From this it is clear that hydrogen may be obtained by the decomposition
of steam by the action of iron (or zinc) with a rise of temperature.
The experiment is conducted in the following manner: pieces
of iron (filings, nails, &amp;c.), are placed in a porcelain tube, which is then
subjected to a strong heat and steam passed through it. The steam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
coming into contact with the iron, gives up its oxygen to it, and thus
the hydrogen is set free and passes out at the other end of the tube
together with undecomposed steam. This method, which is historically
very significant,<a name="FNanchor_10_133" id="FNanchor_10_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_133" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is practically inconvenient, as it requires a rather
high temperature. Further, this reaction, as a reversible one (a red-hot
mass of iron decomposes a current of steam, forming oxide and
hydrogen; and a mass of oxide of iron, heated to redness in a stream
of hydrogen, forms iron and steam), does not proceed in virtue of the
comparatively small difference between the affinity of oxygen for iron
(or zinc) and for hydrogen, but only because the hydrogen escapes, as
it is formed, in virtue of its elasticity.<a name="FNanchor_11_134" id="FNanchor_11_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_134" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> If the oxygen compounds&mdash;that
is, the oxides&mdash;which are obtained from the iron or zinc, be able
to pass into solution, then the affinity acting in solution is added, and the
reaction may become non-reversible, and proceed with comparatively
much greater facility.<a name="FNanchor_12_135" id="FNanchor_12_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_135" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> As the oxides of iron and zinc, by themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
insoluble in water, are capable of combining with (have an affinity for)
acid oxides (as we shall afterwards fully consider), and form saline and
soluble substances, with acids, or hydrates having acid properties, hence
by the action of such hydrates, or of their aqueous solutions,<a name="FNanchor_13_136" id="FNanchor_13_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_136" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> iron
and zinc are able to liberate hydrogen with great ease at the ordinary
temperature&mdash;that is, they act on solutions of acids just as sodium acts
on water.<a name="FNanchor_14_137" id="FNanchor_14_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_137" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, is usually chosen for this purpose;
the hydrogen is displaced from it by many metals with much greater
facility than directly from water, and such a displacement is accompanied
by the evolution of a large amount of heat.<a name="FNanchor_15_138" id="FNanchor_15_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_138" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> When the hydrogen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
sulphuric acid is replaced by a metal, a substance is obtained which is
called a salt of sulphuric acid or a sulphate. Thus, by the action of zinc
on sulphuric acid, hydrogen and zinc sulphate ZnSO<sub>4</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_15_BIS_139" id="FNanchor_15_BIS_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_BIS_139" class="fnanchor">[15 bis]</a> are obtained.
The latter is a solid substance, soluble in water. In order that the
action of the metal on the acid should go on regularly, and to the end,
it is necessary that the acid should be diluted with water, which dissolves
the salt as it is formed; otherwise the salt covers the metal,
and hinders the acid from attacking it. Usually the acid is diluted
with from three to five times its volume of water, and the metal is
covered with this solution. In order that the metal should act
rapidly on the acid, it should present a large surface, so that a maximum
amount of the reacting substances may come into contact in a
given time. For this purpose the zinc is used as strips of sheet zinc,
or in the granulated form (that is, zinc which has been poured from a
certain height, in a molten state, into water). The iron should be in
the form of wire, nails, filings, or cuttings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The usual method of obtaining hydrogen is as follows:&mdash;A certain
quantity of granulated zinc is put into a double-necked, or Woulfe's,
bottle. Into one neck a funnel is placed, reaching to the bottom of
the bottle, so that the liquid poured in may prevent the hydrogen from
escaping through it. The gas escapes through a special gas conducting
tube, which is firmly fixed, by a cork, into the other neck, and ends in
a water bath (fig. <a href="#fig_20">20</a>), under the orifice of a glass cylinder full of
water.<a name="FNanchor_16_140" id="FNanchor_16_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_140" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> If sulphuric acid be now poured into the Woulfe's bottle it
will soon be seen that bubbles of a gas are evolved, which is hydrogen.
The first part of the gas evolved should not be collected, as it is
mixed with the air originally in the apparatus. This precaution
should be taken in the preparation of all gases. Time must be allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
for the gas evolved to displace all the air from the apparatus, otherwise
in testing the combustibility of the hydrogen an explosion may occur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
from the formation of detonating gas (the mixture of the oxygen of the
air with the hydrogen).<a name="FNanchor_17_141" id="FNanchor_17_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_141" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>Hydrogen, besides being contained in water, is also contained in
many other substances,<a name="FNanchor_18_142" id="FNanchor_18_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_142" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and may be obtained from them. As examples
of this, it may be mentioned (1) that a mixture of formate of sodium,
CHNaO<sub>2</sub>, and caustic soda, NaHO, when heated to redness, forms
sodium carbonate, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>;<a name="FNanchor_19_143" id="FNanchor_19_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_143" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> (2) that a number of
organic substances are decomposed at a red heat, forming hydrogen,
among other gases, and thus it is that hydrogen is contained in ordinary
coal gas.</p>

<p>Charcoal itself liberates hydrogen from steam at a high temperature;<a name="FNanchor_20_144" id="FNanchor_20_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_144" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
but the reaction which here takes place is distinguished by a
certain complexity, and will therefore be considered later.</p>

<p><i>The properties of hydrogen.</i>&mdash;Hydrogen presents us with an example
of a gas which at first sight does not differ from air. It is not surprising,
therefore, that Paracelsus, having discovered that an aëriform
substance is obtained by the action of metals on sulphuric acid, did not
determine exactly its difference from air. In fact, hydrogen, like air, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
colourless, and has no smell;<a name="FNanchor_21_145" id="FNanchor_21_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_145" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but a more intimate acquaintance with
its properties proves it to be entirely different from air. The first sign
which distinguishes hydrogen from air is its combustibility. This
property is so easily observed that it is the one to which recourse is
usually had in order to recognise hydrogen, if it is evolved in a reaction,
although there are many other combustible gases. But before
speaking of the combustibility and other chemical properties of hydrogen,
we will first describe the physical properties of this gas, as we
did in the case of water. It is easy to show that it is one of the
lightest gases.<a name="FNanchor_22_146" id="FNanchor_22_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_146" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> If passed into the bottom of a flask full of air,
hydrogen will not remain in it, but, owing to its lightness, rapidly
escapes and mixes with the atmosphere. If, however, a cylinder whose
orifice is turned downwards be filled with hydrogen, it will not escape,
or, more correctly, it will only slowly mix with the atmosphere. This
may be demonstrated by the fact that a lighted taper sets fire to the
hydrogen at the orifice of the cylinder, and is itself extinguished inside
the cylinder. Hence, hydrogen, being itself combustible, does not
support combustion. The great lightness of hydrogen is taken advantage
of for balloons. Ordinary coal gas, which is often also used for
the same purpose, is only about twice as light as air, whilst hydrogen is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
14&frac12; times lighter than air. A very simple experiment with soap
bubbles very well illustrates the application of hydrogen for filling
balloons. Charles, of Paris, showed the lightness of hydrogen in this
way, and constructed a balloon filled with hydrogen almost simultaneously
with Montgolfier. One litre of pure and dry hydrogen<a name="FNanchor_23_147" id="FNanchor_23_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_147" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
0° and 760 mm. pressure weighs 0·08986 gram; that is, hydrogen is
almost 14&frac12; (more exactly, 14·39) times lighter than air. It is the
lightest of all gases. The small density of hydrogen determines many
remarkable properties which it shows; thus, hydrogen passes exceedingly
rapidly through fine orifices, its molecules (Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.) being
endued with the greatest velocity.<a name="FNanchor_24_148" id="FNanchor_24_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_148" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> At pressures somewhat higher
than the atmospheric pressure, all other gases exhibit a greater
compressibility and co-efficient of expansion than they should according
to the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac; whilst hydrogen, on
the contrary, is compressed to a less degree than it should be from
the law of Mariotte,<a name="FNanchor_25_149" id="FNanchor_25_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_149" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and with a rise of pressure it expands slightly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
less than at the atmospheric pressure.<a name="FNanchor_26_150" id="FNanchor_26_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_150" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> However, hydrogen, like
air and many other gases which are permanent at the ordinary temperature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
does not pass into a liquid state under a very considerable
pressure,<a name="FNanchor_27_151" id="FNanchor_27_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_151" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> but is compressed into a lesser volume than would follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
from Mariotte's law.<a name="FNanchor_28_152" id="FNanchor_28_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_152" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> From this it may be concluded that the absolute
boiling point of hydrogen, and of gases resembling it,<a name="FNanchor_29_153" id="FNanchor_29_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_153" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> lies very
much below the ordinary temperature; that is, that the liquefaction of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a><br /><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a><br /><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
this <i>gas</i> is only possible at low temperatures, and under great pressures.<a name="FNanchor_30_154" id="FNanchor_30_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_154" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
This conclusion was verified (1877) by the experiments of Pictet and
Cailletet.<a name="FNanchor_31_155" id="FNanchor_31_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_155" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> They compressed gases at a very low temperature, and
then allowed them to expand, either by directly decreasing the pressure
or by allowing them to escape into the air, by which means the temperature
fell still lower, and then, just as steam when rapidly rarefied<a name="FNanchor_32_156" id="FNanchor_32_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_156" class="fnanchor">[32]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
deposits liquid water in the form of a fog, hydrogen in expanding
forms a fog, thus indicating its passage into a liquid state. But as yet
it has been impossible to preserve this liquid, even for a short time,
to determine its properties, notwithstanding the employment of a temperature
of -200° and a pressure of 200 atmospheres,<a name="FNanchor_33_157" id="FNanchor_33_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_157" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> although by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
these means the gases of the atmosphere may be kept in a liquid state
for a long time. This is due to the fact that the absolute boiling point
of hydrogen lies lower than that of all other known gases, which also
depends on the extreme lightness of hydrogen.<a name="FNanchor_34_158" id="FNanchor_34_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_158" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a><br /><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Although a substance which passes with great difficulty into a
liquid state by the action of physico-mechanical forces, hydrogen loses
its gaseous state (that is, its elasticity, or the physical energy of its
molecules, or their rapid progressive motion) with comparative ease
under the influence of chemical attraction,<a name="FNanchor_35_159" id="FNanchor_35_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_159" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> which is not only shown
from the fact that hydrogen and oxygen (two permanent gases) form
liquid water, but also from many phenomena of the absorption of
hydrogen.</p>

<p>Hydrogen is vigorously condensed by certain solids; for example,
by charcoal and by spongy platinum. If a piece of freshly ignited
charcoal be introduced into a cylinder full of hydrogen standing in a
mercury bath, then the charcoal absorbs as much as twice its volume
of hydrogen. Spongy platinum condenses still more hydrogen. But
<i>palladium</i>, a grey metal which occurs with platinum, absorbs more
hydrogen than any other metal. Graham showed that when heated to
a red heat and cooled in an atmosphere of hydrogen, palladium retains
as much as 600 volumes of hydrogen. When once absorbed it retains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the hydrogen at the ordinary temperature, and only parts with it when
heated to a red heat.<a name="FNanchor_36_160" id="FNanchor_36_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_160" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> This capacity of certain dense metals for the
absorption of hydrogen explains the property of hydrogen of passing
through metallic tubes.<a name="FNanchor_37_161" id="FNanchor_37_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_161" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> It is termed <i>occlusion</i>, and presents a
similar phenomenon to solution; it is based on the capacity of metals
of forming unstable easily dissociating compounds<a name="FNanchor_38_162" id="FNanchor_38_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_162" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> with hydrogen,
similar to those which salts form with water.</p>

<p>At the ordinary temperature hydrogen very feebly and rarely enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
into chemical reaction. The capacity of gaseous hydrogen for reaction
becomes evident only under a change of circumstances&mdash;by compression,
heating, or the action of light, or at the moment of its evolution.
However, under these circumstances it <i>combines</i> directly with only a
very few of the elements. Hydrogen combines directly with oxygen,
sulphur, carbon, potassium, and certain other elements, but it does
not combine directly with either the majority of the metals or with
nitrogen, phosphorus, &amp;c. Compounds of hydrogen with certain
elements on which it does not act directly are, however, known; they
are not obtained by a direct method, but by reactions of decomposition,
or of double decomposition, of other hydrogen compounds. The
property of hydrogen of combining with oxygen at a red heat determines
its combustibility. We have already seen that hydrogen easily
takes fire, and that it then burns with a pale&mdash;that is, non-luminous&mdash;flame.<a name="FNanchor_39_163" id="FNanchor_39_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_163" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Hydrogen does not combine with the oxygen of the atmosphere
at the ordinary temperature; but this combination takes place
at a red heat,<a name="FNanchor_40_164" id="FNanchor_40_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_164" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and is accompanied by the evolution of much heat.
The product of this combination is water&mdash;that is, a compound of
oxygen and hydrogen. This is the <i>synthesis of water</i>, and we have
already noticed its analysis or decomposition into its component parts.
The synthesis of water may be very easily observed if a cold glass bell
jar be placed over a burning hydrogen flame, and, better still, if the
hydrogen flame be lighted in the tube of a condenser. The water will
condense in drops as it is formed on the walls of the condenser and
trickle down.<a name="FNanchor_41_165" id="FNanchor_41_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_165" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Light does not aid the combination of hydrogen and oxygen, so
that a mixture of these two gases does not change when exposed to the
action of light; but an electric spark acts just like a flame, and this is
taken advantage of for inflaming a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, or
detonating gas, inside a vessel, as will be explained in the following
chapters. As hydrogen (and oxygen also) is condensed by spongy
platinum, by which a rise of temperature ensues, and as platinum acts
by contact (Introduction), therefore hydrogen also combines with
oxygen, under the influence of platinum, as Döbereiner showed. If
spongy platinum be thrown into a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen,
an explosion takes place. If a mixture of the gases be passed over
spongy platinum, combination also ensues, and the platinum becomes
red-hot.<a name="FNanchor_42_166" id="FNanchor_42_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_166" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Although gaseous hydrogen does not act directly<a name="FNanchor_43_167" id="FNanchor_43_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_167" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> on many substances,
yet in a <i>nascent state</i> reaction often takes place. Thus, for
instance, water on which sodium amalgam is acting contains hydrogen
in a nascent state. The hydrogen is here evolved from a liquid,
and at the first moment of its formation must be in a condensed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
state.<a name="FNanchor_44_168" id="FNanchor_44_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_168" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> In this condition it is capable of reacting on substances on
which it does not act in a gaseous state.<a name="FNanchor_44_BIS_169" id="FNanchor_44_BIS_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_BIS_169" class="fnanchor">[44 bis]</a> Reactions of substitution
or displacement of metals by hydrogen at the moment of its formation
are particularly numerous.<a name="FNanchor_45_170" id="FNanchor_45_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_170" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Metals, as we shall afterwards see, are in many cases able to replace
each other; they also, and in some cases still more easily, replace and
are replaced by hydrogen. We have already seen examples of this in
the formation of hydrogen from water, sulphuric acid, &amp;c. In all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
cases the metals sodium, iron, or zinc displace the hydrogen which occurs
in these compounds. Hydrogen may be displaced from many of its
compounds by metals in exactly the same manner as it is displaced
from water; so, for example, hydrochloric acid, which is formed
directly by the combination of hydrogen with chlorine, gives hydrogen
by the action of a great many metals, just as sulphuric acid does.
Potassium and sodium also displace hydrogen from its compounds with
nitrogen; it is only from its compounds with carbon that hydrogen is
not displaced by metals. Hydrogen, in its turn, is able to replace
metals; this is accomplished most easily on heating, and with those
metals which do not themselves displace hydrogen. If hydrogen be
passed over the compounds of many metals with oxygen at a red heat,
it takes up the oxygen from the metals and displaces them just
as it is itself displaced by metals. If hydrogen be passed over the
compound of oxygen with copper at a red heat, then metallic copper
and water are obtained&mdash;CuO + H<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O + Cu. This kind of double
decomposition is called <i>reduction</i> with respect to the metal, which is
thus reduced to a metallic state from its combination with oxygen.
But it must be recollected that all metals do not displace hydrogen
from its compound with oxygen, and, conversely, hydrogen is not able
to displace all metals from their compounds with oxygen; thus it does
not displace potassium, calcium, or aluminium from its compounds
with oxygen. If the metals be arranged in the following series:
K, Na, Ca, Al ... Fe, Zn, Hg ... Cu, Pb, Ag, Au, then the
first are able to take up oxygen from water&mdash;that is, displace hydrogen&mdash;whilst
the last do not act thus, but are, on the contrary, reduced
by hydrogen&mdash;that is, have, as is said, a less affinity for oxygen than
hydrogen, whilst potassium, sodium, and calcium have more. This is
also expressed by the amount of heat evolved in the act of combination
with oxygen (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_7_130">7</a>), and is shown by the fact that potassium and
sodium and other similar metals evolve heat in decomposing water; but
copper, silver, and the like do not do this, because in combining with
oxygen they evolve less heat than hydrogen does, and therefore it happens
that when hydrogen reduces these metals heat is evolved. Thus,
for example, if 16 grams of oxygen combine with copper, 38,000 units
of heat are evolved; and when 16 grams of oxygen combine with
hydrogen, forming water, 69,000 units of heat are evolved; whilst 23
grams of sodium, in combining with 16 grams of oxygen, evolve 100,000
units of heat. This example clearly shows that chemical reactions
which proceed directly and unaided evolve heat. Sodium decomposes
water and hydrogen reduces copper, because they are <i>exothermal</i>
reactions, or those which evolve heat; copper does not decompose water,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
because such a reaction would be accompanied by an absorption (or
secretion) of heat, or belongs to the class of <i>endothermal</i> reactions in
which heat is absorbed; and such reactions do not generally proceed
directly, although they may take place with the aid of energy (electrical,
thermal, &amp;c.) borrowed from some foreign source.<a name="FNanchor_46_171" id="FNanchor_46_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_171" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The reduction of metals by hydrogen is taken advantage of for
<i>determining the exact composition of water by weight</i>. Copper oxide is
usually chosen for this purpose. It is heated to redness in hydrogen,
and the quantity of water thus formed is determined, when the quantity
of oxygen which occurs in it is found from the loss of weight of the
copper oxide. The copper oxide must be weighed immediately before
and after the experiment. The difference shows the weight of the
oxygen which entered into the composition of the water formed. In
this manner only solids have to be weighed, which is a very great gain
in the accuracy of the results obtained.<a name="FNanchor_47_172" id="FNanchor_47_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_172" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Dulong and Berzelius (1819)
were the first to determine the composition of water by this method,
and they found that water contains 88·91 of oxygen and 11·09 of
hydrogen in 100 parts by weight, or 8·008 parts of oxygen per one part
of hydrogen. Dumas (1842) improved on this method,<a name="FNanchor_48_173" id="FNanchor_48_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_173" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and found that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
water contains 12·575 parts of hydrogen per 100 parts of oxygen&mdash;that is,
7·990 parts of oxygen per 1 part of hydrogen&mdash;and therefore it is usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
accepted that <i>water contains eight parts by weight of oxygen to</i> one <i>part
by weight of hydrogen</i>. By whatever method water be obtained, it will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
always present the same composition. Whether it be taken from nature
and purified, or whether it be obtained from hydrogen by oxidation, or
whether it be separated from any of its compounds, or obtained by some
double decomposition&mdash;it will in every case contain one part by weight
of hydrogen and eight parts of oxygen. This is because water is a definite
chemical compound. Detonating gas, from which it may be formed, is
a simple mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, although a mixture of the
same composition as water. All the properties of both constituent
gases are preserved in detonating gas. Either one or the other gas
may be added to it without destroying its homogeneity. The fundamental
properties of oxygen and hydrogen are not found in water, and
neither of the gases can be directly combined with it. But they may be
evolved from it. In the formation of water there is an evolution of heat;
for the decomposition of water heat is required. All this is expressed
by the words, <i>Water is a definite chemical compound of hydrogen with
oxygen</i>. Taking the symbol of hydrogen, H, as expressing a unit quantity
by weight of this substance, and expressing 16 parts by weight
of oxygen by O, we can formulate all the above statements by the
chemical symbol of water, H<sub>2</sub>O. As only definite chemical compounds
are denoted by formulæ, having denoted the formula of a compound
substance we express by it the entire series of properties which
go to make up our conception of a definite compound, and at the
same time the quantitative composition of the substance by weight.
Further, as we shall afterwards see, formulæ express the volume of
the gases contained in a substance. Thus the formula of water shows
that it contains two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen.
Besides which, we shall learn that the formula expresses the density of
the vapour of a compound, and on this many properties of substances
depend, and, as we shall learn, determine the quantities of the bodies
entering into reactions. This vapour density we shall find also determines
the quantity of a substance entering into a reaction. Thus the
letters H<sub>2</sub>O tell the chemist the entire history of the substance. This
is an international language, which endows chemistry with a simplicity,
clearness, stability, and trustworthiness founded on the investigation
of the laws of nature.</p>

however, an entirely convincing proof that water was composed of hydrogen and oxygen
only. Davy, who investigated the decomposition of water by the galvanic current,
thought for a long time that, besides the gases, an acid and alkali were also obtained.
He was only convinced of the fact that water contains nothing but hydrogen and oxygen
by a long series of researches, which showed him that the appearance of an acid and
alkali in the decomposition of water proceeds from the presence of impurities (especially
from the presence of ammonium nitrate) in water. A final comprehension of the composition
of water is obtained from the accurate determination of the quantities of the
component parts which enter into its composition. It will be seen from this how many
data are necessary for proving the composition of water&mdash;that is, of the transformations
of which it is capable. What has been said of water refers to all other compounds; the
investigation of each one, the entire proof of its composition, can only be obtained by the
accumulation of a large mass of data referring to it.</p></div>

in the following manner. Some soapy water is prepared, so that it easily forms soap

tube is immersed. This tube is connected with any suitable apparatus, in which detonating
gas is evolved. Soap bubbles, full of this gas, are then formed. If the apparatus
in which the gas is produced be then removed (otherwise the explosion might travel into
the interior of the apparatus), and a lighted taper be brought to the soap bubbles, a very

in the production of an electric current from the dynamo and its transmission over considerable
distances, the electrolytic decomposition of many compound bodies has acquired
great importance, and the use of the electric current is making its way into many chemical
manufactures. Hence, Prof. D. A. Lachinoff's proposal to obtain hydrogen and oxygen
(both of which have many applications) by means of electrolysis (either of a 10 to 15 per cent.
solution of caustic soda or a 15 per cent. solution of sulphuric acid) may find a practical
application, at all events in the future. In general, owing to their simplicity, electrolytic
methods have a great future, but as yet, so long as the production of an electric current
remains so costly, their application is limited. And for this reason, although certain of
these methods are mentioned in this work, they are not specially considered, the more
so since a profitable and proper use of the electric current for chemical purposes requires
special electro-technical knowledge which beginners cannot he assumed to have, and
therefore, an exposition of the principles of electrotechnology as applied, to the production
of chemical transformations, although referred to in places, does not come within the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_127" id="Footnote_5_127"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_127"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> As water is formed by the combination of oxygen and hydrogen, with a considerable
evolution of heat, and as it can also be decomposed, this reaction is a reversible one
(<i>see</i> Introduction), and consequently at a high temperature the decomposition of water
cannot be complete&mdash;it is limited by the opposite reaction. Strictly speaking, it is
not known how much water is decomposed at a given temperature, although many efforts
(Bunsen, and others) have been made in various directions to solve this question. Not
knowing the coefficient of expansion, and the specific heat of gases at such high temperatures,
renders all calculations (from observations of the pressure on explosion)
doubtful.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_128" id="Footnote_6_128"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_128"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Grove, in 1847, observed that a platinum wire fused in the oxyhydrogen flame&mdash;that
is, having acquired the temperature of the formation of water&mdash;and having formed
a molten drop at its end which fell into water, evolved detonating gas&mdash;that is, decomposed
water. It therefore follows that water already decomposes at the temperature of
its formation. At that time, this formed a scientific paradox; this we shall unravel
only with the development of the conceptions of dissociation, introduced into science
by Henri Sainte-Claire Deville, in 1857. These conceptions form an important epoch
in science, and their development is one of the problems of modern chemistry. The
essence of the matter is that, at high temperatures, water exists but also decomposes,
just as a volatile liquid, at a certain temperature, exists both as a liquid and as a vapour.
Similarly as a volatile liquid saturates a space, attaining its maximum tension, so also
the products of dissociation have their maximum tension, and once that is attained
decomposition ceases, just as evaporation ceases. Under like conditions, if the vapour
be allowed to escape (and therefore its partial pressure be diminished), evaporation recommences,
so also if the products of decomposition be removed, decomposition again
continues. These simple conceptions of dissociation introduce infinitely varied consequences
into the mechanism of chemical reactions, and therefore we shall have occasion
to return to them very often. We may add that Grove also concluded that water was
decomposed at a white heat, from the fact that he obtained detonating gas by passing
steam through a tube with a wire heated strongly by an electric current, and also by
passing steam over molten oxide of lead, he obtained, on the one hand, litharge (= oxide
of lead and oxygen), and on the other, metallic lead formed by the action of hydrogen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_BIS_129" id="Footnote_6_BIS_129"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_BIS_129"><span class="label">[6 bis]</span></a> Part of the oxygen will also penetrate through the pores of the tube; but, as was
said before, a much smaller quantity than the hydrogen, and as the density of oxygen is
sixteen times greater than that of hydrogen, the volume of oxygen which passes through
the porous walls will be four times less than the volume of hydrogen (the quantities of
gases passing through porous walls are inversely proportional to the square roots of their
densities). The oxygen which separates out into the annular space will combine, at a
certain fall of temperature, with the hydrogen; but as each volume of oxygen only
requires two volumes of hydrogen, whilst at least four volumes of hydrogen will pass
through the porous walls for every volume of oxygen that passes, therefore, part of the
hydrogen will remain free, and can be collected from the annular space. A corresponding
quantity of oxygen remaining from the decomposition of the water can be collected from
the internal tube.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_130" id="Footnote_7_130"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_130"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> In order to demonstrate the difference of the affinity of oxygen for different
elements, it is enough to compare the amounts of heats which are evolved in their combination
with 16 parts by weight of oxygen; in the case of sodium (when Na<sub>2</sub>O is formed,
or 46 parts of Na combine with 16 parts of oxygen, according to Beketoff) 100,000 calories
(or units of heat), are evolved, for hydrogen (when water, H<sub>2</sub>O, is formed) 69,000 calories,
for iron (when the oxide FeO is formed) 69,000, and if the oxide Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is formed,
64,000 calories, for zinc (ZnO is formed) 86,000 calories, for lead (when PbO is formed)
51,000 calories, for copper (when CuO is formed) 38,000 calories, and for mercury (HgO
is formed) 31,000 calories.</p>

<p>These figures cannot correspond directly with the magnitude of the affinities, for the
physical and mechanical side of the matter is very different in the different cases.
Hydrogen is a gas, and, in combining with oxygen, gives a liquid; consequently it changes
its physical state, and, in doing so, evolves heat. But zinc and copper are solids, and,
in combining with oxygen, give solid oxides. The oxygen, previously a gas, now passes
into a solid or liquid state, and, therefore, also must have given up its store of heat in
forming oxides. As we shall afterwards see, the degree of contraction (and consequently
of mechanical work) was different in the different cases, and therefore the
figures expressing the heat of combination cannot directly depend on the affinities, on
the loss of internal energy previously in the elements. Nevertheless, the figures above
cited correspond, in a certain degree, with the order in which the elements stand in
respect to their affinity for oxygen, as may be seen from the fact that the mercury oxide,
which evolves the least heat (among the above examples), is the least stable is easily
decomposed, giving up its oxygen; whilst sodium, the formation of whose oxide is accompanied
by the greatest evolution of heat, is able to decompose all the other oxides, taking
up their oxygen. In order to generalise the connection between affinity and the evolution
and the absorption of heat, which is evident in its general features, and was firmly
established by the researches of Favre and Silbermann (about 1840), and then of Thomsen
(in Denmark) and Berthelot (in France), many investigators, especially the one last
mentioned, established the <i>law of maximum work</i>. This states that only those chemical
reactions take place of their own accord in which the greatest amount of chemical
(latent, potential) energy is transformed into heat. But, in the first place, we are not
able, judging from what has been said above, to distinguish that heat which corresponds
with purely chemical action from the sum total of the heat observed in a reaction (in the
calorimeter); in the second place, there are evidently endothermal reactions which
proceed under the same circumstances as exothermal (carbon burns in the vapour of
sulphur with absorption of heat, whilst in oxygen it evolves heat); and, in the third
place, there are reversible reactions, which when taking place in one direction evolve
heat, and when taking place in the opposite direction absorb it; and, therefore, the
principle of maximum work in its elementary form is not supported by science. But the
subject continues to be developed, and will probably lead to a general law, such as
thermal chemistry does not at present possess.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_131" id="Footnote_8_131"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_131"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> If a piece of metallic sodium be thrown into water, it floats on it (owing to its lightness),
keeps in a state of continual motion (owing to the evolution of hydrogen on
all sides), and immediately decomposes the water, evolving hydrogen, which can be
lighted. This experiment may, however, lead to an explosion should the sodium stick to
the walls of the vessel, and begin to act on the limited mass of water immediately adjacent
to it (probably in this case NaHO forms with Na, Na<sub>2</sub>O, which acts on the water, evolving
much heat and rapidly forming steam), and the experiment should therefore be carried
on with caution. The decomposition of water by sodium may he better demonstrated,
and with greater safety, in the following manner. Into a glass cylinder filled with mercury,
and immersed in a mercury bath, water is first introduced, which will, owing to its
lightness, rise to the top, and then a piece of sodium wrapped in paper is introduced with
forceps into the cylinder. The metal rises through the mercury to the surface of the
water, on which it remains, and evolves hydrogen, which collects in the cylinder, and
may be tested after the experiment has been completed. The safest method of making
this experiment is, however, as follows. The sodium (cleaned from the naphtha in which
it is kept) is either wrapped in fine copper gauze and held by forceps, or else held in
forceps at the end of which a small copper cage is attached, and is then held under
water. The evolution of hydrogen goes on quietly, and it may he collected in a bell
jar and then lighted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_132" id="Footnote_9_132"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_132"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> This reaction is vigorously exothermal, <i>i.e.</i> it is accompanied by the evolution of
heat. If a sufficient quantity of water be taken the whole of the sodium hydroxide, NaHO,
formed is dissolved, and about 42,500 units of heat are evolved per 23 grams of sodium
taken. As 40 grams of sodium hydroxide are produced, and they in dissolving, judging
from direct experiment, evolve about 10,000 calories; therefore, without an excess of
water, and without the formation of a solution, the reaction would evolve about 32,500
calories. We shall afterwards learn that hydrogen contains in its smallest isolable particles
H<sub>2</sub> and not H, and therefore it follows that the reaction should be written thus&mdash;2Na
+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub> + 2NaOH, and it then corresponds with an evolution of heat of +65,000
calories. And as N. N. Beketoff showed that Na<sub>2</sub>O, or anhydrous oxide of sodium, forms
the hydrate, or sodium hydroxide (caustic soda), 2NaHO, with water, evolving about 35,500
calories, therefore the reaction 2Na + H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>O corresponds to 29,500 calories.
This quantity of heat is less than that which is evolved in combining with water, in the
formation of caustic soda, and therefore it is not to be wondered at that the hydrate, NaHO,
is always formed and not the anhydrous substance Na<sub>2</sub>O. That such a conclusion, which
agrees with facts, is inevitable is also seen from the fact that, according to Beketoff, the
anhydrous sodium oxide, Na<sub>2</sub>O, acts directly on hydrogen, with separation of sodium,
Na<sub>2</sub>O + H = NaHO + Na. This reaction is accompanied by an evolution of heat equal to
about 3,000 calories, because Na<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O gives, as we saw, 35,500 calories and Na + H<sub>2</sub>O
evolves 32,500 calories. However, an opposite reaction also takes place&mdash;NaHO + Na =
Na<sub>2</sub>O + H (both with the aid of heat)&mdash;consequently, in this case heat is absorbed. In
this we see an example of calorimetric calculations and the limited application of the law
of maximum work for the general phenomena of reversible reactions, to which the case
just considered belongs. But it must be remarked that all reversible reactions evolve or
absorb but little heat, and the reason of the law of maximum work, not being universal
must first of all be looked for in the fact that we have no means of separating the heat
which corresponds with the purely chemical process from the sum total of the heat
observed, and as the structure of a number of substances is altered by heat and also by
contact, we can scarcely hope that the time approaches when such a distinction will be
possible. A heated substance, in point of fact, has no longer the original energy of its
atoms&mdash;that is, the act of heating not only alters the store of motion of the molecules
but also of the atoms forming the molecules, in other words, it makes the beginning of or
preparation for chemical change. From this it must be concluded that thermochemistry,
or the study of the heat accompanying chemical transformations, cannot he identified
with chemical mechanics. Thermo-chemical data form a part of it, but they alone cannot
give it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_133" id="Footnote_10_133"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_133"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The composition of water, as we saw above, was determined by passing steam over
red-hot iron; the same method has been used for making hydrogen for filling balloons.
An oxide having the composition Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is formed in the reaction, so that it is expressed
by the equation 3Fe + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 8H.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_134" id="Footnote_11_134"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_134"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The reaction between iron and water (note <a href="#Footnote_10_133">10</a>) is reversible. By heating the oxide
in a current of hydrogen, water and iron are obtained. From this it follows, from the
principle of chemical equilibria, that if iron and hydrogen be taken, and also oxygen, but
in such a quantity that it is insufficient for combination with both substances, then it will
divide itself between the two; part of it will combine with the iron and the other part
with the hydrogen, but a portion of both will remain in an uncombined state.</p>

<p>Therefore, if iron and water be placed in a closed space, decomposition of the water
will proceed on heating to the temperature at which the reaction 3Fe + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 8H
commences; but it ceases, does not go on to the end, because the conditions for a
reverse reaction are attained, and a state of equilibrium will ensue after the decomposition
of a certain quantity of water. Here again (<i>see</i> note <a href="#Footnote_9_132">9</a>) the reversibility is connected with
the small heat effect, and again both reactions (direct and reverse) proceed at a red
heat. But if, in the above-described reaction, the hydrogen escapes as it is evolved, then
its partial pressure does not increase with its formation, and therefore all the iron can he
oxidised by the water. In this we see the elements of that influence of mass to which we
shall have occasion to return later. With copper and lead there will be no decomposition,
either at the ordinary or at a high temperature, because the affinity of these metals for
oxygen is much less than that of hydrogen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_135" id="Footnote_12_135"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_135"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> In general, if reversible as well as non-reversible reactions can take place between
substances acting on each other, then, judging by our present knowledge, the non-reversible
reactions take place in the majority of cases, which obliges one to acknowledge
the action, in this case, of comparatively strong affinities. The reaction, Zn + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> =
H<sub>2</sub> + ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, which takes place in solutions at the ordinary temperature, is scarcely reversible
under these conditions, but at a certain high temperature it becomes reversible,
because at this temperature zinc sulphate and sulphuric acid split up, and the action must
take place between the water and zinc. From the preceding proposition results proceed
which are in some cases verified by experiment. If the action of zinc or iron on a solution
of sulphuric acid presents a non-reversible reaction, then we may by this means
obtain hydrogen in a very compressed state, and compressed hydrogen will not act on
solutions of sulphates of the above-named metals. This is verified in reality as far as was
possible in the experiments to keep up the compression or pressure of the hydrogen.
Those metals which do not evolve hydrogen with acids, on the contrary, should, at least
at an increase of pressure, be displaced by hydrogen. And in fact Brunner showed that
gaseous hydrogen displaces platinum and palladium from the aqueous solutions of
their chlorine compounds, but not gold, and Beketoff succeeded in showing that silver
and mercury, under a considerable pressure, are separated from the solutions of certain
of their compounds by means of hydrogen. Reaction already commences under a pressure
of six atmospheres, if a weak solution of silver sulphate be taken; with a stronger
solution a much greater pressure is required, however, for the separation of the silver.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_136" id="Footnote_13_136"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_136"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> For the same reason, many metals in acting on solutions of the alkalis displace
hydrogen. Aluminium acts particularly clearly in this respect, because its oxide gives a
soluble compound with alkalis. For the same reason tin, in acting on hydrochloric acid,
evolves hydrogen, and silicon does the same with hydrofluoric acid. It is evident that
in such cases the sum of all the affinities plays a part; for instance, taking the action of
zinc on sulphuric acid, we have the affinity of zinc for oxygen (forming zinc oxide, ZnO),
the affinity of its oxide for sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub> (forming zinc sulphate, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>), and
the affinity of the resultant salt, ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, for water. It is only the first-named affinity that
acts in the reaction between water and the metal, if no account is taken of those forces
(of a physico-mechanical character) which act between the molecules (for instance, the
cohesion between the molecules of the oxide) and those forces (of a chemical character)
which act between the atoms forming the molecule, for instance, between the atoms of
hydrogen giving the molecule H<sub>2</sub> containing two atoms. I consider it necessary to
remark, that the hypothesis of the affinity or endeavour of heterogeneous atoms to enter
into a common system and in harmonious motion (<i>i.e.</i> to form a compound molecule)
must inevitably be in accordance with the hypothesis of forces including homogeneous
atoms to form complex molecules (for instance, H<sub>2</sub>), and to build up the latter into solid
or liquid substances, in which the existence of an attraction between the homogeneous
particles must certainly be admitted. Therefore, those forces which bring about solution
must also be taken into consideration. These are all forces of one and the same series,
and in this may be seen the great difficulties surrounding the study of molecular mechanics
and its province&mdash;chemical mechanics.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_137" id="Footnote_14_137"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_137"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> It is acknowledged that zinc itself acts on water, even at the ordinary temperature,
but that the action is confined to small masses and only proceeds at the surface. In
reality, zinc, in the form of a very fine powder, or so-called &lsquo;zinc dust,&rsquo; is capable of
decomposing water with the formation of oxide (hydrated) and hydrogen. The oxide
formed acts on sulphuric acid, water then dissolves the salt produced, and the action
continues because one of the products of the action of water on zinc, zinc oxide, is removed
from the surface. One might naturally imagine that the reaction does not proceed
directly between the metal and water, but between the metal and the acid, but such a
simple representation, which we shall cite afterwards, hides the mechanism of the reaction,
and does not permit of its actual complexity being seen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_138" id="Footnote_15_138"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_138"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> According to Thomsen the reaction between zinc and a very weak solution of
sulphuric acid evolves about 38,000 calories (zinc sulphate being formed) per 65 parts
by weight of zinc; and 56 parts by weight of iron&mdash;which combine, like 65 parts by
weight of zinc, with 16 parts by weight of oxygen&mdash;evolve about 25,000 calories (forming
ferrous sulphate, FeSO<sub>4</sub>). Paracelsus observed the action of metals on acids in the
seventeenth century; but it was not until the eighteenth century that Lémery determined
that the gas which is evolved in this action is a particular one which differs from air
and is capable of burning. Even Boyle confused it with air. Cavendish determined the
chief properties of the gas discovered by Paracelsus. At first it was called &lsquo;inflammable
air&rsquo;; later, when it was recognised that in burning it gives water, it was called hydrogen,
from the Greek words for water and generator.</p></div>

It may also replace an aspirator or gasometer.</p></div>

<p>As laboratory experiments with gases require a certain preliminary knowledge, we
will describe certain <i>practical methods for the collection and preparation of gases</i>.
When in laboratory practice an intermittent supply of hydrogen (or other gas which is
evolved without the aid of heat) is required the apparatus represented in fig. <a href="#fig_21">21</a> is the
most convenient. It consists of two bottles, having orifices at the bottom, in which
corks with tubes are placed, and these tubes are connected by an india-rubber tube
(sometimes furnished with a spring clamp). Zinc is placed in one bottle, and dilute sulphuric
acid in the other. The neck of the former is closed by a cork, which is fitted with
a gas-conducting tube with a stopcock. If the two bottles are connected with each
other and the stopcock be opened, the acid will flow to the zinc and evolve hydrogen.
If the stopcock be closed, the hydrogen will force out the acid from the bottle containing
the zinc, and the action will cease. Or the vessel containing the acid may be placed at
a lower level than that containing the zinc, when all the liquid will flow into it, and in
order to start the action the acid vessel may be placed on a higher level than the other,
and the acid will flow to the zinc. It can also be employed for collecting gases (as an
aspirator or gasometer).</p>

<div class="figcenter_width">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 22.&mdash;Continuous aspirator. The tube <i>d</i> should be more than 32 feet long.</p></div>

<p>In laboratory practice, however, other forms of apparatus are generally employed for
exhausting, collecting, and holding gases. We will here cite the most usual forms. An
<i>aspirator</i> usually consists of a vessel furnished with a stopcock at the bottom. A stout
cork, through which a glass tube passes, is fixed into the neck of this vessel. If the
vessel be filled up with water to the cork and the bottom stopcock is opened, then the
water will run out and draw gas in. For this purpose the glass tube is connected with
the apparatus from which it is desired to pump out or exhaust the gas.</p>

<div class="figleft">

        <a name="fig_23" id="fig_23"></a>
<p class="caption" style="width: 250px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 23.&mdash;Gasholder.</p></div>

<p>The aspirator represented in fig. <a href="#fig_22">22</a> may be recommended for its continuous
action. It consists of a tube <i>d</i> which widens out at the top, the lower part being long
and narrow. In the expanded upper portion <i>c</i>, two tubes are sealed; one, <i>e</i>, for drawing
in the gas, whilst the other, <i>b</i>, is connected to the water supply <i>w</i>. The amount of water
supplied through the tube <i>b</i> must be less than the amount which can be carried off by
the tube <i>d</i>. Owing to this the water in the tube <i>d</i> will flow through it in cylinders
alternating with cylinders of gas, which will be thus carried away. The gas which is drawn
through may be collected from the end of the tube <i>d</i>, but this form of pump is usually
employed where the air or gas aspirated is not to be collected. If the tube <i>d</i> is of considerable
length, say 40 ft. or more, a very fair vacuum will be produced, the amount of
which is shown by the gauge <i>g</i>; it is often used for filtering under reduced pressure, as
shown in the figure. If water be replaced by mercury, and the length of the tube <i>d</i> be
greater than 760 mm., the aspirator may be employed as an air-pump, and all the air
may be exhausted from a limited space; for instance, by connecting <i>g</i> with a hollow
sphere.</p>

<p><i>Gasholders</i> are often used for collecting and holding gases. They are made of glass,
copper, or tin plate. The usual form is shown in fig. <a href="#fig_23">23</a>. The lower vessel <i>B</i> is made
hermetically tight&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, impervious to gases&mdash;and is filled with water. A funnel is
attached to this vessel (on several supports). The vessel <i>B</i> communicates with the
bottom of the funnel by a stopcock <i>b</i> and
a tube <i>a</i>, reaching to the bottom of the
vessel <i>B</i>. If water be poured into the
funnel and the stopcocks <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> opened,
the water will run through <i>a</i>, and the air
escape from the vessel <i>B</i> by <i>b</i>. A glass
tube <i>f</i> runs up the side of the vessel <i>B</i>, with
which it communicates at the top and bottom,
and shows the amount of water and
gas the gasholder contains. In order to fill
the gasholder with a gas, it is first filled
with water, the cocks <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>e</i> are closed,
the nut <i>d</i> unscrewed, and the end of the
tube conducting the gas from the apparatus
in which it is generated is passed into <i>d</i>.
As the gas fills the gasholder, the water
runs out at <i>d</i>. If the pressure of a gas be
not greater than the atmospheric pressure
and it be required to collect it in the gasholder,
then the stopcock <i>e</i> is put into
communication with the space containing
the gas. Then, having opened the orifice
<i>d</i>, the gasholder acts like an aspirator; the
gas will pass through <i>e</i>, and the water run
out at <i>d</i>. If the cocks be closed, the gas
collected in the gasholder may be easily
preserved and transported. If it be desired
to transfer this gas into another vessel,
then a gas-conducting tube is attached to <i>e</i>, the cock <i>a</i> opened, <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> closed, and the
gas will then pass out at <i>e</i>, owing to its pressure in the apparatus being greater than the
atmospheric pressure, due to the pressure of the water poured into the funnel. If it
be required to fill a cylinder or flask with the gas, it is filled with water and inverted in
the funnel, and the stopcocks <i>b</i> and <i>a</i> opened. Then water will run through <i>a</i>, and the
gas will escape from the gasholder into the cylinder through <i>b</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_141" id="Footnote_17_141"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_141"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> When it is required to prepare hydrogen in large quantities for filling balloons,
copper vessels or wooden casks lined with lead are employed; they are filled with scrap
iron, over which dilute sulphuric acid is poured. The hydrogen generated from a number
of casks is carried through lead pipes into special casks containing water (in order to cool
the gas) and lime (in order to remove acid fumes). To avoid loss of gas all the joints are
made hermetically tight with cement or tar. In order to fill his gigantic balloon (of
25,000 cubic metres capacity), Giffard, in 1878, constructed a complicated apparatus for
giving a continuous supply of hydrogen, in which a mixture of sulphuric acid and water
was continually run into vessels containing iron, and from which the solution of iron
sulphate formed was continually drawn off. When coal gas, extracted from coal, is
employed for filling balloons, it should be as light, or as rich in hydrogen, as possible.
For this reason, only the last portions of the gas coming from the retorts are collected,
and, besides this, it is then sometimes passed through red-hot vessels, in order to
decompose the hydrocarbons as much as possible; charcoal is deposited in the red-hot
vessels, and hydrogen remains as gas. Coal gas may be yet further enriched in hydrogen,
and consequently rendered lighter, by passing it over an ignited mixture of charcoal
and lime.</p>

<p>L. Mond (London) proposes to manufacture hydrogen on a large scale from water gas
(<i>see infra</i>, and Chapters <a href="#Page_338">VIII</a>. and <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>.), which contains a mixture of oxide of carbon (CO)
and hydrogen, and is produced by the action of steam upon incandescent coke (C + H<sub>2</sub>O
= CO + H<sub>2</sub>). He destroys the oxide of carbon by converting it into carbon and carbonic
anhydride (2CO = C + CO<sub>2</sub>), which is easily done by means of incandescent, finely-divided
metallic nickel; the carbon then remains with the nickel, from which it may be removed
by burning it in air, and the nickel can then be used over again (<i>see</i> Chapter IX., Note
<a href="#Footnote_24_BIS_537">24 bis</a>). The CO<sub>2</sub> formed is removed from the hydrogen by passing it through milk of
lime. This process should apparently give hydrogen on a large scale more economically
than any of the methods hitherto proposed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_142" id="Footnote_18_142"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_142"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Of the metals, only a very few combine with hydrogen (for example, sodium),
and give substances which are easily decomposed. Of the non-metals, the halogens
(fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine) most easily form hydrogen compounds; of these
the hydrogen compound of chlorine, and still more that of fluorine, is stable, whilst
those of bromine and iodine are easily decomposed, especially the latter. The other
non-metals&mdash;for instance, sulphur, carbon, and phosphorus&mdash;give hydrogen compounds
of different composition and properties, but they are all less stable than water. The
number of the carbon compounds of hydrogen is enormous, but there are very few
among them which are not decomposed, with separation of the carbon and hydrogen, at
a red heat.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_143" id="Footnote_19_143"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_143"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The reaction expressed by the equation CNaHO<sub>2</sub> + NaHO = CNa<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> may be
effected in a glass vessel, like the decomposition of copper carbonate or mercury oxide
(<i>see</i> Introduction); it is non-reversible, and takes place without the presence of water,
and therefore Pictet (<i>see</i> later) made use of it to obtain hydrogen under great pressure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_144" id="Footnote_20_144"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_144"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The reaction between charcoal and superheated steam is a double one&mdash;that is,
there may be formed either carbonic oxide, CO (according to the equation H<sub>2</sub>O + C
= H<sub>2</sub> + CO), or carbonic anhydride CO<sub>2</sub> (according to the equation 2H<sub>2</sub>O + C = 2H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>),
and the resulting mixture is called <i>water-gas</i>; we shall speak of it in Chapter <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_145" id="Footnote_21_145"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_145"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Hydrogen obtained by the action of zinc or iron on sulphuric acid generally smells
of hydrogen sulphide (like rotten eggs), which it contains in admixture. As a rule such
hydrogen is not so pure as that obtained by the action of an electric current or of sodium
on water. The impurity of the hydrogen depends on the impurities contained in the
zinc, or iron, and sulphuric acid, and on secondary reactions which take place simultaneously
with the main reaction. Impure hydrogen may be easily freed from the
impurities it contains: some of them&mdash;namely, those having acid properties&mdash;are absorbed
by caustic soda, and therefore may be removed by passing the hydrogen through a solution
of this substance; another series of impurities is absorbed by a solution of mercuric
chloride; and, lastly, a third series is absorbed by a solution of potassium permanganate.
If absolutely <i>pure hydrogen</i> be required, it is sometimes obtained by the decomposition
of water (previously boiled to expel all air, and mixed with pure sulphuric acid) by the
galvanic current. Only the gas evolved at the negative electrode is collected. Or else,
an apparatus like that which gives detonating gas is used, the positive electrode, however,
being immersed under mercury containing zinc in solution. The oxygen which is evolved
at this electrode then immediately, at the moment of its evolution, combines with the
zinc, and this compound dissolves in the sulphuric acid and forms zinc sulphate, which
remains in solution, and therefore the hydrogen generated will be quite free from oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_146" id="Footnote_22_146"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_146"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> An inverted beaker is attached to one arm of the beam of a tolerably sensitive
balance, and its weight counterpoised by weights in the pan attached to the other arm,
If the beaker be then filled with hydrogen it rises, owing to the air being replaced by
hydrogen. Thus, at the ordinary temperature of a room, a litre of air weighs about 1·2
gram, and on replacing the air by hydrogen a decrease in weight of about 1 gram per
litre is obtained. Moist hydrogen is heavier than dry&mdash;for aqueous vapour is nine times
heavier than hydrogen. In filling balloons it is usually calculated that (it being impossible
to have perfectly dry hydrogen or to obtain it quite free from air) the lifting force
due to the difference between the weights of equal volumes of hydrogen and air is equal
to 1 kilogram (= 1,000 grams) per cubic metre (= 1,000 litres).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23_147" id="Footnote_23_147"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_147"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The density of hydrogen in relation to the air has been repeatedly determined by
accurate experiments. The first determination, made by Lavoisier, was not very exact;
taking the density of air as unity, he obtained 0·0769 for that of hydrogen&mdash;that is,
hydrogen as thirteen times lighter than air. More accurate determinations are due to
Thomsen, who obtained the figure 0·0693; Berzelius and Dulong, who obtained 0·0688;
and Dumas and Boussingault, who obtained 0·06945. Regnault, and more recently Le
Duc (1892), took two spheres of considerable capacity, which contained equal volumes of
air (thus avoiding the necessity of any correction for weighing them in air). Both spheres
were attached to the scale pans of a balance. One was sealed up, and the other first
weighed empty and then full of hydrogen. Thus, knowing the weight of the hydrogen
filling the sphere, and the capacity of the sphere, it was easy to find the weight of a litre
of hydrogen; and, knowing the weight of a litre of air at the same temperature and
pressure, it was easy to calculate the density of hydrogen. Regnault, by these experiments,
found the average density of hydrogen to be 0·06926 in relation to air; Le Duc,
0·06948 (with a possible error of ±0·00001), and this latter figure must now be looked upon
as near to the truth.</p>

<p>In this work I shall always refer the densities of all gases to hydrogen, and not
to air; I will therefore give, for the sake of clearness, the weight of a litre of dry pure
hydrogen in grams at a temperature <i>t</i>° and under a pressure <i>H</i> (measured in millimetres
of mercury at 0°, in lat. 45°). The weight of a litre of hydrogen</p>

<p>For aëronauts it is very useful to know, besides this, the weight of the air at different
heights, and I therefore insert the adjoining table, constructed on the basis of Glaisher's
data, for the temperature and moisture of the atmospheric strata in clear weather. All
the figures are given in the metrical system&mdash;1,000 millimetres = 39·37 inches, 1,000 kilograms
= 2204·3375 lbs., 1,000 cubic metres = 35,316·6 cubic feet. The starting temperature
at the earth's surface is taken as = 15° C., its moisture 60 p.c., pressure 760 millimetres.
The pressures are taken as indicated by an <i>aneroid barometer</i>, assumed to be corrected
at the sea level and at lat. 45° C. If the height above the level of the sea equal <i>z</i> kilometres,
then the weight of 1 cubic metre of air may be approximately taken as 1·222 -
0·12<i>z</i> + 0·00377<i>z</i><sup>2</sup> kilogram.</p>

<p>Although the figures in this table are calculated with every possible care from average
data, yet they can only be taken approximately, for in every separate case the conditions,
both at the earth's surface and in the atmosphere, will differ from those here taken. In
calculating the height to which a balloon can ascend, it is evident that the density of gas
in relation to air must be known. This density for ordinary coal gas is from 0·6 to 0·35,
and for hydrogen with its ordinary contents of moisture and air from 0·1 to 0·15.</p>

<p>Hence, for instance, it may be calculated that a balloon of 1,000 cubic metres capacity
filled with pure hydrogen, and weighing (the envelope, tackle, people, and ballast) 727
kilograms, will only ascend to a height of about 4,250 metres.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_148" id="Footnote_24_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_148"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> If a cracked flask be filled with hydrogen and its neck immersed under water or
mercury, then the liquid will rise up into the flask, owing to the hydrogen passing
through the cracks about 3·8 times quicker than the air is able to pass through these
cracks into the flask. The same phenomenon may be better observed if, instead of a flask,
a tube be employed, whose end is closed by a porous substance, such as graphite, unglazed
earthenware, or a gypsum plate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_149" id="Footnote_25_149"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_149"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> According to Boyle and Mariotte's law, for a given gas at a constant temperature
the volume decreases by as many times as the pressure increases; that is, this law requires
that the product of the volume <i>v</i> and the pressure <i>p</i> for a given gas should be a constant
quantity: <i>pv</i> = <i>C</i>, a constant quantity which does not vary with a change of pressure.
This equation does very nearly and exactly express the observed relation between the
volume and pressure, but only within comparatively small variations of pressure, density,
and volume. If these variations be in any degree considerable, the quantity <i>pv</i> proves
to be dependent on the pressure, and it either increases or diminishes with an increase
of pressure. In the former case the compressibility is less than it should he according
to Mariotte's law, in the latter case it is greater. We will call the first case a positive
discrepancy (because then <i>d(pv)/d(p)</i> is greater than zero), and the second case a
negative discrepancy (because then <i>d(pv)/d(p)</i> is less than zero). Determinations made
by myself (in the seventies), M. L. Kirpicheff, and V. A. Hemilian showed that all known
gases at low pressures&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> when considerably rarefied&mdash;present positive discrepancies.
On the other hand, it appears from the researches of Cailletet, Natterer, and Amagat that
all gases under great pressures (when the volume obtained is 500&ndash;1,000 times less than
under the atmospheric pressure) also present positive discrepancies. Thus under a pressure
of 2,700 atmospheres air is compressed, not 2,700 times, but only 800, and hydrogen
1,000 times. Hence the positive kind of discrepancy is, so to say, normal to gases. And
this is easily intelligible. If a gas followed Mariotte's law, or if it were compressed to a
greater extent than is shown by this law, then under great pressures it would attain a
density greater than that of solid and liquid substances, which is in itself improbable and
even impossible by reason of the fact that solid and liquid substances are themselves but
little compressible. For instance, a cubic centimetre of oxygen at 0° and under the atmospheric
pressure weighs about 0·0014 gram, and at a pressure of 3,000 atmospheres
(this pressure is attained in guns) it would, if it followed Mariotte's law, weigh 4·2 grams&mdash;that
is, would be about four times heavier than water&mdash;and at a pressure of 10,000
atmospheres it would be heavier than mercury. Besides this, positive discrepancies are
probable because the molecules of a gas themselves must occupy a certain volume. Considering
that Mariotte's law, strictly speaking, applies only to the intermolecular space, we
can understand the necessity of positive discrepancies. If we designate the volume of the
molecules of a gas by <i>b</i> (like van der Waals, <i>see</i> Chap. I., Note <a href="#Footnote_34_81">34</a>), then it must be expected
that <i>p(v - b) = C</i>. Hence <i>pv = C + bp</i>, which expresses a positive discrepancy. Supposing
that for hydrogen <i>pv</i> = 1,000, at a pressure of one metre of mercury, according to the results
of Regnault's, Amagat's, and Natterer's experiments, we obtain <i>b</i> as approximately 0·7 to 0·9.</p>

<p>Thus the increase of <i>pv</i> with the increase of pressure must be considered as the
normal law of the compressibility of gases. Hydrogen presents such a positive compressibility
at all pressures, for it presents positive discrepancies from Mariotte's law, according
to Regnault, at all pressures above the atmospheric pressure. Hence hydrogen is,
so to say, a perfect gas. No other gas behaves so simply with a change of pressure. All
other gases at pressures from 1 to 30 atmospheres present negative discrepancies&mdash;that
is, they are then compressed to a greater degree than should follow from Mariotte's law,
as was shown by the determinations of Regnault, which were verified when repeated by
myself and Boguzsky. Thus, for example, on changing the pressure from 4 to 20 metres
of mercury&mdash;that is, on increasing the pressure five times&mdash;the volume only decreased
4·93 times when hydrogen was taken, and 5·06 when air was taken.</p>

<p>The positive discrepancies from the law at low pressures are of particular interest,
and, according to the above-mentioned determinations made by myself, Kirpicheff,
and Hemilian, and verified (by two methods) by K. D. Kraevitch and Prof. Ramsay
(London, 1894), they are proper to all gases (even to those which are easily compressed
into a liquid state, such as carbonic and sulphurous anhydrides). These discrepancies
approach the case of a very high rarefaction of gases, where a gas is near to a condition of
maximum dispersion of its molecules, and perhaps presents a passage towards the substance
termed &lsquo;luminiferous ether&rsquo; which fills up interplanetary and interstellar space.
If we suppose that gases are rarefiable to a definite limit only, having attained which
they (like solids) do not alter in volume with a decrease of pressure, then on the one
hand the passage of the atmosphere at its upper limits into a homogeneous ethereal
medium becomes comprehensible, and on the other hand it would be expected that gases
would, in a state of high rarefaction (<i>i.e.</i> when small masses of gases occupy large
volumes, or when furthest removed from a liquid state), present positive discrepancies
from Boyle and Mariotte's law. Our present acquaintance with this province of highly
rarefied gases is very limited (because direct measurements are exceedingly difficult to
make, and are hampered by possible errors of experiment, which may be considerable),
and its further development promises to elucidate much in respect to natural phenomena.
To the three states of matter (solid, liquid, and gaseous) it is evident a fourth must yet
be added, the ethereal or ultra-gaseous (as Crookes proposed), understanding by this,
matter in its highest possible state of rarefaction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_150" id="Footnote_26_150"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_150"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> The law of Gay-Lussac states that all gases in all conditions present one coefficient
of expansion 0·00367; that is, when heated from 0° to 100° they expand like air;
namely, a thousand volumes of a gas measured at 0° will occupy 1367 volumes at 100°.
Regnault, about 1850, showed that Gay-Lussac's law is not entirely correct, and that
different gases, and also one and the same gas at different pressures, have not quite the
same coefficients of expansion. Thus the expansion of air between 0° and 100° is 0·367
under the ordinary pressure of one atmosphere, and at three atmospheres it is 0·371, the
expansion of hydrogen is 0·366, and of carbonic anhydride 0·37. Regnault, however, did
not directly determine the change of volume between 0° and 100°, but measured the
variation of tension with the change of temperature; but since gases do not entirely
follow Mariotte's law, the change of volume cannot be directly judged by the variation
of tension. The investigations carried on by myself and Kayander, about 1870, showed
the variation of volume on heating from 0° to 100° under a constant pressure. These
investigations confirmed Regnault's conclusion that Gay-Lussac's law is not entirely
correct, and further showed (1) that the expansion per volume from 0° to 100° under a
pressure of one atmosphere, for air = 0·368, for hydrogen = 0·367, for carbonic anhydride
= 0·373, for hydrogen bromide = 0·386, &amp;c.; (2) that for gases which are more compressible
than should follow from Mariotte's law the expansion by heat increases with the
pressure&mdash;for example, for air at a pressure of three and a half atmospheres, it equals
0·371, for carbonic anhydride at one atmosphere it equals 0·373, at three atmospheres
0·389, and at eight atmospheres 0·413; (3) that for gases which are less compressible
than should follow from Mariotte's law, the expansion by heat decreases with an increase of
pressure&mdash;for example, for hydrogen at one atmosphere 0·367, at eight atmospheres 0·369,
for air at a quarter of an atmosphere 0·370, at one atmosphere 0·368; and hydrogen like
<i>air</i> (and all gases) is less compressed <i>at low pressures</i> than should follow from Mariotte's
law (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_25_149">25</a>). Hence, hydrogen, starting from zero to the highest pressures, exhibits
a gradually, although only slightly, varying coefficient of expansion, whilst for air and
other gases at the atmospheric and higher pressures, the coefficient of expansion
increases with the increase of pressure, so long as their compressibility is greater than
should follow from Mariotte's law. But when at considerable pressures, this kind of
discrepancy passes into the normal (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_25_149">25</a>), then the coefficient of expansion of all
gases decreases with an increase of pressure, as is seen from the researches of Amagat.
The difference between the two coefficients of expansion, for a constant pressure and for
a constant volume, is explained by these relations. Thus, for example, for air at a
pressure of one atmosphere the true coefficient of expansion (the volume varying at constant
pressure) = 0·00368 (according to Mendeléeff and Kayander) and the variation of
tension (at a constant volume, according to Regnault) = 0·00367.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_151" id="Footnote_27_151"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_151"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Permanent gases are those which cannot be liquefied by an increase of pressure
alone. With a rise of temperature, all gases and vapours become permanent gases. As
we shall afterwards learn, carbonic anhydride becomes a permanent gas at temperatures
above 31°, and at lower temperatures it has a maximum tension, and may be liquefied
by pressure alone.</p>

<p><i>The liquefaction</i> of gases, accomplished by Faraday (<i>see</i> Ammonia, Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>.) and
others, in the first half of this century, showed that a number of substances are capable,
like water, of taking all three physical states, and that there is no essential difference
between vapours and gases, the only distinction being that the boiling points (or the
temperature at which the tension = 760 mm.) of liquids lie above the ordinary temperature,
and those of liquefied gases below, and consequently a gas is a superheated vapour,
or vapour heated above the boiling point, or removed from saturation, rarefied, having
a lower tension than that maximum which is proper to a given temperature and substance.
We will here cite the <i>maximum tensions</i> of certain liquids and gases <i>at various
temperatures</i>, because they may be taken advantage of for obtaining constant temperatures
by changing the pressure at which boiling or the formation of saturated vapours
takes place. (I may remark that the dependence between the tension of the saturated
vapours of various substances and the temperature is very complex, and usually requires
three or four independent constants, which vary with the nature of the substance, and
are found from the dependence of the tension <i>p</i> on the temperature <i>t</i> given by experiment;
but in 1892 K. D. Kraevitch showed that this dependence is determined by the
properties of a substance, such as its density, specific heat, and latent heat of evaporation.)
The temperatures (according to the air thermometer) are placed on the left, and
the tension in millimetres of mercury (at 0°) on the right-hand side of the equations.

S, 395° = 300; 423° = 500; 443° = 700; 452° = 800; 459° = 900. These figures (Ramsay
and Young) show the possibility of obtaining constant temperatures in the vapours
of boiling liquids by altering the pressure. We may add the following boiling points
under a pressure of 760 mm. (according to the air thermometer by Collendar and
Griffiths, 1891): aniline, 184° = 13; naphthalene, 217° = 94; benzophenone, 305° = 82;
mercury, 356° = 76; triphenyl-methane, 356° = 44; sulphur, 444° = 53. And melting
points: tin, 231° = 68; bismuth, 269° = 22; lead, 327° = 69; and zinc, 417° = 57. These
data may be used for obtaining a constant temperature and for verifying thermometers.
The same object may be attained by the melting points of certain salts, determined
according to the air thermometer by V. Meyer and Riddle (1893): NaCl, 851°; NaBr,
727°; NaI, 650°; KCl, 760°; KBr, 715°; KI, 623°; K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 1045°; Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 1098°;

-20° = 23·1; 0° = 36·1; +20° = 55·3. Ethylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, -140° = 0·033; -130° = 0·1;
-103° = 1; -40° = 13; -1° = 42. Air, -191° = 1; -158° = 14; -140° = 39. Nitrogen,
N<sub>2</sub>, -203° = 0·085; -193° = 1; -160° = 14; -146° = 32. The methods of liquefying
gases (by pressure and cold) will be described under ammonia, nitrous oxide, sulphurous
anhydride, and in later footnotes. We will now turn our attention to the fact that the
evaporation of volatile liquids, under various, and especially under low, pressures, gives
an easy means for obtaining <i>low temperatures</i>. Thus liquefied carbonic anhydride, under
the ordinary pressure, reduces the temperature to -80°, and when it evaporates in a
rarefied atmosphere (under an air-pump) to 25 mm. (= 0·033 atmosphere) the temperature,
judging by the above-cited figures, falls to -115° (Dewar). Even the evaporation
of liquids of common occurrence, under low pressures easily attainable with an air-pump,
may produce low temperatures, which may be again taken advantage of for obtaining
still lower temperatures. Water boiling in a vacuum becomes cold, and under a pressure
of less than 4·5 mm. it freezes, because its tension at 0° is 4·5 mm. A sufficiently low
temperature may be obtained by forcing fine streams of air through common ether, or
liquid carbon bisulphide, CS<sub>2</sub>, or methyl chloride, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, and other similar volatile
liquids. In the adjoining table are given, for certain gases, (1) the number of atmospheres
necessary for their liquefaction at 15°, and (2) the boiling points of the resultant
liquids under a pressure of 760 mm.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_153" id="Footnote_29_153"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_153"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Cagniard de Latour, on heating ether in a closed tube to about 190°, observed that
at this temperature the liquid is transformed into vapour occupying the original volume&mdash;that
is, having the same density as the liquid. The further investigations made by Drion
and myself showed that every liquid has such an <i>absolute boiling point</i>, above which
it cannot exist as a liquid and is transformed into a dense gas. In order to grasp the true
signification of this absolute boiling temperature, it must be remembered that the liquid
state is characterised by a cohesion of its particles which does not exist in vapours and
gases. The cohesion of liquids is expressed in their capillary phenomena (the breaks
in a column of liquid, drop formation, and rise in capillary tubes, &amp;c.), and the product of
the density of a liquid into the height to which it rises in a capillary tube (of a definite
diameter) may serve as the measure of the magnitude of cohesion. Thus, in a tube of
1 mm. diameter, water at 15° rises (the height being corrected for the meniscus) 14·8 mm.,
and ether at <i>t°</i> to a height 5·35 - 0·028<i>t°</i> mm. The cohesion of a liquid is lessened by
heating, and therefore the capillary heights are also diminished. It has been shown
by experiment that this decrement is proportional to the temperature, and hence by the
aid of capillary observations we are able to form an idea that at a certain rise of
temperature the cohesion may become = 0. For ether, according to the above formula,
this would occur at 191°. If the cohesion disappear from a liquid it becomes a gas,
for cohesion is the only point of difference between these two states. A liquid in
evaporating and overcoming the force of cohesion absorbs heat. Therefore, the absolute
boiling point was defined by me (1861) as that temperature at which (<i>a</i>) a liquid cannot
exist as a liquid, but forms a gas which cannot pass into a liquid state under any pressure
whatever; (<i>b</i>) cohesion = 0; and (<i>c</i>) the latent heat of evaporation = 0.</p>

<p>This definition was but little known until Andrews (1869) explained the matter from
another aspect. Starting from gases, he discovered that carbonic anhydride cannot
be liquefied by any degree of compression at temperatures above 31°, whilst at lower
temperatures it can be liquefied. He called this temperature the <i>critical temperature</i>.
It is evident that it is the same as the absolute boiling point. We shall afterwards
designate it by <i>tc</i>. At low temperatures a gas which is subjected to a pressure greater
than its maximum tension (Note <a href="#Footnote_27_151">27</a>) is transformed into a liquid, which, in evaporating,
gives a saturated vapour possessing this maximum tension; whilst at temperatures above
tc the pressure to which the gas is subjected may increase indefinitely. However, under
these conditions the volume of the gas does not change indefinitely but approaches a
definite limit (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_28_152">28</a>)&mdash;that is, it resembles in this respect a liquid or a solid which
is altered but little in volume by pressure. The volume which a liquid or gas occupies
at <i>tc</i> is termed the <i>critical volume</i>, and corresponds with the <i>critical pressure</i>, which
we will designate by <i>pc</i> and express in atmospheres. It is evident from what has been
said that the discrepancies from Mariotte and Boyle's law, the absolute boiling point, the
density in liquid and compressed gaseous states, and the properties of liquids, must all
he intimately connected together. We will consider these relations in one of the following
notes. At present we will supplement the above observations by the values of <i>tc</i> and
<i>pc</i> for certain liquids and gases which have been investigated in this respect&mdash;</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 24.&mdash;General arrangement of the apparatus employed by Pictet for liquefying gases.</p></div>

<p>Pictet, in his researches, effected the direct liquefaction of many gases which up to
that time had not been liquefied. He employed the apparatus used for the manufacture
of ice on a large scale, employing the vaporisation of liquid sulphurous anhydride,
which may be liquefied by pressure alone. This anhydride is a gas which is transformed
into a liquid at the ordinary temperature under a pressure of several atmospheres (<i>see</i>
Note 27), and boils at -10° at the ordinary atmospheric pressure. This liquid, like all
others, boils at a lower temperature under a diminished pressure, and by continually
pumping out the gas which comes off by means of a powerful air-pump its boiling point
falls as low as -75°. Consequently, if on the one hand we force liquid sulphurous
anhydride into a vessel, and on the other hand pump out the gas from the same vessel
by powerful air-pumps, then the liquefied gas will boil in the vessel, and cause the temperature
in it to fall to -75°. If a second vessel is placed inside this vessel, then another
gas may be easily liquefied in it at the low temperature produced by the boiling liquid
sulphurous anhydride. Pictet in this manner easily liquefied carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>
(at -60° under a pressure of from four to six atmospheres). This gas is more refractory
to liquefaction than sulphurous anhydride, but for this reason it gives on evaporating a
still lower temperature than can be attained by the evaporation of sulphurous anhydride.
A temperature of -80° may be obtained by the evaporation of liquid carbonic anhydride at
a pressure of 760 mm., and in an atmosphere rarefied by a powerful pump the temperature
falls to -140°. By employing such low temperatures, it was possible, with the aid of
pressure, to liquefy the majority of the other gases. It is evident that special pumps
which are capable of rarefying gases are necessary to reduce the pressure in the
chambers in which the sulphurous and carbonic anhydride boil; and that, in order to
re-condense the resultant gases into liquids, special force pumps are required for pumping
the liquid anhydrides into the refrigerating chamber. Thus, in Pictet's apparatus
(fig. <a href="#fig_24">24</a>), the carbonic anhydride was liquefied by the aid of the pumps E F, which
compressed the gas (at a pressure of 4&ndash;6 atmospheres) and forced it into the tube K,
vigorously cooled by being surrounded by boiling liquid sulphurous anhydride, which
was condensed in the tube C by the pump B, and rarefied by the pump A. The
liquefied carbonic anhydride flowed down the tube K into the tube H, in which it was
subjected to a low pressure by the pump E, and thus gave a very low temperature of
about -140°. The pump E carried off the vapour of the carbonic anhydride, and conducted
it to the pump F, by which it was again liquefied. The carbonic anhydride thus
made an entire circuit&mdash;that is, it passed from a rarefied vapour of small tension and low
temperature into a compressed and cooled gas, which was transformed into a liquid, which
again vaporised and produced a low temperature.</p>

<p>Inside the wide inclined tube H, where the carbonic acid evaporated, was placed a
second and narrow tube M containing hydrogen, which was generated in the vessel L
from a mixture of sodium formate and caustic soda (CHO<sub>2</sub>Na + NaHO = Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>).
This mixture gives hydrogen on heating the vessel L. This vessel and the tube M
were made of thick copper, and could withstand great pressures. They were, moreover,
hermetically connected together and closed up. Thus the hydrogen which was
evolved had no outlet, accumulated in a limited space, and its pressure increased in
proportion to the amount of it evolved. This pressure was recorded on a metallic manometer
R attached to the end of the tube M. As the hydrogen in this tube was submitted
to a very low temperature and a powerful pressure, all the necessary conditions were
present for its liquefaction. When the pressure in the tube H became steady&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> when
the temperature had fallen to -140° and the manometer R indicated a pressure of 650
atmospheres in the tube M&mdash;then this pressure did not rise with a further evolution of
hydrogen in the vessel L. This served as an indication that the tension of the vapour of
the hydrogen had attained a maximum corresponding with -140°, and that consequently
all the excess of the gas was condensed to a liquid. Pictet convinced himself of this
by opening the cock N, when the liquid hydrogen rushed out from the orifice. But, on
leaving a space where the pressure was equal to 650 atmospheres, and coming into contact
with air under the ordinary pressure, the liquid or powerfully compressed hydrogen
expanded, began to boil, absorbed still more heat, and became still colder. In doing so
a portion of the liquid hydrogen, according to Pictet, passed into a solid state, and did
not fall in drops into a vessel placed under the outlet N, but as pieces of solid matter,
which struck against the sides of the vessel like shot and immediately vaporised.
Thus, although it was impossible to see and keep the liquefied hydrogen, still it was
clear that it passed not only into a liquid, but also into a solid state. Pictet in his experiments
obtained other gases which had not previously been liquefied, especially oxygen
and nitrogen, in a liquid and solid state. Pictet supposed that liquid and solid hydrogen
has the properties of a metal, like iron.</p></div>

<p class="caption" style="width: 250px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 25.&mdash;Cailletet's apparatus
for liquefying gases.</p></div>

<p>At the same time (1879) as Pictet was working on the liquefaction of gases in
Switzerland, Cailletet, in Paris, was occupied on the same subject, and his results,
although not so convincing as Pictet's, still showed that the majority of gases, previously
unliquefied, were capable of passing into a liquid state. Cailletet subjected gases to a
pressure of several hundred atmospheres in narrow thick-walled glass tubes (fig. <a href="#fig_25">25</a>); he
then cooled the compressed gas as far as possible by surrounding it with a freezing mixture;
a cock was then rapidly opened for the outlet of mercury from the tube containing
the gas, which consequently rapidly and vigorously expanded. This rapid expansion of
the gas would produce great cold, just as the rapid compression of a gas evolves heat and
causes a rise in temperature. This cold was produced at the expense of the gas itself,
for in rapidly expanding its particles were not able to absorb heat from the walls of the
tube, and in cooling a portion of the expanding gas was transformed into liquid. This
was seen from the formation of cloud-like drops like a fog which rendered the gas
opaque. Thus Cailletet proved the possibility of the liquefaction of gases, but he did not
isolate the liquids. The method of Cailletet allows the passage of gases into liquids
being observed with greater facility and simplicity than Pictet's method, which requires
a very complicated and expensive apparatus.</p>

<p>The methods of Pictet and Cailletet were afterwards improved by Olszewski,
Wroblewski, Dewar, and others. In order to obtain a still lower temperature they employed,
instead of carbonic acid gas, liquid ethylene or nitrogen
and oxygen, whose evaporation at low pressures produces
a much lower temperature (to -200°). They also
improved on the methods of determining such low temperatures,
but the methods were not essentially altered;
they obtained nitrogen and oxygen in a liquid, and nitrogen
even in a solid, state, but no one has yet succeeded in seeing
hydrogen in a liquid form.</p>

<p>The most illustrative and instructive results (because
they gave the possibility of maintaining a very low temperature
and the liquefied gas, even air, for a length of
time) were obtained in recent years by Prof. Dewar in the
Royal Institution of London, which is glorified by the names
of Davy, Faraday, and Tyndall. Dewar, with the aid of
powerful pumps, obtained many kilograms of oxygen and
air (the boiling point under the atmospheric pressure
= -190°) in a liquid state and kept them in this state for
a length of time by means of open glass vessels with
double walls, having a vacuum between them, which prevented
the rapid transference of heat, and so gave the possibility
of maintaining very low temperatures inside the
vessel for a long period of time. The liquefied oxygen or
air can be poured from one vessel into another and used
for any investigations. Thus in June 1894, Prof. Dewar
showed that at the low temperature produced by liquid
oxygen many substances become phosphorescent (become
self-luminous; for instance, oxygen on passing into a
vacuum) and fluoresce (emit light after being illuminated;
for instance, paraffin, glue, &amp;c.) much more powerfully than
at the ordinary temperature; also that solids then greatly alter in their mechanical properties,
&amp;c. I had the opportunity (1894) at Prof. Dewar's of seeing many such experiments
in which open vessels containing pounds of liquid oxygen were employed, and in
following the progress made in researches conducted at low temperatures, it is my firm
impression that the study of many phenomena at low temperatures should widen the
horizon of natural science as much as the investigation of phenomena made at the
highest temperatures attained in the voltaic arc.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_157" id="Footnote_33_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_157"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The investigations of S. Wroblewski in Cracow give reason to believe that Pictet
could not have obtained liquid hydrogen in the interior of his apparatus, and that if he
did obtain it, it could only have been at the moment of its outrush due to the fall in
temperature following its sudden expansion. Pictet calculated that he obtained a temperature
of -140°, but in reality it hardly fell below -120°, judging from the latest
data for the vaporisation of carbonic anhydride under low pressure. The difference
lies in the method of determining low temperatures. Judging from other properties of
hydrogen (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_34_158">34</a>), one would think that its absolute boiling point lies far below
-120°, and even -140° (according to the calculation of Sarrau, on the basis of its compressibility,
at -174°). But even at -200° (if the methods of determining such low
temperatures be correct) hydrogen does not give a liquid even under a pressure of several
hundred atmospheres. However, on expansion a fog is formed and a liquid state attained,
but the liquid does not separate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_158" id="Footnote_34_158"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_158"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> After the idea of the absolute temperature of ebullition (<i>tc</i>, Note <a href="#Footnote_29_153">29</a>) had been
worked out (about 1870), and its connection with the deviations from Mariotte's law
had become evident, and especially after the liquefaction of permanent gases, general
attention was turned to the development of the fundamental conceptions of the gaseous
and liquid states of matter. Some investigators directed their energies to the further
study of vapours (for instance, Ramsay and Young), gases (Amagat), and liquids
(Zaencheffsky, Nadeschdin, and others), especially to liquids near <i>tc</i> and <i>pc</i>; others
(Konovaloff and De Heen) endeavoured to discover the relation between liquids under
ordinary conditions (removed from <i>tc</i> and <i>pc</i>) and gases, whilst a third class of investigators
(van der Waals, Clausius, and others), starting from the generally-accepted
principles of the mechanical theory of heat and the kinetic theory of gases, and assuming
in gases the existence of those forces which certainly act in liquids, deduced the
connection between the properties of one and the other. It would be out of place in
an elementary handbook like the present to enunciate the whole mass of conclusions
arrived at by this method, but it is well to give an idea of the results of van der
Waals' considerations, for they explain the gradual uninterrupted passage from a liquid
into a gaseous state in the simplest manner, and, although the deduction cannot be
considered as complete and decisive (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_25_149">25</a>), nevertheless it penetrates so deeply
into the essence of the matter that its signification is not only reflected in a great number
of physical investigations, but also in the province of chemistry, where instances of the
passage of substances from a gaseous to a liquid state are so common, and where the
very processes of dissociation, decomposition, and combination must be identified with a
change of physical state of the participating substances, which has been elaborated by
Gibbs, Lavenig, and others.</p>

<p>For a <i>given quantity</i> (weight, mass) <i>of a definite substance</i>, its state is expressed
by three variables&mdash;volume <i>v</i>, pressure (elasticity, tension) <i>p</i>, and temperature <i>t</i>.
Although the compressibility&mdash;[<i>i.e.</i>, <i>d(v)</i>/<i>d(p)</i>]&mdash;of liquids is small, still it is clearly expressed,
and varies not only with the nature of liquids but also with their pressure and
temperature (at <i>tc</i> the compressibility of liquids is very considerable). Although gases,
according to Mariotte's law, with small variations of pressure, are uniformly compressed,
nevertheless the dependence of their volume <i>v</i> on <i>t</i> and <i>p</i> is very complex. This also
applies to the coefficient of expansion [= <i>d(v)</i>/<i>d(t)</i>, or <i>d(p)</i>/<i>d(t)</i>], which also varies with
<i>t</i> and <i>p</i>, both for gases (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_26_150">26</a>), and for liquids (at <i>tc</i> it is very considerable, and
often exceeds that of gases, 0·00367). Hence, the <i>equation of condition</i> must include
three variables, <i>v</i>, <i>p</i>, and <i>t</i>. For a so-called perfect (ideal) gas, or for inconsiderable
variations of density, the elementary expression <i>pv</i> = <i>Ra</i>(1 + <i>at</i>), or <i>pv</i> = <i>R</i>(273 + <i>t</i>) should
be accepted, where <i>R</i> is a constant varying with the mass and nature of a gas, as
expressing this dependence, because it includes in itself the laws of Gay-Lussac and
Mariotte, for at a constant pressure the volume varies proportionally to 1 + <i>at</i>, and when
<i>t</i> is constant the product of <i>tv</i> is constant. In its simplest form the equation may be
expressed thus:</p>

<p class="title"><i>pv</i> = <i>RT</i>;</p>

<p class="noindent">where <i>T</i> denotes what is termed the absolute temperature, or the ordinary temperature
+ 273&mdash;that is, <i>T</i> = <i>t</i> + 273.</p>

<p>Starting from the supposition of the existence of an attraction or internal pressure
(expressed by <i>a</i>) proportional to the square of the density (or inversely proportional to
the square of the volume), and of the existence of a real volume or diminished length
of path (expressed by <i>b</i>) for each gaseous molecule, van der Waals gives for gases the
following more complex equation of condition:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">(<i>p</i> +

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>v</i><sup>2</sup></span>
</span>

)(<i>v</i> - <i>b</i>) = 1 + 0·00367<i>t</i>;</p>

<p class="noindent">if at 0° under a pressure <i>p</i> = 1 (for example, under the atmospheric pressure), the volume
(for instance, a litre) of a gas or vapour he taken as 1, and therefore <i>v</i> and <i>b</i> be expressed
by the same units as <i>p</i> and <i>a</i>. The deviations from both the laws of Mariotte and Gay-Lussac
are expressed by the above equation. Thus, for hydrogen <i>a</i> must be taken as
infinitely small, and <i>b</i> = 0·0009, judging by the data for 1,000 and 2,500 metres pressure
(Note <a href="#Footnote_28_152">28</a>). For other permanent gases, for which (Note <a href="#Footnote_28_152">28</a>) I showed (about 1870) from
Regnault's and Natterer's data, a decrement of <i>pv</i>, followed by an increment, which was
confirmed (about 1880) by fresh determinations made by Amagat, this phenomena may
be expressed in definite magnitudes of <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (although van der Waals' formula is not
applicable in the case of very small pressures) with sufficient accuracy for contemporary
requirements. It is evident that van der Waals' formula can also express the difference
of the coefficients of expansion of gases with a change of pressure, and according to the
methods of determination (Note <a href="#Footnote_26_150">26</a>). Besides this, van der Waals' formula shows that
at temperatures above 273(

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">8<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">27<i>b</i></span>
</span>

-1) only one actual volume (gaseous) is possible,
whilst at lower temperatures, by varying the pressure, three different volumes&mdash;liquid,
gaseous, and partly liquid, partly saturated-vaporous&mdash;are possible. It is evident that
the above temperature is the absolute boiling point&mdash;that is (<i>tc</i>) = 273(

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">8<i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">27<i>b</i></span>
</span>

- 1). It is found under the condition that all three possible volumes (the three roots of van der
Waals' cubic equation) are then similar and equal (<i>vc</i> = 3<i>b</i>). The pressure in this case
(<i>pc</i>) =

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">27<i>b</i><sup>2</sup></span>
</span>.

These ratios between the constants <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> and the conditions of <i>critical
state</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> (<i>tc</i>) and (<i>pc</i>)&mdash;give the possibility of determining the one magnitude from the
other. Thus for ether (Note <a href="#Footnote_29_153">29</a>), (<i>tc</i>) = 193°, (<i>tp</i>) = 40, hence <i>a</i> = 0·0307, <i>b</i> = 0·00533, and
(<i>vc</i>) = 0·016. That mass of ether which at a pressure of one atmosphere at 0° occupies
one volume&mdash;for instance, a litre&mdash;occupies, according to the above-mentioned condition,
this critical volume. And as the density of the vapour of ether compared with hydrogen
= 37, and a litre of hydrogen at 0° and under the atmospheric pressure weighs 0·0896
gram, then a litre of ether vapour weighs 3·32 grams; therefore, in a critical state (at
193° and 40 atmospheres) 3·32 grams occupy 0·016 litre, or 16 c.c.; therefore 1 gram
occupies a volume of about 5 c.c., and the weight of 1 c.c. of ether will then be 0·21.
According to the investigations of Ramsay and Young (1887), the critical volume of ether
was approximately such at about the absolute boiling point, but the compressibility of
the liquid is so great that the slightest change of pressure or temperature has a considerable
effect on the volume. But the investigations of the above savants gave another
indirect demonstration of the truth of van der Waals' equation. They also found for
ether that the isochords, or the lines of equal volumes (if both <i>t</i> and <i>p</i> vary), are generally
straight lines. Thus the volume of 10 c.c. for 1 gram of ether corresponds with pressures
(expressed in metres of mercury) equal to 0·135<i>t</i> - 3·3 (for example, at 180° the pressure =
21 metres, and at 280° it = 34·5 metres). The rectilinear form of the isochord (when <i>v</i> = <i>a</i>
constant quantity) is a direct result of van der Waals' formula.</p>

<p>When, in 1883, I demonstrated that the specific gravity of liquids decreases in proportion
to the rise of temperature [S<sub><i>t</i></sub> = S<sub><i>0</i></sub> - K<i>t</i> or S<sub><i>t</i></sub> = S<sub><i>0</i></sub>(1 - K<i>t</i>)], or that the volumes
increase in inverse proportion to the binomial 1 - K<i>t</i>, that is, V<sub><i>t</i></sub> = V<sub><i>0</i></sub>(1-K<i>t</i>)<sup>-1</sup>, where K
is the modulus of expansion, which varies with the nature of the liquid, then, in general,
not only does a connection arise between gases and liquids with respect to a change of
volume, but also it would appear possible, by applying van der Waals' formula, to judge,
from the phenomena of the expansion of liquids, as to their transition into vapour, and
to connect together all the principal properties of liquids, which up to this time had
not been considered to be in direct dependence. Thus Thorpe and Rücker found that
2(<i>tc</i>) + 273 = 1/K, where K is the modulus of expansion in the above-mentioned formula.
For example, the expansion of ether is expressed with sufficient accuracy from 0° to 100°
by the equation S<sub><i>t</i></sub> = 0·736/(1 - 0·00154<i>t</i>), or V<sub><i>t</i></sub> = 1/(1 - 0·00154<i>t</i>), where 0·00154 is the
modulus of expansion, and therefore (<i>tc</i>) = 188°, or by direct observation 193°. For
silicon tetrachloride, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, the modulus equals 0·00136, from whence (<i>tc</i>) = 231°, and
by experiment 230°. On the other hand, D. P. Konovaloff, admitting that the external
pressure <i>p</i> in liquids is insignificant when compared with the internal (<i>a</i> in van der
Waals' formula), and that the work in the expansion of liquids is proportional to their
temperature (as in gases), directly deduced, from van der Waals' formula, the above-mentioned
formula for the expansion of liquids, V<sub>t</sub> = 1/(1 - K<i>t</i>), and also the magnitude
of the latent heat of evaporation, cohesion, and compressibility under pressure. In this
way van der Waals' formula embraces the gaseous, critical, and <i>liquid states</i> of substances,
and shows the connection between them. On this account, although van der
Waals' formula cannot be considered as perfectly general and accurate, yet it is not only
very much more exact than <i>pv</i> = <i>RT</i>, but it is also more comprehensive, because it
applies both to gases and liquids. Further research will naturally give a closer proximity
to truth, and will show the connection between composition and the constants (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>);
but a great scientific progress is seen in this form of the equation of state.</p>

<p>Clausius (in 1880), taking into consideration the variability of <i>a</i>, in van der Waals'
formula, with the temperature, gave the following equation of condition:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">(<i>p</i> +

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>a</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>T</i>(<i>v</i> + <i>c</i>)<sup>2</sup></span>
</span>

)(<i>v</i> - <i>b</i>) = <i>RT</i>.</p>

<p>Sarrau applied this formula to Amagat's data for hydrogen, and found <i>a</i> = 0·0551,
<i>c</i> = -0·00043, <i>b</i> = 0·00089, and therefore calculated its absolute boiling point as -174°, and
(<i>pc</i>) = 99 atmospheres. But as similar calculations for oxygen (-105°), nitrogen (-124°),
and marsh gas (-76°) gave <i>tc</i> higher than it really is, the absolute boiling point of hydrogen
must lie below -174°.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_159" id="Footnote_35_159"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_159"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> This and a number of similar cases clearly show how great are the internal
chemical forces compared with physical and mechanical forces.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_160" id="Footnote_36_160"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_160"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> The property of palladium of absorbing hydrogen, and of increasing in volume in
so doing, may be easily demonstrated by taking a sheet of palladium varnished on one
side, and using it as a cathode. The hydrogen which is evolved by the action of the
current is retained by the unvarnished surface, as a consequence of which the sheet curls
up. By attaching a pointer (for instance, a quill) to the end of the sheet this bending
effect is rendered strikingly evident, and on reversing the current (when oxygen will be
evolved and combine with the absorbed hydrogen, forming water) it may be shown that
on losing the hydrogen the palladium regains its original form.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_161" id="Footnote_37_161"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_161"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Deville discovered that iron and platinum become pervious to hydrogen at a red
heat. He speaks of this in the following terms:&mdash;&lsquo;The permeability of such homogeneous
substances as platinum and iron is quite different from the passage of gases through
such non-compact substances as clay and graphite. The permeability of metals depends
on their expansion, brought about by heat, and proves that metals and alloys have a
certain porosity.&rsquo; However, Graham proved that it is only hydrogen which is capable of
passing through the above-named metals in this manner. Oxygen, nitrogen, ammonia,
and many other gases, only pass through in extremely minute quantities. Graham
showed that at a red heat about 500 c.c. of hydrogen pass per minute through a surface
of one square metre of platinum 1·1 mm. thick, but that with other gases the amount
transmitted is hardly perceptible. Indiarubber has the same capacity for allowing the
transference of hydrogen through its substance (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>.), but at the ordinary
temperature one square metre, 0·014 mm. thick, transmits only 127 c.c. of hydrogen per
minute. In the experiment on the decomposition of water by heat in porous tubes, the
clay tube may be exchanged for a platinum one with advantage. Graham showed that
by placing a platinum tube containing hydrogen under these conditions, and surrounding
it by a tube containing air, the transference of the hydrogen may be observed by the
decrease of pressure in the platinum tube. In one hour almost all the hydrogen (97 p.c.)
had passed from the tube, without being replaced by air. It is evident that the occlusion
and passage of hydrogen through metals capable of occluding it are not only intimately
connected together, but are dependent on the capacity of metals to form compounds of
various degrees of stability with hydrogen&mdash;like salts with water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_162" id="Footnote_38_162"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_162"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> It appeared on further investigation that palladium gives a definite compound,
Pd<sub>2</sub>H (<i>see</i> further) with hydrogen; but what was most instructive was the investigation
of sodium hydride, Na<sub>2</sub>H, which clearly showed that the origin and properties of such
compounds are in entire accordance with the conceptions of dissociation.</p>

<p>Since hydrogen is a gas which is difficult to condense, it is little soluble in water and
other liquids. At 0° a hundred volumes of water dissolve 1·9 volume of hydrogen, and
alcohol 6·9 volumes measured at 0° and 760 mm. Molten iron absorbs hydrogen, but in
solidifying, it expels it. The solution of hydrogen by metals is to a certain degree
based on its affinity for metals, and must be likened to the solution of metals in mercury
and to the formation of alloys. In its chemical properties hydrogen, as we shall see
later, has much of a metallic character. Pictet (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_31_155">31</a>) even affirms that liquid
hydrogen has metallic properties. The metallic properties of hydrogen are also evinced
in the fact that it is a good conductor of heat, which is not the case with other gases
(Magnus).</p></div>

a platinum nozzle, as the glass end of a gas-conducting tube imparts a yellow tint to the
flame, owing to the presence of sodium in the glass.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_164" id="Footnote_40_164"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_164"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Let us imagine that a stream of hydrogen passes along a tube, and let us mentally
divide this stream into several parts, consecutively passing out from the orifice of the
tube. The first part is lighted&mdash;that is, brought to a state of incandescence, in which
state it combines with the oxygen of the atmosphere. A considerable amount of heat is
evolved in the combination. The heat evolved then, so to say, ignites the second part of
hydrogen coming from the tube, and, therefore, when once ignited, the hydrogen continues
to burn, if there be a continual supply of it, and if the atmosphere in which it
burns be unlimited and contains oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_165" id="Footnote_41_165"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_165"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> The combustibility of hydrogen may be shown by the direct decomposition of water
by sodium. If a pellet of sodium be thrown into a vessel containing water, it floats on
the water and evolves hydrogen, which may be lighted. The presence of sodium imparts
a yellow tint to the flame. If potassium be taken, the hydrogen bursts into flame spontaneously,
because sufficient heat is evolved in the reaction to ignite the hydrogen. The
flame is coloured violet by the potassium. If sodium be thrown not on to water, but on
to an acid, it will evolve more heat, and the hydrogen will then also burst into flame.
These experiments must be carried on with caution, as, sometimes towards the end, a
mass of sodium oxide (Note <a href="#Footnote_8_131">8</a>) is produced, and flies about; it is therefore best to cover
the vessel in which the experiment is carried on.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_166" id="Footnote_42_166"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_166"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> This property of spongy platinum is made use of in the so-called hydrogen cigar-lighter.
It consists of a glass cylinder or beaker, inside which there is a small lead stand
(which is not acted on by sulphuric acid), on which a piece of zinc is laid. This zinc is
covered by a bell, which is open at the bottom and furnished with a cock at the top.
Sulphuric acid is poured into the space between the bell and the sides of the outer glass
cylinder, and will thus compress the gas in the bell. If the cock of the cylinder be
opened the gas will escape by it, and will be replaced by the acid, which, coming into
contact with the zinc, evolves hydrogen, and it will escape through the cock. If the
cock be closed, then the hydrogen evolved will increase the pressure of the gas in the
bell, and thus again force the acid into the space between the bell and the walls of the
outer cylinder. Thus the action of the acid on the zinc may be stopped or started at
will by opening or shutting the cock, and consequently a stream of hydrogen may be
always turned on. Now, if a piece of spongy platinum be placed in this stream, the
hydrogen will take light, because the spongy platinum becomes hot in condensing the
hydrogen and inflames it. The considerable rise in temperature of the platinum depends,
among other things, on the fact that the hydrogen condensed in its pores comes into
contact with previously absorbed and condensed atmospheric oxygen, with which hydrogen
combines with great facility in this form. In this manner the hydrogen cigar-lighter
gives a stream of burning hydrogen when the cock is open. In order that it should work
regularly it is necessary that the spongy platinum should be quite clean, and it is best
enveloped in a thin sheet of platinum foil, which protects it from dust. In any case,
after some time it will be necessary to clean the platinum, which may be easily done by
boiling it in nitric acid, which does not dissolve the platinum, but clears it of all dirt.
This imperfection has given rise to several other forms, in which an electric spark is
made to pass before the orifice from which the hydrogen escapes. This is arranged in
such a manner that the zinc of a galvanic element is immersed when the cock is turned,
or a small coil giving a spark is put into circuit on turning the hydrogen on.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_167" id="Footnote_43_167"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_167"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Under conditions similar to those in which hydrogen combines with oxygen it is
also capable of combining with chlorine. A mixture of hydrogen and chlorine explodes
on the passage of an electric spark through it, or on contact with an incandescent substance,
and also in the presence of spongy platinum; but, besides this, the action of light
alone is enough to bring about the combination of hydrogen and chlorine. If a mixture
of equal volumes of hydrogen and chlorine be exposed to the action of sunlight, complete
combination rapidly ensues, accompanied by a report. Hydrogen does not combine
directly with carbon, either at the ordinary temperature or by the action of heat and
pressure. But if an electric current be passed through carbon electrodes at a short
distance from each other (as in the electric light or voltaic arc), so as to form an electric
arc in which the particles of carbon are carried from one pole to the other, then, in the
intense heat to which the carbon is subjected in this case, it is capable of combining
with hydrogen. A gas of peculiar smell called acetylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, is thus formed from
carbon and hydrogen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_168" id="Footnote_44_168"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_168"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> There is another explanation of the facility with which hydrogen reacts in a nascent
state. We shall afterwards learn that the molecule of hydrogen contains two atoms, H<sub>2</sub>,
but there are elements the molecules of which only contain one atom&mdash;for instance,
mercury. Therefore, every reaction of gaseous hydrogen must be accompanied by the
disruption of that bond which exists between the atoms forming a molecule. At the
moment of evolution, however, it is supposed that free atoms exist, and in this condition,
according to the hypothesis, act energetically. This hypothesis is not based upon facts,
and the idea that hydrogen is condensed at the moment of its evolution is more natural,
and is in accordance with the fact (Note <a href="#Footnote_12_135">12</a>) that compressed hydrogen displaces palladium
and silver (Brunner, Beketoff)&mdash;that is, acts as at the moment of its liberation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_BIS_169" id="Footnote_44_BIS_169"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_BIS_169"><span class="label">[44 bis]</span></a> There is a very intimate and evident relation between the phenomena which
take place in the action of spongy platinum and the phenomena of the action in a nascent
state. The combination of hydrogen with aldehyde may be taken as an example. Aldehyde
is a volatile liquid with an aromatic smell, boiling at 21°, soluble in water, and
absorbing oxygen from the atmosphere, and in this absorption forming acetic acid&mdash;the
substance which is found in ordinary vinegar. If sodium amalgam be thrown into an
aqueous solution of aldehyde, the greater part of the hydrogen evolved combines with
the aldehyde, forming alcohol&mdash;a substance also soluble in water, which forms
the principle of all spirituous liquors, boils at 78°, and contains the same amount of
oxygen and carbon as aldehyde, but more hydrogen. The composition of aldehyde is
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, that of alcohol C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_170" id="Footnote_45_170"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_170"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> When, for instance, an acid and zinc are added to a salt of silver, the silver is
reduced; but this may be explained as a reaction of the zinc, and not of the hydrogen at
the moment of its formation. There are, however, examples to which this explanation
is entirely inapplicable; thus, for instance, hydrogen, at the moment of its liberation
easily takes up oxygen from its compounds with nitrogen if they be in solution, and
converts the nitrogen into its hydrogen-compound. Here the nitrogen and hydrogen,
so to speak, meet at the moment of their liberation, and in this state combine together.</p>

<p>It is evident from this that the elastic gaseous state of hydrogen fixes the limit of its
energy: prevents it from entering into those combinations of which it is capable. In the
nascent state we have hydrogen which is not in a gaseous state, and its action is then
much more energetic. At the moment of evolution that heat, which would be latent in
the gaseous hydrogen, is transmitted to its molecules, and consequently they are in a
state of strain, and can hence act on many substances.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_171" id="Footnote_46_171"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_171"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> Several numerical data and reflections bearing on this matter are enumerated in
Notes 7, 9, and 11. It must be observed that the action of iron or zinc on water is reversible.
But the reaction CuO + H<sub>2</sub> = Cu + H<sub>2</sub>O is not reversible; the difference between
the degrees of affinity is very great in this case, and, therefore, so far as is at present
known, no hydrogen is liberated even in the presence of a large excess of water. It is
to be further remarked, that under the conditions of the dissociation of water, copper is
not oxidised by water, because the oxide of copper is reduced by free hydrogen. If a
definite amount of a metal and acid be taken and their reaction be carried on in a closed
space, then the evolution of hydrogen will cease, when its tension equals that at which
compressed hydrogen displaces the metal. The result depends upon the nature of the
metal and the strength of the solution of acid. Tammann and Nernst (1892) found that
the metals stand in the following order in respect to this limiting tension of hydrogen:&mdash;Na,
Mg, Zn, Al, Cd, Fe, Ni.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_172" id="Footnote_47_172"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_172"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> This determination may be carried on in an apparatus like that mentioned in
Note <a href="#Footnote_13_59">13</a> of Chapter I.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_48_173" id="Footnote_48_173"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_173"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> We will proceed to describe Dumas' method and results. For this determination
pure and dry copper oxide is necessary. Dumas took a sufficient quantity of copper
oxide for the formation of 50 grams of water in each determination. As the oxide of
copper was weighed before and after the experiment, and as the amount of oxygen contained
in water was determined by the difference between these weights, it was essential
that no other substance besides the oxygen forming the water should be evolved from
the oxide of copper during its ignition in hydrogen. It was necessary, also, that the
hydrogen should be perfectly pure, and free not only from traces of moisture, but from
any other impurities which might dissolve in the water or combine with the copper and
form some other compound with it. The bulb containing the oxide of copper (fig. <a href="#fig_26">26</a>),
which was heated to redness, should be quite free from air, as otherwise the oxygen in
the air might, in combining with the hydrogen passing through the vessel, form water
in addition to that formed by the oxygen of the oxide of copper. The water formed
should be entirely absorbed in order to accurately determine its quantity. The
hydrogen was evolved in the three-necked bottle. The sulphuric acid, for acting on the
zinc, is poured through funnels
into the middle neck. The hydrogen
evolved in the Woulfe's bottle
passes through U tubes, in which
it is purified, to the bulb, where
it comes into contact with the
copper oxide, forms water, and
reduces the oxide to metallic
copper; the water formed is condensed
in the second bulb, and
any passing off is absorbed in the
second set of U tubes. This is
the general arrangement of the
apparatus. The bulb with the
copper oxide is weighed before
and after the experiment. The
loss in weight shows the quantity
of oxygen which entered into the
composition of the water formed,
the weight of the latter being
shown by the gain in weight of
the absorbing apparatus. Knowing
the amount of oxygen in the
water formed, we also know the
quantity of hydrogen contained
in it, and consequently we determine
the composition of water by
weight. This is the essence of
the determination. We will now
turn to certain particulars. In
one neck of the three-necked
bottle a tube is placed dipping
under mercury. This serves as a
safety-valve to prevent the pressure
inside the apparatus becoming
too great from the rapid
evolution of hydrogen. If the
pressure rose to any considerable
extent, the current of gases
and vapours would be very rapid,
and, as a consequence, the hydrogen
would not be perfectly
purified, or the water entirely
absorbed in the tubes placed for
this purpose. In the third neck
of the Woulfe's bottle is a tube
conducting the hydrogen to the
purifying apparatus, consisting
of eight U tubes, destined for
the purification and testing of
the hydrogen. The hydrogen, evolved by zinc and sulphuric acid, is purified by
passing it first through a tube full of pieces of glass moistened with a solution of
lead nitrate next through silver sulphate; the lead nitrate retains sulphurette
hydrogen, and arseniuretted hydrogen is retained by the tube with silver sulphate.
Caustic potash in the next U tube retains any acid which might come over. The
two following tubes are filled with lumps of dry caustic potash in order to absorb
any carbonic anhydride and moisture which the hydrogen might contain. The next two
tubes, to remove the last traces of moisture, are filled with phosphoric anhydride, mixed
with lumps of pumice-stone. They are immersed in a freezing mixture. The small
U tube contains hygroscopic substances, and is weighed before the experiment: this is
in order to know whether the hydrogen passing through still retains any moisture. If it
does not, then the weight of this tube will not vary during the whole experiment, but
if the hydrogen evolved still retains moisture, the tube will increase in weight. The
copper oxide is placed in the bulb, which, previous to the experiment, is dried with the
copper oxide for a long period of time. The air is then exhausted from it, in order to
weigh the oxide of copper in a vacuum and to avoid the need of a correction for weighing
in air. The bulb is made of infusible glass, that it may be able to withstand a
lengthy (20 hours) exposure to a red heat without changing in form. The weighed bulb
is only connected with the purifying apparatus after the hydrogen has passed through
for a long time, and after experiment has shown that the hydrogen passing from the
purifying apparatus is pure and does not contain any air. On passing from the condensing
bulb the gas and vapour enter into an apparatus for absorbing the last traces of
moisture. The first U tube contains pieces of ignited potash, the second and third tubes
phosphoric anhydride or pumice-stone moistened with sulphuric acid. The last of the
two is employed for determining whether all the moisture is absorbed, and is therefore
weighed separately. The final tube only serves as a safety-tube for the whole apparatus,
in order that the external moisture should not penetrate into it. The glass cylinder
contains sulphuric acid, through which the excess of hydrogen passes; it enables the
rate at which the hydrogen is evolved to be judged, and whether its amount should be
decreased or increased.</p>

<p>When the apparatus is fitted up it must be seen that all its parts are hermetically
tight before commencing the experiment. When the previously weighed parts are connected
together and the whole apparatus put into communication, then the bulb containing
the copper oxide is heated with a spirit lamp (reduction does not take place without
the aid of heat), and the reduction of the copper oxide then takes place, and water is
formed. When nearly all the copper oxide is reduced the lamp is removed and the
apparatus allowed to cool, the current of hydrogen being kept up all the time. When
cool, the drawn-out end of the bulb is fused up, and the hydrogen remaining in it is
exhausted, in order that the copper may be again weighed in a vacuum. The absorbing
apparatus remains full of hydrogen, and would therefore present a less weight than if it
were full of air, as it was before the experiment, and for this reason, having disconnected
the copper oxide bulb, a current of dry air is passed through it until the gas passing from
the glass cylinder is quite free from hydrogen. The condensing bulb and the two tubes
next to it are then weighed, in order to determine the quantity of water formed. Dumas
repeated this experiment many times. The average result was that water contains
1253·3 parts of hydrogen per 10,000 parts of oxygen. Making a correction for the amount
of air contained in the sulphuric acid employed for producing the hydrogen, Dumas
obtained the average figure 1251·5, between the extremes 1247·2 and 1256·2. This
proves that per 1 part of hydrogen water contains 7·9904 parts of oxygen, with a possible
error of not more than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>250</sub>, or 0·03, in the amount of oxygen per 1 part of hydrogen.</p>

<p>Erdmann and Marchand, in eight determinations, found that per 10,000 parts of
oxygen water contains an average of 1,252 parts of hydrogen, with a difference of from
1,258·5 to 1,248·7; hence per 1 part of hydrogen there would be 7·9952 of oxygen, with an
error of at least 0·05.</p>

<p>Keiser (1888), in America by employing palladium hydride, and by introducing
various fresh precautions for obtaining accurate results, found the composition of water to
be 15·95 parts of oxygen per 2 of hydrogen.</p>

<p>Certain of the latest determinations of the composition of water, as also those made
by Dumas, always give less than 8, and on the average 7·98, of oxygen per 1 part of
hydrogen. However, not one of these figures is to be entirely depended on, and for
ordinary accuracy it may be considered that O = 16 when H = 1.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">OXYGEN AND THE CHIEF ASPECTS OF ITS SALINE COMBINATIONS</span></h2>

<p>On the earth's surface there is no other element which is so widely distributed
as oxygen in its various compounds.<a name="FNanchor_1_174" id="FNanchor_1_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_174" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It makes up eight-ninths
of the weight of water, which occupies the greater part of the earth's
surface. Nearly all earthy substances and rocks consist of compounds
of oxygen with metals and other elements. Thus, the greater part of
sand is formed of silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, which contains 53 p.c. of oxygen; clay
contains water, alumina (formed of aluminium and oxygen), and silica.
It may be considered that earthy substances and rocks contain up to
one-third of their weight of oxygen; animal and vegetable substances
are also very rich in oxygen. Without counting the water present in
them, plants contain up to 40, and animals up to 20 p.c. by weight of
oxygen. Thus, oxygen compounds predominate on the earth's surface.
Besides this, a portion exists in a free state, and is contained in admixture
with nitrogen in the atmosphere, forming about one-fourth of its
mass, or one-fifth of its volume.</p>

<p>Being so widely distributed in nature, oxygen plays a very important
part in it, for a number of the phenomena which take place
before us are mainly dependent on it. <i>Animals breathe</i> air in order
to obtain only <i>oxygen</i> from it, the oxygen entering into their respiratory
organs (the lungs of human beings and animals, the gills of fishes, and
the trachæ of insects); they, so to say, drink in air in order to absorb
the oxygen. The oxygen of the air (or dissolved in water) passes
through the membranes of the respiratory organs into the blood, is
retained in it by the blood corpuscles, is transmitted by their means
to all parts of the body, aids their transformations, bringing about
chemical processes in them, and chiefly extracting carbon from them
in the form of carbonic anhydride, the greater part of which passes
into the blood, is dissolved by it, and is thrown off by the lungs during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
the absorption of the oxygen. Thus, in the process of respiration
carbonic anhydride (and water) is given off, and the oxygen of the air
absorbed, by which means the blood is changed from a red venous
to a dark-red arterial blood. The cessation of this process causes
death, because then all those chemical processes, and the consequent
heat and work which the oxygen introduced into the system brought
about, cease. For this reason suffocation and death ensue in a vacuum,
or in a gas which does not contain free oxygen, <i>i.e.</i> which does not
support combustion. If an animal be placed in an atmosphere of free
oxygen, at first its movements are very active and a general invigoration
is remarked, but a reaction soon sets in, and death may ensue. The
oxygen of the air when it enters the lungs is diluted with four volumes
of nitrogen, which is not absorbed into the system, so that the blood
absorbs but a small quantity of oxygen from the air, whilst in an
atmosphere of pure oxygen a large quantity of oxygen would be
absorbed, and would produce a very rapid change of all parts of the
organism, and destroy it. From what has been said, it will be understood
that oxygen may be employed in respiration, at any rate for a
limited time, when the respiratory organs suffer under certain forms of
suffocation and impediment to breathing.<a name="FNanchor_2_175" id="FNanchor_2_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_175" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>The combustion of organic substances&mdash;that is, substances which
make up the composition of plants and animals&mdash;proceeds in the same
manner as the combustion of many inorganic substances, such as
sulphur, phosphorus, iron, &amp;c., from the combination of these substances
with oxygen, as was described in the Introduction. The decomposition,
rotting, and similar transformations of substances, which proceed
around us, are also very often dependent on the action of the oxygen
of the air, and also reduce it from a free to a combined state. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
majority of the compounds of oxygen are, like water, very stable, and
do not give up their oxygen under the ordinary conditions of nature.
As these processes are taking place everywhere, it might be expected
that the amount of free oxygen in the atmosphere should decrease,
and this decrease should proceed somewhat rapidly. This is, in fact,
observed where combustion or respiration proceeds in a closed space.
Animals suffocate in a closed space because in consuming the oxygen
the air remains unfit for respiration. In the same manner combustion,
after a time, ceases in a closed space, which may be proved by a very
simple experiment. An ignited substance&mdash;for instance, a piece of burning
sulphur&mdash;has only to be placed in a glass flask, which is then closed
with a stout cork to prevent the access of the external air; combustion
will proceed for a certain time, so long as the flask contains any
free oxygen, but it will cease when the oxygen of the enclosed air has
combined with the sulphur. From what has been said, it is evident
that regularity of combustion or respiration requires a constant renewal
of air&mdash;that is, that the burning substance or respiring animal should
have access to a fresh supply of oxygen. This is attained in dwellings
by having many windows, outlets, and ventilators, and by the current
of air produced by fires and stoves. As regards the air over the entire
earth's surface its amount of oxygen hardly decreases, because in
nature there is a process going on which renews the supply of free
oxygen. <i>Plants</i>, or rather their leaves, during daytime,<a name="FNanchor_3_176" id="FNanchor_3_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_176" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> under the
influence of light, absorb carbonic anhydride CO<sub>2</sub>, and <i>evolve free oxygen</i>.
Thus the loss of oxygen which occurs in consequence of the respiration
of animals and of combustion is made good by plants. If a leaf be
placed in a bell jar containing water, and carbonic anhydride (because
this gas is absorbed and oxygen evolved from it by plants) be passed
into the bell, and the whole apparatus placed in sunlight, then
oxygen will accumulate in the bell jar. This experiment was first
made by Priestley at the end of the last century. Thus the life of plants
on the earth not only serves for the formation of food for animals, but
also for keeping up a constant percentage of oxygen in the atmosphere.
In the long period of the life of the earth an equilibrium has been
attained between the processes absorbing and evolving oxygen, by
which a definite quantity of free oxygen is preserved in the entire mass
of the atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_4_177" id="FNanchor_4_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_177" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Oxygen was obtained as an independent gas in 1774 by Priestley in
England and in the same year by Scheele in Sweden, but its nature and
great importance were only perfectly elucidated by Lavoisier.</p>

<p>Free oxygen may be obtained by one or other method from all the
substances in which it occurs. Thus, for instance, the oxygen of many
substances may be transferred into water, from which, as we have
already seen, oxygen may be obtained.<a name="FNanchor_5_178" id="FNanchor_5_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_178" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> We will first consider the
methods of extracting oxygen from air as being a substance everywhere
distributed. The separation of oxygen from it is, however, hampered
by many difficulties.</p>

<p>From air, which contains a <i>mixture</i> of oxygen and nitrogen, the
nitrogen alone cannot be removed, because it has no inclination to
combine directly or readily with any substance; and although it does
combine with certain substances (boron, titanium), these substances
combine simultaneously with the oxygen of the atmosphere.<a name="FNanchor_6_179" id="FNanchor_6_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_179" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a><br /><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
oxygen may be separated from air by causing it to combine with substances
which may be easily decomposed by the action of heat, and, in
so doing, give up the oxygen absorbed&mdash;that is, by making use of reversible
reactions. Thus, for instance, the oxygen of the atmosphere
may be made to oxidise sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub> (by passing directly
over ignited spongy platinum), and to form sulphuric anhydride, or
sulphur trioxide, SO<sub>3</sub>; and this substance (which is a solid and volatile,
and therefore easily separated from the nitrogen and sulphurous
anhydride), on further heating, gives oxygen and sulphurous anhydride.
Caustic soda or lime extracts (absorbs) the sulphurous anhydride
from this mixture, whilst the oxygen is not absorbed, and thus it is
isolated from the air. On a large scale in works, as we shall afterwards
see, sulphurous anhydride is transformed into hydrate of sulphuric
trioxide, or sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>; if this is allowed to drop on to
red-hot flagstones, water, sulphurous anhydride, and oxygen are obtained.
The oxygen is easily isolated from this mixture by passing the gases
over lime. The extraction of oxygen from oxide of mercury (Priestley,
Lavoisier), which is obtained from mercury and the oxygen of the
atmosphere, is also a reversible reaction by which oxygen may be
obtained from the atmosphere. So also, by passing dry air through a
red-hot tube containing barium oxide, it is made to combine with the
oxygen of the air. In this reaction the so-called barium peroxide,
BaO<sub>2</sub>, is formed from the barium oxide, BaO, and at a higher temperature
the former evolves the absorbed oxygen, and leaves the barium
oxide originally taken.<a name="FNanchor_7_180" id="FNanchor_7_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_180" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>Oxygen is evolved with particular ease by a whole series of unstable
oxygen compounds, of which we shall proceed to take a general survey,
remarking that many of these reactions, although not all, belong to the
number of reversible reactions;<a name="FNanchor_8_181" id="FNanchor_8_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_181" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> so that in order to obtain many of
these substances (for instance, potassium chlorate) rich in oxygen,
recourse must be had to indirect methods (see <a href="#Page_1">Introduction</a>) with
which we shall become acquainted in the course of this book.</p>

<p>1. <i>The compounds of oxygen</i> with certain metals, and especially
with the so-called noble metals&mdash;that is, mercury, silver, gold, and
platinum&mdash;having once been obtained, retain their oxygen at the ordinary
temperature, but part with it at a red heat. The compounds are
solids, generally amorphous and infusible, and are easily decomposed by
heat into the metal and oxygen. We have seen an example of this in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
speaking of the decomposition of mercury oxide. Priestley, in 1774,
obtained pure oxygen for the first time by heating mercury oxide by
means of a burning-glass, and clearly showed its difference from air.
He showed its characteristic property of supporting combustion &lsquo;with
remarkable vigour,&rsquo; and named it dephlogisticated air.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 29.&mdash;Preparation of oxygen from manganese peroxide and sulphuric acid. The gas evolved
is passed through a Woulfe's bottle containing caustic potash.</p></div>

<p>2. The substances called <i>peroxides</i><a name="FNanchor_9_182" id="FNanchor_9_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_182" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> evolve oxygen at a greater or
less heat (and also by the action of many acids). They usually contain
metals combined with a large quantity of oxygen. Peroxides are the
highest oxides of certain metals; those metals which form them generally
give several compounds with oxygen. Those of the lowest degrees
of oxidation, containing the least amount of oxygen, are generally substances
which are capable of easily reacting with acids&mdash;for instance,
with sulphuric acid. Such low oxides are called bases. Peroxides
contain more oxygen than the bases formed by the same metals. For
example, lead oxide contains 7·1 parts of oxygen in 100 parts, and is
basic, but lead peroxide contains 13·3 parts of oxygen in 100 parts.
<i>Manganese peroxide</i> is a similar substance, and is a solid of a dark
colour, which occurs in nature. It is employed for technical purposes
under the name of black oxide of manganese (in German, &lsquo;Braunstein,&rsquo;
the pyrolusite of the mineralogist). Peroxides are able to evolve
oxygen at a more or less elevated temperature. They do not then part
with all their oxygen, but with only a portion of it, and are converted
into a lower oxide or base. Thus, for example, lead peroxide, on heating,
gives oxygen and lead oxide. The decomposition of this peroxide
proceeds tolerably easily on heating, even in a glass vessel, but manganese
peroxide only evolves oxygen at a strong red heat, and therefore oxygen
can only be obtained from it in iron, or other metallic, or clay vessels.
This was formerly the method for obtaining oxygen. Manganese
peroxide only parts with one-third of its oxygen (according to the
equation 3MnO<sub>2</sub> = Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>), whilst two-thirds remain in the solid
substance which forms the residue after heating. Metallic peroxides
are also capable of evolving oxygen on heating with sulphuric acid.
They then evolve just that amount of oxygen which is in excess of
that necessary for the formation of the base, the latter reacting on
the sulphuric acid forming a compound (salt) with it. Thus barium
peroxide, when heated with sulphuric acid, forms oxygen and barium
oxide, which gives a compound with sulphuric acid termed barium
sulphate (BaO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = BaSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + O).<a name="FNanchor_9_BIS_183" id="FNanchor_9_BIS_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_BIS_183" class="fnanchor">[9 bis]</a> This reaction usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
proceeds with greater ease than the decomposition of peroxides by heat
alone. For the purposes of experiment powdered manganese peroxide is
usually taken and mixed with strong sulphuric acid in a flask, and the
apparatus set up as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig_28">28</a>. The gas which is evolved is
passed through a Woulfe's bottle containing a solution of caustic potash,
to purify it from carbonic anhydride and chlorine, which accompany the
evolution of oxygen from commercial manganese peroxide, and the gas is
not collected until a thin smouldering taper placed in front of the escape
orifice bursts into flame, which shows that the gas coming off is oxygen.
By this method of decomposition of the manganese peroxide by sulphuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
acid there is evolved, not, as in heating, one-third, but one-half of
the oxygen contained in the peroxide (MnO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = MnSO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O
+ O)&mdash;that is, from 50 grams of peroxide about 7&#8533; grams, or about 5&frac12;
litres, of oxygen,<a name="FNanchor_10_184" id="FNanchor_10_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_184" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> whilst by heating only about 3&frac12; litres are obtained.
The chemists of Lavoisier's time generally obtained oxygen by heating
manganese peroxide. At the present time more convenient methods
are known.</p>

<p>3. A third source to which recourse may be had for obtaining
oxygen is represented in <i>acids</i> and <i>salts</i> containing much oxygen,
which are capable, by parting with a portion or all of their oxygen,
of being converted into other compounds (lower products of oxidation)
which are more difficultly decomposed. These acids and salts (like
peroxides) evolve oxygen either on heating alone, or only when in the
presence of some other substance. Sulphuric acid may be taken as an
example of an acid which is decomposed by the action of heat alone,<a name="FNanchor_11_185" id="FNanchor_11_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_185" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
for it breaks up at a red heat into water, sulphurous anhydride, and
oxygen, as was mentioned before. Priestley, in 1772, and Scheele,
somewhat later, obtained oxygen by heating nitre to a red heat. The
best examples of the formation of oxygen by the heating of salts is
given in <i>potassium chlorate</i>, or Berthollet's salt, so called after the
French chemist who discovered it. Potassium chlorate is a salt composed
of the elements potassium, chlorine, and oxygen, KClO<sub>3</sub>. It
occurs as transparent colourless plates, is soluble in water, especially in
hot water, and resembles common table salt in some of its reactions and
physical properties; it melts on heating, and in melting begins to decompose,
evolving oxygen gas. This decomposition ends in all the oxygen
being evolved from the potassium chlorate, potassium chloride being
left as a residue, according to the equation KClO<sub>3</sub> = KCl + O<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_12_186" id="FNanchor_12_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_186" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
decomposition proceeds at a temperature which allows of its being
conducted in a glass vessel. However, in decomposing, the molten
potassium chlorate swells up and boils, and gradually solidifies, so the
evolution of the oxygen is not regular, and the glass vessel may crack.
In order to overcome this inconvenience, the potassium chlorate is
crushed and mixed with a powder of a substance which is infusible,
incapable of combining with the oxygen evolved, and is a good conductor
of heat. Usually it is mixed with manganese peroxide.<a name="FNanchor_13_187" id="FNanchor_13_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_187" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The decomposition
of the potassium chlorate is then considerably facilitated, and
proceeds at a lower temperature (because the entire mass is then better
heated, both externally and internally), without swelling up, and this
method is therefore more convenient than the decomposition of the salt
alone. This method for the preparation of oxygen is very convenient;
it is generally employed when a small quantity of oxygen is required.
Further, potassium chlorate is easily obtained pure, and it evolves
much oxygen. 100 grams of the salt give as much as 39 grams, or
30 litres, of oxygen. This method is so simple and easy,<a name="FNanchor_14_188" id="FNanchor_14_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_188" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> that a
course of practical chemistry is often commenced by the preparation
of oxygen by this method, and of hydrogen by the aid of zinc and
sulphuric acid, since by means of these gases many interesting and
striking experiments may be performed.<a name="FNanchor_15_189" id="FNanchor_15_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_189" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>A solution of <i>bleaching powder</i>, which contains calcium hypochlorite,
CaCl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, evolves oxygen on gently heating when a small quantity of
certain oxides is added&mdash;for instance, cobalt oxide, which in this case
acts by contact (<i>see</i> Introduction). When heated by itself, a solution
of bleaching powder does not evolve oxygen, but it oxidises the cobalt
oxide to a higher degree of oxidation; this higher oxide of cobalt in
contact with the bleaching powder decomposes into oxygen and lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
oxidation products, and the resultant lower oxide of cobalt with bleaching
powder again gives the higher oxide, which again gives up its
oxygen, and so on.<a name="FNanchor_16_190" id="FNanchor_16_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_190" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The calcium hypochlorite is here decomposed
according to the equation CaCl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = CaCl<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>. In this manner a
small quantity of cobalt oxide<a name="FNanchor_17_191" id="FNanchor_17_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_191" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> is sufficient for the decomposition of an
indefinitely large quantity of bleaching powder.</p>

<p><i>The properties of oxygen.</i><a name="FNanchor_18_192" id="FNanchor_18_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_192" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>&mdash;It is a permanent <i>gas</i>&mdash;that is, it cannot
be liquefied by pressure at the ordinary temperature, and further,
is only liquefied with difficulty (although more easily than hydrogen) at
temperatures below -120°, because this is its absolute boiling point.
As its critical pressure<a name="FNanchor_19_193" id="FNanchor_19_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_193" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is about 50 atmospheres, it can be easily liquefied
under pressures greater than 50 atmospheres at temperatures
below -120°. According to Dewar, the density of oxygen in a critical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
state is 0·65 (water = 1), but, like all other substances in this state,<a name="FNanchor_20_194" id="FNanchor_20_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_194" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> it
varies considerably in density with a change of pressure and temperature,
and therefore many investigators who made their observations
under high pressures give a greater density, as much as 1·1. Liquefied
oxygen is an exceedingly mobile transparent liquid, with a faint blue
tint and boiling (tension = 1 atmosphere) about -180°. Oxygen, like
all gases, is transparent, and like the majority of gases, colourless. It
has no smell or taste, which is evident from the fact of its being a component
of air. The weight of one litre of oxygen gas at 0° and 760 mm.
pressure is 1·4298 gram; it is therefore slightly denser than air.
Its density in respect to air = 1·1056 and in respect to hydrogen = 16.<a name="FNanchor_21_195" id="FNanchor_21_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_195" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

phosphorus, sodium, &amp;c., in oxygen.</p></div>

<p>In its chemical properties oxygen is remarkable from the fact that
it very easily&mdash;and, in a chemical sense, vigorously&mdash;reacts on a number
of substances, forming oxygen compounds. However, only a few
substances and mixtures of substances (for example, phosphorus, copper
with ammonia, decomposing organic matter, aldehyde, pyrogallol with
an alkali, &amp;c.) combine directly with oxygen at the ordinary temperature,
whilst many substances easily combine with oxygen at a red
heat, and often this combination presents a rapid chemical reaction
accompanied by the evolution of a large quantity of heat. Every
reaction which takes place rapidly, if it be accompanied by so great an
evolution of heat as to produce incandescence, is termed <i>combustion</i>.
Thus combustion ensues when many metals are plunged into chlorine,
or oxide of sodium or barium into carbonic anhydride, or when a spark
falls on gunpowder. A great many substances are combustible in
oxygen, and, owing to its presence, in air also. In order to start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
combustion it is generally necessary<a name="FNanchor_22_196" id="FNanchor_22_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_196" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that the combustible substance
should be brought to a state of incandescence. The continuation of the
process does not require the aid of fresh external heat, because sufficient
heat<a name="FNanchor_23_197" id="FNanchor_23_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_197" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is evolved to raise the temperature of the remaining parts of the
combustible substance to the required degree. Examples of this are
familiar to all from every-day experience. Combustion proceeds in
oxygen with greater rapidity, and is accompanied by a more powerful
incandescence, than in ordinary air. This may be demonstrated by a
number of very convincing experiments. If a piece of charcoal,
attached to a wire and previously brought to red-heat, be plunged into
a flask full of oxygen, it burns rapidly at a
white heat&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it combines with the oxygen,
forming a gaseous product of combustion
called carbonic anhydride, or carbonic
acid gas, CO<sub>2</sub>. This is the same gas that is
evolved in the act of respiration, for charcoal
is one of the substances which is obtained by
the decomposition of all organic substances
which contain it, and in the process of respiration
part of the constituents of the body,
so to speak, slowly burn. If a piece of
burning sulphur be placed in a small cup
attached to a wire and introduced into a
flask full of oxygen, then the sulphur, which burns in air with a
very feeble flame, burns in the oxygen with a violet flame, which,
although pale, is much larger than in air. If the sulphur be exchanged
for a piece of phosphorus,<a name="FNanchor_24_198" id="FNanchor_24_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_198" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> then, unless the phosphorus be
heated, it combines very slowly with the oxygen; but, if heated,
although on only one spot, it burns with an exceedingly brilliant white
flame. In order to heat the phosphorus inside the flask, the simplest
way is to bring a red-hot wire into contact with it. Before the charcoal
can burn, it must be brought to a state of incandescence. Sulphur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
also will not burn under 100°, whilst phosphorus inflames at 40°.
Phosphorus which has been already lighted in air cannot so well be
introduced into the flask, because it burns very rapidly and with a large
flame in air. If a small lump of metallic <i>sodium</i> be put in a small cup
made of lime,<a name="FNanchor_25_199" id="FNanchor_25_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_199" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> melted, and ignited,<a name="FNanchor_26_200" id="FNanchor_26_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_200" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> it burns very feebly in air. But
if burning sodium be introduced into oxygen, the combustion is invigorated
and is accompanied by a brighter yellow flame. Metallic
<i>magnesium</i>, which burns brightly in air, continues to burn with
still greater vigour in oxygen, forming a white powder, which is a
compound of magnesium with oxygen (magnesium oxide; magnesia).
A strip of <i>iron</i> or steel does not burn in
air, but an iron wire or steel spring may
be easily burnt in oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_27_201" id="FNanchor_27_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_201" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The combustion
of steel or iron in oxygen is not accompanied
by a flame, but sparks of oxide fly in
all directions from the burning portions of
the iron.<a name="FNanchor_28_202" id="FNanchor_28_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_202" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>In order to demonstrate by experiment
the <i>combustion of hydrogen</i> in oxygen, a
gas-conducting tube, bent so as to form
a convenient jet, is led from the vessel
evolving hydrogen. The hydrogen is first
set light to in air, and then the gas-conducting
tube is let down into a flask containing oxygen. The combustion
in oxygen will be similar to that in air; the flame remains pale,
notwithstanding the fact that its temperature rises considerably. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
instructive to remark that oxygen may burn in hydrogen, just as
hydrogen in oxygen. In order to show the combustion of oxygen in
hydrogen, a tube bent vertically upwards and ending in a fine orifice
is attached to the stopcock of a gas-holder full of oxygen. Two wires,
placed at such a distance from each other as to allow the passage of a
constant series of sparks from a Ruhmkorff's coil, are fixed in front of
the orifice of the tube. This is in order to ignite the oxygen, which may
also be done by attaching tinder round the orifice, and burning it. When
the wires are arranged at the orifice of the tube, and a series of sparks
passes between them, then an inverted (because of the lightness of the
hydrogen) jar full of hydrogen is placed over the gas-conducting tube.
When the jar covers the orifice of the gas-conducting tube (and not
before, as otherwise an explosion might take place) the cock of the gasometer
is opened, and the oxygen flows into the hydrogen and is set light
to by the sparks. The flame obtained is similar to that formed by the
combustion of hydrogen in oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_29_203" id="FNanchor_29_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_203" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> From this it is evident that the
flame is the locality where the oxygen combines with the hydrogen,
therefore a flame of burning oxygen can be obtained as well as a flame
of burning hydrogen.</p>

<p>If, instead of hydrogen, any other combustible gas be taken&mdash;for
example, ordinary coal gas&mdash;then the phenomenon of combustion will
be exactly the same, only a bright flame will be obtained, and the
products of combustion will be different. However, as coal gas contains
a considerable amount of free and combined hydrogen, it will also
form a considerable quantity of water in its combustion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>If hydrogen be mixed with oxygen in the proportion in which they
form water&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> if two volumes of hydrogen be taken for each
volume of oxygen&mdash;then the mixture will be the same as that obtained
by the decomposition of water
by a galvanic current&mdash;detonating
gas.</p>

<p>We have already mentioned
in the last <a href="#Page_113">chapter</a>
that the combination of these
gases, or their explosion, may
be brought about by the
action of an electric spark,
because the spark heats the
space through which it passes,
and acts consequently in a
manner similar to ignition by
means of contact with an incandescent
or burning substance.<a name="FNanchor_29_BIS_204" id="FNanchor_29_BIS_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_BIS_204" class="fnanchor">[29 bis]</a>
Cavendish made
this experiment on the ignition
of detonating gas, at the end
of the last century, in the
apparatus shown in fig. <a href="#fig_31">31</a>.
Ignition by the aid of the
electric spark is convenient,
for the reason that it may
then be brought about in a
closed vessel, and hence chemists
still employ this method
when it is required to ignite
a mixture of oxygen with a combustible gas in a closed vessel. For this
purpose, especially since Bunsen's time,<a name="FNanchor_30_205" id="FNanchor_30_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_205" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> an <i>eudiometer</i> is employed.
It consists of a thick glass tube graduated along its length in millimetres
(for indicating the height of the mercury column), and calibrated
for a definite volume (weight of mercury). Two platinum wires are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
fused into the upper closed end of the tube, as shown in fig. <a href="#fig_32">32</a>.<a name="FNanchor_31_206" id="FNanchor_31_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_206" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> By
the aid of the eudiometer we may not only determine the volumetric
composition of water,<a name="FNanchor_32_207" id="FNanchor_32_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_207" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and the quantitative contents of oxygen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
air,<a name="FNanchor_33_208" id="FNanchor_33_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_208" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but also make a number of experiments explaining the phenomenon
of combustion.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, it may be demonstrated, by the aid of the
eudiometer, that for the ignition of detonating gas, a <i>definite temperature</i>
is required. If the temperature be below that required, combination
will not take place, but if at any spot within the tube it rises to the
temperature of inflammation, then combination will ensue at that spot,
and evolve enough heat for the ignition of the adjacent portions of the
detonating mixture. If to 1 volume of detonating gas there be added
10 volumes of oxygen, or 4 volumes of hydrogen, or 3 volumes of
carbonic anhydride, then we shall not obtain an explosion by passing
a spark through the diluted mixture. This depends on the fact that
the temperature falls with the dilution of the detonating gas by another
gas, because the heat evolved by the combination of the small quantity
of hydrogen and oxygen brought to incandescence by the spark is not
only transmitted to the water proceeding from the combination, but
also to the foreign substance mixed with the detonating gas.<a name="FNanchor_34_209" id="FNanchor_34_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_209" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The
necessity of a definite temperature for the ignition of detonating gas is
also seen from the fact that pure detonating gas explodes in the presence
of a red-hot iron wire, or of charcoal heated to 275°, but with a lower
degree of incandescence there is not any explosion. It may also be
brought about by rapid compression, when, as is known, heat is evolved.<a name="FNanchor_35_210" id="FNanchor_35_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_210" class="fnanchor">[35]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a><br /><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Experiments made in the eudiometer showed that the ignition of
detonating gas takes place at a temperature between 450° and
560°.<a name="FNanchor_36_211" id="FNanchor_36_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_211" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>The combination of hydrogen with oxygen is accompanied by the
evolution of a very considerable amount of heat; according to the
determinations of <i>Favre</i> and <i>Silbermann</i>,<a name="FNanchor_37_212" id="FNanchor_37_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_212" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> 1 part by weight of hydrogen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
in forming water evolves 34,462 units of heat. Many of the most
recent determinations are very close to this figure, so that it may be
taken that in the formation of 18 parts of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) there are evolved
69 major calories, or 69,000 units of heat.<a name="FNanchor_38_213" id="FNanchor_38_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_213" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> <i>If the specific heat of</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
<i>aqueous vapour</i> (0·48) <i>remained constant from the ordinary temperature
to that at which the combustion of detonating gas takes place</i> (but there
is now no doubt that it increases), were the combustion concentrated
at one point<a name="FNanchor_39_214" id="FNanchor_39_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_214" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> (but it occurs in the whole region of a flame), were there
no loss from radiation and heat conduction, and <i>did dissociation not
take place</i>&mdash;that is, did not a state of equilibrium between the hydrogen,
oxygen, and water come about&mdash;<i>then it would be possible to calculate
the temperature of the flame of detonating gas</i>. It would then be 8,000°.<a name="FNanchor_40_215" id="FNanchor_40_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_215" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
In reality it is very much lower, but it is nevertheless higher than the
temperature attained in furnaces and flames, and is as high as 2,000°.
The explosion of detonating gas is explained by this high temperature,
because the aqueous vapour formed must occupy a volume at least
5 times greater than that occupied by the detonating gas at the ordinary
temperature. Detonating gas emits a sound, not only as a consequence
of the commotion which occurs from the rapid expansion of
the heated vapour, but also because it is immediately followed by a
cooling effect, the conversion of the vapour into water, and a rapid
contraction.<a name="FNanchor_41_216" id="FNanchor_41_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_216" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p class="caption" style="width: 275px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 34.&mdash;Safety burner for detonating
gas, described in text.</p></div>

<p>Mixtures of hydrogen and of various other gases with oxygen
are taken advantage of for obtaining high temperatures. By the
aid of such high temperatures metals like platinum may be melted
on a large scale, which cannot be performed in furnaces heated with
charcoal and fed by a current of air. The burner, shown in fig. <a href="#fig_34">34</a>, is
constructed for the application of detonating gas to the purpose. It
consists of two brass tubes, one fixed inside the other, as shown in the
drawing. The internal central tube C C conducts oxygen, and the
outside, enveloping, tube E' E' conducts
hydrogen. Previous to their egress the
gases do not mix together, so that
there can be no explosion inside the
apparatus. When this burner is in
use C is connected with a gas-holder
containing oxygen, and E with a gas-holder
containing hydrogen (or sometimes
coal-gas). The flow of the gases
can be easily regulated by the stopcocks
O H. The flame is shortest and
evolves the greatest heat when the
gases burning are in the proportion of
1 volume of oxygen to 2 volumes of
hydrogen. The degree of heat may be
easily judged from the fact that a thin
platinum wire placed in the flame of a
properly proportioned mixture easily
melts. By placing the burner in the
orifice of a hollow piece of lime, a crucible A B is obtained in which
the platinum may be easily melted, even in large quantities if the
current of oxygen and hydrogen be sufficiently great (Deville). The
flame of detonating gas may also be used for illuminating purposes.
It is by itself very pale, but owing to its high temperature it may
serve for rendering infusible objects incandescent, and at the very
high temperature produced by the detonating gas the incandescent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
substance gives a most intense light. For this purpose lime, magnesia,
or oxide of zirconium are used, as they are not fusible at
the very high temperature evolved by the detonating gas. A small
cylinder of lime placed in the flame of detonating gas, if regulated to
the required point, gives a very brilliant white light, which was at one
time proposed for illuminating lighthouses. At present in the majority
of cases the electric light, owing to its constancy and other advantages,
has replaced it for this purpose. The light produced by the incandescence
of lime in detonating gas is called the <i>Drummond light</i> or
<i>limelight</i>.</p>

<p>The above cases form examples of the combustion of elements in
oxygen, but exactly similar phenomena are observed in the <i>combustion
of compounds</i>. So, for instance, the solid, colourless, shiny substance,
naphthalene, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, burns in the air with a smoky flame, whilst in
oxygen it continues to burn with a very brilliant flame. Alcohol, oil,
and other substances burn brilliantly in oxygen on conducting the
oxygen by a tube to the flame of lamps burning these substances. A
high temperature is thus evolved, which is sometimes taken advantage
of in chemical practice.</p>

<p>In order to understand why combustion in oxygen proceeds more
rapidly, and is accompanied by a more intense heat effect, than combustion
in air, it must be recollected that air is oxygen diluted with
nitrogen, which does not support combustion, and therefore fewer particles
of oxygen flow to the surface of a substance burning in air than
when burning in pure oxygen, besides which the reason of the intensity
of combustion in oxygen is the high temperature acquired by the substance
burning in it.<a name="FNanchor_41_BIS_217" id="FNanchor_41_BIS_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_BIS_217" class="fnanchor">[41 bis]</a></p>

<p class="caption" style="width: 275px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 35.&mdash;Faraday's experiment for investigating the
different parts of a candle flame.</p></div>

<p>Among the phenomena accompanying the combustion of certain
substances, the <i>phenomenon of flame</i> attracts attention. Sulphur,
phosphorus, sodium, magnesium, naphthalene, &amp;c., burn like hydrogen
with a flame, whilst in the combustion of other substances no flame is
observed, as, for instance, in the combustion of iron and of charcoal.
The appearance of flame depends on the capacity of the combustible
substance to yield gases or vapours at the temperature of combustion.
At the temperature of combustion, sulphur, phosphorus, sodium, and
naphthalene pass into vapour, whilst wood, alcohol, oil, &amp;c., are decomposed
into gaseous and vaporous substances. The combustion of gases
and vapours forms flames, and therefore <i>a flame is composed of the hot
and incandescent gases and vapours produced by combustion</i>. It may
easily be proved that the flames of such non-volatile substances as wood
contain volatile and combustible substances formed from them, by
placing a tube in the flame connected with an aspirator. Besides the
products of combustion, combustible gases and liquids, previously in the
flame as vapours, collect in the aspirator. For this experiment to
succeed&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in order to really extract combustible gases and vapours
from the flame it is necessary that the suction tube should be placed
<i>inside</i> the flame. The combustible gases and vapours can only remain
unburnt inside the flame, for at the surface of the flame they come into
contact with the oxygen of the air and burn.<a name="FNanchor_42_218" id="FNanchor_42_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_218" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Flames are of different
degrees of <i>brilliancy</i>, according to whether <i>solid</i> incandescent particles
occur in the combustible gas or vapour, or not. Incandescent gases
and vapours emit but little light by themselves, and therefore give a
paler flame.<a name="FNanchor_43_219" id="FNanchor_43_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_219" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> If a flame does not contain solid particles it is transparent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
pale, and emits but little light.<a name="FNanchor_44_220" id="FNanchor_44_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_220" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The flames of burning
alcohol, sulphur, and hydrogen are of this kind. A pale flame may be
rendered luminous by placing fine particles of solid matter in it. Thus,
if a very fine platinum wire be placed in the pale flame of burning
alcohol&mdash;or, better still, of hydrogen&mdash;the flame emits a bright light.
This is still better seen
by sifting the powder of
an incombustible substance,
such as fine sand, into the
flame, or by placing a bunch
of asbestos threads in it.
Every brilliant flame always
contains some kind of solid
particles, or at least some
very dense vapour. The
flame of sodium burning
in oxygen has a brilliant
yellow colour, from the
presence of particles of solid
sodium oxide. The flame
of magnesium is brilliant
from the fact that in burning
it forms solid magnesia,
which becomes white hot,
and similarly the brilliancy
of the Drummond light is
due to the heat of the flame raising the solid non-volatile lime to a
state of incandescence. The flames of a candle, wood, and similar substances
are brilliant, because they contain particles of charcoal or soot.
It is not the flame itself which is luminous, but the incandescent soot
it contains. These particles of charcoal which occur in flames may be
easily observed by introducing a cold object, like a knife, into the
flame.<a name="FNanchor_45_221" id="FNanchor_45_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_221" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The particles of charcoal burn at the outer surface of the
flame if the supply of air be sufficient, but if the supply of air&mdash;that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
of oxygen&mdash;be insufficient for their combustion the flame smokes, because
the unconsumed particles of charcoal are carried off by the current of
air.<a name="FNanchor_46_222" id="FNanchor_46_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_222" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>The combination of various substances with oxygen may not
present any signs of combustion&mdash;that is, the temperature may rise
but inconsiderably. This may either proceed from the fact that the
reaction of the substance (for example, tin, mercury, lead at a high
temperature, or a mixture of pyrogallol with caustic potash at the
ordinary temperature) evolves but little heat, or that the heat
evolved is transmitted to good conductors of heat, like metals, or that
the combination with oxygen takes place so slowly that the heat
evolved succeeds in passing to the surrounding objects. Combustion
is only a particular, intense, and evident case of combination with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
oxygen. Respiration is also an act of combination with oxygen;
it also serves, like combustion, for the development of heat by those
chemical processes which accompany it (the transformation of oxygen
into carbonic anhydride). Lavoisier enunciated this in the lucid expression,
&lsquo;respiration is slow combustion.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Reactions involving slow combination of substances with oxygen
are termed <i>oxidations</i>. Combination of this kind (and also combustion)
often results in the formation of acid substances, and hence the
name <i>oxygen</i> (<i>Sauerstoff</i>). Combustion is only rapid oxidation.
Phosphorus, iron, and wine may be taken as examples of substances
which slowly oxidise in air at the ordinary temperature. If such a
substance be left in contact with a definite volume of air or oxygen, it
absorbs the oxygen little by little, as may be seen by the decrease in
volume of the gas. This slow oxidation is not often accompanied by
a sensible evolution of heat; an evolution of heat really does occur, only
it is not apparent to our senses owing to the small rise in temperature
which takes place; this is owing to the slow rate of the reaction and
to the transmission of the heat formed as radiant heat, &amp;c. Thus, in
the oxidation of wine and its transformation into vinegar by the usual
method of preparation of the latter, the heat evolved cannot be observed
because it extends over several weeks, but in the so-called rapid process
of the manufacture of vinegar, when a large quantity of wine is
comparatively rapidly oxidised, the evolution of heat is quite apparent.</p>

<p>Such slow processes of oxidation are always taking place in nature
by the action of the atmosphere. Dead organisms and the substances
obtained from them&mdash;such as bodies of animals, wood, wool, grass, &amp;c.&mdash;are
especially subject to this action. They <i>rot</i> and <i>decompose</i>&mdash;that is,
their solid matter is transformed into gases, under the influence of
moisture and atmospheric oxygen, and generally under the influence of
other organisms, such as moulds, worms, micro-organisms (bacteria),
and the like. These are processes of slow combustion, of slow combination
with oxygen. It is well known that manure rots and
develops heat, that stacks of damp hay, damp flour, straw, &amp;c., become
heated and are changed in the process.<a name="FNanchor_47_223" id="FNanchor_47_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_223" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> In all these transformations
the same chief products of combustion are formed as those which are
contained in smoke; the carbon gives carbonic anhydride, and the
hydrogen water. Hence these processes require oxygen just like combustion.
This is the reason why the entire prevention of access of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
air hinders these transformations,<a name="FNanchor_48_224" id="FNanchor_48_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_224" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and an increased supply of air
accelerates them. The mechanical treatment of arable lands by the
plough, harrow, and other similar means has not only the object of
facilitating the spread of roots in the ground, and of making the soil
more permeable to water, but it also serves to facilitate the access of
the air to the component parts of the soil; as a consequence of which
the organic remains of soil rot&mdash;so to speak, breathe air and evolve
carbonic anhydride. One acre of good garden land in the course of a
summer evolves more than sixteen tons of carbonic anhydride.</p>

<p>It is not only vegetable and animal substances which are subject to
slow oxidation in the presence of water. Some metals even rust under
these conditions. Copper very easily absorbs oxygen in the presence of
acids. Many metallic sulphides (for example, pyrites) are very easily
oxidised with access of air and moisture. Thus processes of slow
oxidation proceed throughout nature. However, there are many elements
which do not under any circumstances combine directly with
gaseous oxygen; nevertheless their compounds with oxygen may be
obtained. Platinum, gold, iridium, chlorine, and iodine are examples
of such elements. In this case recourse is had to a so-called <i>indirect
method</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the given substance is combined with another element,
and by a method of double decomposition this element is replaced by
oxygen. Substances which do not directly combine with oxygen, but
form compounds with it by an indirect method, often readily lose
the oxygen which they had absorbed by double decomposition or
at the moment of its evolution. Such, for example, are the compounds
of oxygen with chlorine, nitrogen, and platinum, which evolve
oxygen on heating&mdash;that is, they may be used as oxidising agents. In
this respect <i>oxidising agents</i>, or those compounds of oxygen which are
employed in chemical and technical practice for transferring oxygen
to other substances, are especially remarkable. The most important
among these is nitric acid or <i>aqua fortis</i>&mdash;a substance rich in oxygen,
and capable of evolving it when heated, which easily oxidises a great
number of substances. Thus nearly all metals and organic substances
containing carbon and hydrogen are more or less oxidised when heated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
with nitric acid. If strong nitric acid be taken, and a piece of burning
charcoal be immersed in the acid, it continues to burn. Chromic acid
acts like nitric acid; alcohol burns when mixed with it. Although
the action is not so marked, even water may oxidise with its oxygen.
Sodium is not oxidised in perfectly dry oxygen at the ordinary temperature,
but it burns very easily in water and aqueous vapour.
Charcoal can burn in carbonic anhydride&mdash;a product of combustion&mdash;forming
carbonic oxide. Magnesium burns in the same gas, separating
carbon from it. Speaking generally, combined oxygen can pass from
one compound to another.</p>

<p>The products of combustion or oxidation&mdash;and in general the definite
compounds of oxygen&mdash;are termed <i>oxides</i>. Some oxides are not capable
of combining with other oxides&mdash;or combine with only a few, and then
with the evolution of very little heat; others, on the contrary, enter
into combination with very many other oxides, and in general have
remarkable chemical energy. The oxides incapable of combining with
others, or only showing this quality in a small degree, are termed
<i>indifferent oxides</i>. Such are the peroxides, of which mention has before
been made.</p>

<p>The class of oxides capable of entering into mutual combination
we will term <i>saline oxides</i>. They fall into two chief groups&mdash;at least,
as regards the most extreme members. The members of one group
combine with the members of the other group with particular ease.
As representative of one group may be taken the oxides of the metals,
magnesium, sodium, calcium, &amp;c. Representatives of the other group
are the oxides formed by the non-metals, sulphur, phosphorus, carbon.
Thus, if we take the oxide of calcium, or lime, and bring it into
contact with oxides of the second group, combination very readily
ensues. For instance, if we mix calcium oxide with oxide of phosphorus
they combine with great facility and with the evolution of
much heat. If we pass the vapour of sulphuric anhydride, obtained
by the combination of sulphurous oxide with oxygen, over pieces of
lime heated to redness, the sulphuric anhydride is absorbed by the
lime with the formation of a substance called calcium sulphate. The
oxides of the first kind, which contain metals, are termed <i>basic oxides</i>
or <i>bases</i>. Lime is a familiar example of this class. The oxides of the
second group, which are capable of combining with the bases, are
termed <i>anhydrides of the acids</i> or <i>acid oxides</i>. Sulphuric anhydride,
SO<sub>3</sub>, may be taken as a type of the latter group. It is a compound
of sulphur with oxygen formed not directly but by the addition of
a fresh quantity of oxygen to sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, by passing
it together with oxygen over incandescent spongy platinum. Carbonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
anhydride (often termed &lsquo;carbonic acid&rsquo;), CO<sub>2</sub>, phosphoric anhydride,
sulphurous anhydride, are all acid oxides, for they can combine with
such oxides as lime or calcium oxide, magnesia or magnesium oxide,
MgO, soda or sodium oxide, Na<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If a given element form but one basic oxide, it is termed the <i>oxide</i>;
for example, calcium oxide, magnesium oxide, potassium oxide. Some
indifferent oxides are also called &lsquo;oxides&rsquo; if they have not the properties
of peroxides, and at the same time do not show the properties of acid
anhydrides&mdash;for example, carbonic oxide, of which mention has already
been made. If an element forms two basic oxides (or two indifferent
oxides not having the characteristics of a peroxide) then that of the
lower degree of oxidation is called a <i>suboxide</i>&mdash;that is, suboxides contain
less oxygen than oxides. Thus, when copper is heated to redness in a
furnace it increases in weight and absorbs oxygen, until for 63 parts
of copper there is absorbed not more than 8 parts of oxygen by weight,
forming a red mass, which is suboxide of copper; but if the roasting
be prolonged, and the draught of air increased, 63 parts of copper
absorb 16 parts of oxygen, and form black oxide of copper. Sometimes
to distinguish between the degrees of oxidation a change of
suffix is made in the oxidised element, <i>-ic</i> oxide denoting the higher
degree of oxidation, and <i>-ous</i> oxide the lower degree. Thus ferrous
oxide and ferric oxide are the same as suboxide of iron and oxide of
iron. If an element forms one anhydride only, then it is named by an
adjective formed from the name of the element made to end in <i>-ic</i> and
the word <i>anhydride</i>. When an element forms two anhydrides, then
the suffixes <i>-ous</i> and <i>-ic</i> are used to distinguish them: <i>-ous</i> signifying
less oxygen than <i>-ic</i>; for example, sulphurous and sulphuric
anhydrides.<a name="FNanchor_49_225" id="FNanchor_49_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_225" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> When several oxides are formed from the same element,
the prefixes <i>mon</i>, <i>di</i>, <i>tri</i>, <i>tetra</i> are used, thus: chlorine monoxide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
chlorine dioxide, chlorine trioxide, and chlorine tetroxide or chloric
anhydride.</p>

<p>The oxides themselves rarely undergo chemical transformations, and
in the few cases where they are subject to such changes a particularly
important part is played by their combinations with water. The
majority of, if not all, basic and acid oxides combine with water, either
by a direct or an indirect method forming <i>hydrates</i>&mdash;that is, compounds
which split up into water and an oxide of the same kind only. It
is well known that many substances are capable of combining with
water. Oxides possess this property in the highest degree. We have
already seen examples of this (Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.) in the combination of lime,
and of sulphuric and phosphoric anhydrides, with water. The resulting
combinations are basic and acid hydrates. Acid hydrates are called
<i>acids</i> because they have an acid taste when dissolved in water (or
saliva), for then only can they act on the palate. Vinegar, for example,
has an acid taste because it contains acetic acid dissolved in water.
Sulphuric acid, to which we have frequently referred, because it
is the acid of the greatest importance both in practical chemistry and
for its technical applications, is really a hydrate formed by the combination
of sulphuric anhydride with water. Besides their acid taste,
dissolved acids or acid hydrates have the property of changing the blue
colour of certain vegetable dyes to red. Of these dyes <i>litmus</i> is
particularly remarkable and much used. It is the blue substance extracted
from certain lichens, and is used for dyeing tissues blue; it
gives a blue infusion with water. This infusion, on the addition of an
acid, <i>changes from blue to red</i>.<a name="FNanchor_50_226" id="FNanchor_50_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_226" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Basic oxides, in combining with water, form hydrates, of which,
however, very few are soluble in water. Those which are soluble in
water have an alkaline taste like that of soap or of water in which
wood ashes have been boiled, and are called <i>alkalis</i>. Further, alkalis
have the property of restoring the blue colour to litmus which has been
reddened by the action of acids. The hydrates of the oxides of sodium
and potassium, NaHO and KHO, are examples of basic hydrates
easily soluble in water. They are true alkalis, and are termed <i>caustic</i>,
because they act very powerfully on the skin of animals and plants.
Thus NaHO is called &lsquo;caustic&rsquo; soda.</p>

<p>The saline oxides are capable of combining together and with
water. Water itself is an oxide, and not an indifferent one, for it can,
as we have seen, combine with basic and acid oxides; it is a representative
of a whole series of saline oxides, <i>intermediate oxides</i>, capable of
combining with both basic and acid oxides. There are many such
oxides, which, like water, combine with basic and acid anhydrides&mdash;for
instance, the oxides of aluminium and tin, &amp;c. From this it may be
concluded that all oxides might be placed, in respect to their capacity
for combining with one another, in one uninterrupted series, at one
extremity of which would stand those oxides which do not combine
with the bases&mdash;that is, the alkalis&mdash;while at the other end would be
the acid oxides, and in the interval those oxides which combine with
one another and with both the acid and basic oxides. The further
apart the members of this series are, the more stable are the compounds
they form together, the more energetically do they act on each other,
the greater the quantity of heat evolved in their reaction, and the
more marked is their saline chemical character.</p>

<p>We said above that basic and acid oxides combine together, but
rarely react on each other; this depends on the fact that the majority
of them are solids or gases&mdash;that is, they occur in the state least prone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to chemical reaction. The gaseo-elastic state is with difficulty destroyed,
because it necessitates overcoming the elasticity proper to the gaseous
particles. The solid state is characterised by the immobility of its
particles; whilst chemical action requires contact, and hence a displacement
and mobility. If solid oxides be heated, and especially if
they be melted, then reaction proceeds with great ease. But such a
change of state rarely occurs in nature or in practice. Only in a few
furnace processes is this the case. For example; in the manufacture of
glass, the oxides contained in it combine together in a molten state.
But when oxides combine with water, and especially when they form
hydrates soluble in water, then the mobility of their particles increases
to a considerable extent, and their reaction is greatly facilitated. Reaction
then takes place at the ordinary temperature&mdash;easily and rapidly;
so that this kind of reaction belongs to the class of those which take
place with unusual facility, and are, therefore, very often taken advantage
of in practice, and also have been and are going on in nature at
every step. We will now consider the reactions of oxides in the state
of hydrates, not losing sight of the fact that water is itself an oxide
with definite properties, and has, therefore, no little influence on the
course of those changes in which it takes part.</p>

<p>If we take a definite quantity of an acid, and add an infusion of
litmus to it, it turns red; the addition of an alkaline solution does not
immediately alter the red colour of the litmus, but on adding more and
more of the alkaline solution a point is reached when the red colour
changes to violet, and then the further addition of a fresh quantity of
the alkaline solution changes the colour to blue. This change of the
colour of the litmus is a consequence of the formation of a new compound.
This reaction is termed the <i>saturation</i> or <i>neutralisation</i> of
the acid by the base, or <i>vice versâ</i>. The solution in which the acid
properties of the acid are saturated by the alkaline properties of the
base is termed a <i>neutral</i> solution. Such a solution, although derived
from the mixture of a base with an acid, does not exhibit either
the acid or basic reaction on litmus, yet it preserves many other
signs of the acid and alkali. It is observed that in such a definite
admixture of an acid with an alkali, besides the changes in the colour
of litmus there is a heating effect&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> an evolution of heat&mdash;which is
alone sufficient to prove that there was chemical action. And, indeed,
if the resultant violet solution be evaporated, there separates out, not
the acid or the alkali originally taken, but a substance which has
neither acid nor alkaline properties, but is usually solid and crystalline,
having a saline appearance; this is a <i>salt</i> in the chemical sense of
the word. Hence a salt is derived from the reaction of an acid on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
an alkali, in a certain definite proportion. The water here taken for
solution plays no other part than merely facilitating the progress of
the reaction. This is seen from the fact that the anhydrides of the
acids are able to combine with basic oxides, and give the same salts as
do the acids with the alkalis or hydrates. Hence, a salt is a compound
of definite quantities of an acid with an alkali. In the latter reaction,
water is separated out if the substance formed be the same as is produced
by the combination of anhydrous oxides together.<a name="FNanchor_51_227" id="FNanchor_51_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_227" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Examples
of the formation of salts from acids and bases are easily observed, and
are very often applied in practice. If we take, for instance, insoluble
magnesium oxide (magnesia) it is easily dissolved in sulphuric acid, and
on evaporation gives a saline substance, bitter, like all the salts of magnesium,
and familiar to all under the name of Epsom salts, used as a
purgative. If a solution of caustic soda&mdash;which is obtained, as we saw,
by the action of water on sodium oxide&mdash;be poured into a flask in which
charcoal has been burnt; or if carbonic anhydride, which is produced
under so many circumstances, be passed through a solution of caustic
soda, then sodium carbonate or soda, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is obtained, of which we
have spoken several times, and which is prepared on a large scale and
often used in manufactures. This reaction is expressed by the equation,
2NaHO + CO<sub>2</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. Thus, the various bases and acids
form an innumerable number of different salts.<a name="FNanchor_52_228" id="FNanchor_52_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_228" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> Salts constitute an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
example of definite chemical compounds, and both in the history and
practice of science are most often cited as confirming the conception of
definite chemical compounds. Indeed, all the indications of a definite
chemical combination are clearly seen in the formation and properties
of salts. Thus, they are produced with a definite proportion of oxides,
heat is evolved in their formation,<a name="FNanchor_53_229" id="FNanchor_53_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_229" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and the chemical character of the
oxides and many of the physical properties become hidden in their salts.
For example, when gaseous carbonic anhydride combines with a base<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
to form a solid salt, the elasticity of the gas quite disappears in its
passage into the salt.<a name="FNanchor_54_230" id="FNanchor_54_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_230" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Judging from the above, a salt is a compound of basic and
acid oxides, or the result of the action of hydrates of these classes on
each other with separation of water. But salts may be obtained by
other methods. It must not be forgotten that basic oxides are formed
by metals, and acid oxides usually by non-metals. But metals and
non-metals are capable of combining together, and a salt is frequently
formed by the oxidation of such a compound. For example, iron very
easily combines with sulphur, forming iron sulphide FeS (as we saw
in the Introduction); this in air, and especially moist air, absorbs
oxygen, with the formation of the same salt FeSO<sub>4</sub>, that may be obtained
by the combination of the oxides of iron and sulphur, or of the hydrates
of these oxides. Hence, it cannot be said or supposed that a salt has
the properties of the oxides, or must necessarily contain two kinds
of oxides in itself. The derivation of salts from oxides is merely one
of the methods of their preparation. We saw, for instance, that in
sulphuric acid it was possible to replace the hydrogen by zinc, and that
by this means zinc sulphate was formed; so likewise the hydrogen
in many other acids may be replaced by zinc, iron, potassium, sodium,
and a whole series of similar metals, corresponding salts being
obtained. The hydrogen of the acid, in all these cases, is exchanged
for a metal, and a salt is obtained from the hydrate. Regarding a
salt from this point of view, it may be said that <i>a salt is an acid in
which hydrogen is replaced by a metal</i>. This definition shows that a
salt and an acid are essentially compounds of the same series, with the
difference that the latter contains hydrogen and the former a metal.
Such a definition is more exact than the first definition of salts,
inasmuch as it likewise includes those acids which do not contain
oxygen, and, as we shall afterwards learn, there is a series of such acids.
Such elements as chlorine and bromine form compounds with hydrogen
in which the hydrogen may be replaced by a metal, forming substances
which, in their reactions and external characters, resemble the salts
formed from oxides. Table salt, NaCl, is an example of this. It may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
be obtained by the replacement of hydrogen in hydrochloric acid, HCl,
by the metal sodium, just as sulphate of sodium, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, may be
obtained by the replacement of hydrogen in sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, by
sodium. The exterior appearance of the resulting products, their
neutral reaction, and even their saline taste, show their resemblance
to one another.</p>

<p>To the fundamental properties of salts yet another must be added&mdash;namely,
that they are more or less <i>decomposed by the action of a galvanic
current</i>. The results of this decomposition are very different according
to whether the salt be taken in a fused or dissolved state. But the decomposition
may generally be so represented, that the metal appears at the
electro-negative pole or cathode (like hydrogen in the decomposition of
water, or its mixture with sulphuric acid), and the remaining parts of
the salt appear at the electro-positive pole or anode (where the oxygen of
water appears). If, for instance, an electric current acts on an aqueous
solution of sodium sulphate, then the sodium appears at the negative
pole, and oxygen and the anhydride of sulphuric acid at the positive
pole. But in the solution itself the result is different, for sodium, as
we know, decomposes water with evolution of hydrogen, forming
caustic soda; consequently hydrogen will be evolved, and caustic soda
appear at the negative pole: while at the positive pole the sulphuric
anhydride immediately combines with water and forms sulphuric acid,
and therefore oxygen will be evolved and sulphuric acid formed round
this pole.<a name="FNanchor_55_231" id="FNanchor_55_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_231" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> In other cases, when the metal separated is not able to
decompose water, it will be deposited in a free state. Thus, for example,
in the decomposition of copper sulphate, copper separates out at the
cathode, and oxygen and sulphuric acid appear at the anode, and if a
copper plate be attached to the positive pole, then the oxygen evolved
will oxidise the copper, and the oxide of copper will dissolve and be
deposited at the negative pole&mdash;that is, a transfer of copper from the
positive to the negative pole ensues. The galvanoplastic art (electro-typing)
is based on this principle.<a name="FNanchor_56_232" id="FNanchor_56_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_232" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Therefore the most radical and
general properties of salts (including also such salts as table salt, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
contain no oxygen) may be expressed by representing the salt as
composed of a metal M and a haloid X&mdash;that is, by expressing the salt
by MX. In common table salt the metal is sodium, and the haloid an
elementary body, chlorine. In sodium sulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, sodium is
again the metal, but the complex group, SO<sub>4</sub>, is the haloid. In sulphate
of copper, CuSO<sub>4</sub>, the metal is copper and the haloid the same as in
the preceding salt. Such a representation of salts expresses with great
simplicity the <i>capacity of every salt to enter into saline double decompositions
with other salts</i>; consisting in the mutual replacement of the
metals in the salts. This exchange of their metals is the fundamental
property of salts. In the case of two salts with different metals
and haloids, which are in solution or fusion, or in any other manner
brought into contact, the metals of these salts will always partially
or wholly exchange places. If we designate one salt by MX, and the
other by NY, then we either partially or wholly obtain from them new
salts, MY and NX. Thus we saw in the Introduction, that on mixing
solutions of table salt, NaCl, and silver nitrate, AgNO<sub>3</sub>, a white
insoluble precipitate of silver chloride, AgCl, is formed and a new salt,
sodium nitrate, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, is obtained in solution. If the metals of salts
exchange places in reactions of double decomposition, it is clear that
metals themselves, taken in a separate state, are able to act on salts, as
zinc evolves hydrogen from acids, and as iron separates copper from
copper sulphate. When, to what extent, and which metals displace
each other, and how the metals are distributed between the haloids,
will be discussed in Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>., where we shall be guided by those
reflections and deductions which Berthollet introduced into the science
at the beginning of this century.</p>

<p>According to the above observations, an acid is nothing more than
a salt of hydrogen. Water itself may be looked on as a salt in which
the hydrogen is combined with either oxygen or the aqueous radicle,
OH; water will then be HOH, and alkalis or basic hydrates, MOH.
The group OH, or the <i>aqueous radicle</i>, otherwise called <i>hydroxyl</i>, may
be looked on as a haloid like the chlorine in table salt, not only because
the element Cl and the group OH very often change places, and combine
with one and the same element, but also because free chlorine is
very similar in many properties and reactions to peroxide of hydrogen,
which is the same in composition as the aqueous radicle, as we shall
afterwards see in Chapter <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>. Alkalis and basic hydrates are also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
salts consisting of a metal and hydroxyl&mdash;for instance, caustic soda,
NaOH; this is therefore termed <i>sodium hydroxide</i>. According to this
view, <i>acid salts</i> are those in which a portion only of the hydrogen is
replaced by a metal, and a portion of the hydrogen of the acid remains.
Thus sulphuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) not only gives the normal salt Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
with sodium, but also an acid salt, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>. A <i>basic salt</i> is one in
which the metal is combined not only with the haloids of acids, but
also with the aqueous radicale of basic hydrates&mdash;for example, bismuth
gives not only a normal salt of nitric acid, Bi(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, but also basic
salts like Bi(OH)<sub>2</sub>(NO<sub>3</sub>).</p>

<p>As basic and acid salts of the oxygen acids contain hydrogen and
oxygen, they are able to part with these as water and to give anhydro-salts,
which it is evident will be compounds of normal salts with
anhydrides of the acids or with bases. Thus the above-mentioned acid
sodium sulphate corresponds with the anhydro-salt, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, equal to
2NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, less H<sub>2</sub>O. The loss of water is here, and frequently in
other cases, brought about by heat alone, and therefore such salts are
frequently termed <i>pyro-salts</i>&mdash;for instance, the preceding is sodium
pyrosulphate (Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), or it may be regarded as the normal salt
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>. <i>Double</i> salts are those which
contain either two metals, KAl(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, or two haloids.<a name="FNanchor_57_233" id="FNanchor_57_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_233" class="fnanchor">[57]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Inasmuch as oxygen compounds predominate in nature, it should be
expected from what has been said above, that salts, rather than acids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
or bases, would occur most frequently in nature, for these latter would
always tend to combine forming salts, especially through the medium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
of the all-pervading water. And, as a matter of fact, salts are found
everywhere in nature. They occur in animals and plants, although in but
small quantity, because, as forming the last stage of chemical reaction,
they are capable of only a few chemical transformations. And organisms
are bodies in which a series of uninterrupted, varied, and active
chemical transformations proceed, whilst salts, which only enter into
double decompositions between each other, are little prone to such
changes. But organisms always contain salts. Thus, for instance,
bones contain calcium phosphate, the juice of grapes potassium tartrate
(cream of tartar), certain lichens calcium oxalate, and the shells of
mollusca calcium carbonate, &amp;c. As regards water and soil, portions
of the earth in which the chemical processes are less active, they are
full of salts. Thus the waters of the oceans, and all others (Chap. <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.),
abound in salts, and in the soil, in the rocks of the earth's crust, in the
upheaved lavas, and in the falling meteorites the salts of silicic acid,
and especially its double salts, predominate. Saline substances also
make up the composition of those limestones which often form mountain
chains and whole thicknesses of the earth's strata, these consisting of
calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Thus we have seen oxygen in a free state and in various compounds
of different degrees of stability, from the unstable salts, like Berthollet's
salt and nitre, to the most stable silicon compounds, such as exist
in granite. We saw an entirely similar gradation of stability in the
compounds of water and of hydrogen. In all its aspects oxygen, as an
element, or single substance, remains the same however varied its
chemical states, just as a substance may appear in many different
physical states of aggregation. But our notion of the immense variety
of the chemical states in which oxygen can occur would not be completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
understood if we did not make ourselves acquainted with it in
the form in which it occurs in ozone and peroxide of hydrogen. In these
it is most active, its energy seems to have increased. They illustrate
fresh aspects of chemical correlations, and the variety of the forms in
which matter can appear stand out clearly. We will therefore consider
these two substances somewhat in detail.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_175" id="Footnote_2_175"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_175"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> It is evident that the partial pressure (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.) acts in respiration. The
researches of Paul Bert showed this with particular clearness. Under a pressure of one-fifth
of an atmosphere consisting of oxygen only, animals and human beings remain
under the ordinary conditions of the partial pressure of oxygen, but organisms cannot
support air rarefied to one-fifth, for then the partial pressure of the oxygen falls to one-twenty-fifth
of an atmosphere. Even under a pressure of one-third of an atmosphere the
regular life of human beings is impossible, by reason of the impossibility of respiration
(because of the decrease of solubility of oxygen in the blood), owing to the small partial
pressure of the oxygen, and not from any mechanical effect of the decrease of pressure.
Paul Bert illustrated all this by many experiments, some of which he conducted on himself.
This explains, among other things, the discomfort felt in the ascent of high mountains
or in balloons when the height reached exceeds eight kilometres, and at pressures
below 250 mm. (Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_23_147">23</a>). It is evident that an artificial atmosphere has
to be employed in the ascent to great heights, just as in submarine work. The cure by
compressed and rarefied air which is practised in certain illnesses is based partly on
the mechanical action of the change of pressure, and partly on the alteration in the partial
pressure of the respired oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_176" id="Footnote_3_176"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_176"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> At night, without the action of light, without the absorption of that energy which is
required for the decomposition of carbonic anhydride into free oxygen and carbon (which
is retained by the plants) they breathe like animals, absorbing oxygen and evolving
carbonic anhydride. This process also goes on side by side with the reverse process in
the daytime, but it is then far feebler than that which gives oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_177" id="Footnote_4_177"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_177"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The earth's surface is equal to about 510 million square kilometres, and the mass of
the air (at a pressure of 760 mm.) on each kilometre of surface is about 10&#8531; thousand
millions of kilograms, or about 10&#8531; million tons; therefore the whole weight of the atmosphere
is about 5,100 million million (= 51 × 10<sup>14</sup>) tons. Consequently there are about
2 × 10<sup>15</sup> tons of free oxygen in the earth's atmosphere. The innumerable series of processes
which absorb a portion of this oxygen are compensated for by the plant processes.
Assuming that 100 million tons of vegetable matter, containing 40 p.c. of carbon, formed
from carbonic acid, are produced (and the same process proceeds in water) per year on
the 100 million square kilometres of dry land (ten tons of roots, leaves, stems, &amp;c., per
hectare, or

of a square kilometre), we find that the plant life of the dry land gives
about 100,000 tons of oxygen, which is an insignificant fraction of the entire mass of the
oxygen of the air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_178" id="Footnote_5_178"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_178"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The extraction of oxygen from water may be effected by two processes: either by
the decomposition of water into its constituent parts by the action of a galvanic current
(Chapter <a href="#Page_113">II</a>.), or by means of the removal of the hydrogen from water. But, as we have
seen and already know, hydrogen enters into direct combination with very few substances,
and then only under special circumstances; whilst oxygen, as we shall soon learn, combines
with nearly all substances. Only gaseous chlorine (and, especially, fluorine) is
capable of decomposing water, taking up the hydrogen from it, without combining with
the oxygen. Chlorine is soluble in water, and if an aqueous solution of chlorine, so-called
chlorine water, be poured into a flask, and this flask be inverted in a basin containing
the same chlorine water, then we shall have an apparatus by means of which oxygen may be
extracted from water. At the ordinary temperature, and in the dark, chlorine does not
act on water, or only acts very feebly; but under the action of direct sunlight chlorine
decomposes water, with the evolution of oxygen. The chlorine then combines with the
hydrogen, and gives hydrochloric acid, which dissolves in the water, and therefore free
oxygen only will be separated from the liquid, and it will only contain a small quantity
of chlorine in admixture, which can be easily removed by passing the gas through a
solution of caustic potash.</p></div>

<p class="caption" style="width: 275px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 27.&mdash;Graham's apparatus for the decomposition of air
by pumping it through india-rubber.</p></div>

<p>A difference in the physical properties of both gases cannot be here taken advantage
of, because they are very similar in this respect. Thus the density of oxygen is 16 times
and of nitrogen 14 times greater than the density of hydrogen, and therefore porous
vessels cannot be here employed&mdash;the difference between the times of their passage
through a porous surface would be too insignificant.</p>

<p>Graham, however, succeeded in enriching air in oxygen by passing it through india-rubber.
This may be done in the following way:&mdash;A common india-rubber cushion, <span class="smcap">E</span>
(Fig. <a href="#fig_27">27</a>), is taken, and its orifice hermetically connected with an air-pump, or, better
still, a mercury aspirator (the Sprengel pump is designated by the letters <span class="smcap">A</span>, <span class="smcap">C</span>, <span class="smcap">B</span>). When
the aspirator (Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_16_140">16</a>) has pumped out the air, which will be seen by the
mercury running out in an almost uninterrupted stream, and from its standing approximately
at the barometric height, then it may be clearly observed that gas passes through the
india-rubber. This is also seen
from the fact that bubbles of gas
continually pass along with the
mercury. A minus pressure may
be constantly maintained in the
cushion by pouring mercury
into the funnel <span class="smcap">A</span>, and screwing
up the pinchcock <span class="smcap">C</span>, so that the
stream flowing from it is small,
and then a portion of the air
passing through the india-rubber
will be carried along
with the mercury. This air
may be collected in the cylinder,
<span class="smcap">R</span>. Its composition proves
to be about 42 volumes of
oxygen with 57 volumes of nitrogen,
and one volume of carbonic
anhydride, whilst ordinary
air contains only 21 volumes
of oxygen in 100 volumes. A
square metre of india-rubber
surface (of the usual thickness)
passes about 45 c.c. of such air
per hour. This experiment
clearly shows that india-rubber
is permeable to gases. This
may, by the way, be observed
in common toy balloons filled
with coal-gas. They fall after
a day or two, not because there
are holes in them, but because
air penetrates into, and the gas
from, their interior, through the
surface of the india-rubber of
which they are made. The
rate of the passage of gases
through india-rubber does not,
as Mitchell and Graham showed,
depend on their densities, and
consequently its permeability
is not determined by orifices. It more resembles dialysis&mdash;that is, the penetration
of liquids through colloid surfaces. Equal volumes of gases penetrate through india-rubber
in periods of time which are related to each other as follows:&mdash;carbonic anhydride,
100; hydrogen, 247; oxygen, 532; marsh gas, 633; carbonic oxide, 1,220; nitrogen, 1,358.
Hence nitrogen penetrates more slowly than oxygen, and carbonic anhydride more
quickly than other gases. 2·556 volumes of oxygen and 13·585 volumes of carbonic
anhydride penetrate in the same time as one volume of nitrogen. By multiplying these
ratios by the amounts of these gases in air, we obtain figures which are in almost the
same proportion as the volumes of the gases penetrating from air through india-rubber.
If the process of dialysis be repeated on the air which has already passed through india-rubber,
then a mixture containing 65 p.c. by volume of oxygen is obtained. It may be
thought that the cause of this phenomenon is the absorption or occlusion (<i>see</i> Chap. II.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_37_161">37</a>) of gases by india-rubber and the evolution of the gas dissolved in a vacuum; and,
indeed, india-rubber does absorb gases, especially carbonic anhydride. Graham called the
above method of the decomposition of air <i>atmolysis</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_180" id="Footnote_7_180"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_180"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> The preparation of oxygen by this method, which is due to Boussingault, is conducted
in a porcelain tube, which is placed in a stove heated by charcoal, so that its ends project
beyond the stove. Barium oxide (which may be obtained by igniting barium nitrate,
previously dried) is placed in the tube, one end of which is connected with a pair of
bellows, or a gas-holder, for keeping up a current of air through it. The air is previously
passed through a solution of caustic potash, to remove all traces of carbonic anhydride,
and it is very carefully dried (for the hydrate BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> does not give the peroxide). At a
<i>dark-red heat</i> (500&ndash;600°) the oxide of barium absorbs oxygen from the air, so that the gas
leaving the tube consists almost entirely of nitrogen. When the absorption ceases, the air
will pass through the tube unchanged, which may be recognised from the fact that it supports
combustion. The barium oxide is converted into peroxide under these circumstances,
and eleven parts of barium oxide absorb about one part of oxygen by weight. When the
absorption ceases, one end of the tube is closed, a cork with a gas-conducting tube is fixed
into the other end, and the heat of the stove is increased to a <i>bright-red heat</i> (800°). At
this temperature the barium peroxide gives up all that oxygen which it acquired at a dark-red
heat&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> about one part by weight of oxygen is evolved from twelve parts of barium
peroxide. After the evolution of the oxygen there remains the barium oxide which was
originally taken, so that air may be again passed over it, and thus the preparation of oxygen
from one and the same quantity of barium oxide may be repeated many times. Oxygen
has been produced one hundred times from one mass of oxide by this method; all the necessary
precautions being taken, as regards the temperature of the mass and the removal
of moisture and carbonic acid from the air. Unless these precautions be taken, the mass
of oxide soon spoils.</p>

<p>As oxygen may become of considerable technical use, from its capacity for giving
high temperatures and intense light in the combustion of substances, its preparation
directly from air by practical methods forms a problem whose solution many investigators
continue to work at up to the present day. The most practical methods are those
of Tessié du Motay and Kassner. The first is based on the fact that a mixture of equal
weights of manganese peroxide and caustic soda at an incipient red heat (about 350°)
absorbs oxygen from air, with the separation of water, according to the equation MnO<sub>2</sub> +
2NaHO + O = Na<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. If superheated steam, at a temperature of about 450°,
be then passed through the mixture, the manganese peroxide and caustic soda originally
taken are regenerated, and the oxygen held by them is evolved, according to the reverse
equation Na<sub>2</sub>MnO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = MnO<sub>2</sub> + 2NaHO + O. This mode of preparing oxygen may be
repeated for an infinite number of times. The oxygen in combining liberates water, and
steam, acting on the resultant substance, evolves oxygen. Hence all that is required for
the preparation of oxygen by this method is fuel and the alternate cutting off the supply
of air and steam. In Kassner's process (1891) a mixture of oxide of lead and lime (PbO +
2CaO) is heated to redness in the presence of air, oxygen is then absorbed and calcium
plumbate, Ca<sub>2</sub>PbO<sub>4</sub>, formed. The latter is of a chocolate colour, and on further heating
evolves oxygen and gives the original mixture PbO + 2CaO&mdash;that is, the phenomenon is
essentially the same as in Boussingault's process (with BaO), but according to Le Chatelier
(1893) the dissociation tension of the oxygen evolved from Ca<sub>2</sub>PbO<sub>4</sub> is less than with
BaO<sub>2</sub> at equal temperatures; for instance, at 940°, 112 mm. of mercury for the first, and
for the latter 210 mm. at 720°, and 670 mm. at 790°, while for Ca<sub>2</sub>PbO<sub>4</sub> this tension is only
reached at 1,080°. However, in Kassner's process the oxygen is absorbed more rapidly,
and the influence of the presence of moisture and CO<sub>2</sub> in the air is not so marked, so that
this process, like that of Tessié du Motay, deserves consideration.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_181" id="Footnote_8_181"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_181"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Even the decomposition of manganese peroxide is reversible, and it may be re-obtained
from that suboxide (or its salts), which is formed in the evolution of oxygen
(Chap. XI., Note <a href="#Footnote_6_627">6</a>). The compounds of chromic acid containing the trioxide CrO<sub>3</sub> in

of the solutions of many substances in a higher degree of oxidation. In this respect we
may mention that Kassner (1890) proposes to obtain oxygen for laboratory purposes by
mixing BaO<sub>2</sub> with FeK<sub>3</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub> (red prussiate of potash, Chapter XXII.): the reaction
proceeds with the evolution of oxygen even on the addition of a very small quantity of
water. In order to ensure a gradual evolution of gas the author proposes to introduce
both substances into the reaction, little by little, instead of all at once, which may be
done with the following arrangement (Gavaloffsky): finely powdered peroxide of barium
is placed in an ordinary flask and sufficient water is added to fill the flask one-third
full. The cork closing the flask has three holes; (1) for the gas-conducting tube; (2) for
a rod to stir the BaO<sub>2</sub>; and (3) for a glass rod terminating in a perforated glass vessel
containing crystals of FeK<sub>3</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub>. When it is desired to start the evolution of the
oxygen, the vessel is lowered until it is immersed in the liquid in the flask, and the BaO<sub>2</sub>
is stirred with the other rod. The reaction proceeds according to the equation, BaO<sub>2</sub> +
2FeK<sub>3</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub> = FeK<sub>4</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub> + FeK<sub>2</sub>Ba(CN)<sub>6</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>. The double salt, FeBa<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub>, crystallises
out from the mother liquor. To understand the course of the reaction, it must be remembered
BaO<sub>2</sub> is of a higher degree of oxidation, and that it parts with oxygen and gives the
base BaO which enters into the complex salt FeK<sub>2</sub>Ba(CN)<sub>6</sub> = Fe(CN)<sub>2</sub> + 2KCN + Ba(CN)<sub>2</sub>,
and this latter = BaO + 2HCN - H<sub>2</sub>O. Moreover, FeK<sub>3</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub> contains the salt Fe<sub>2</sub>(CN)<sub>6</sub>
which also corresponds to the higher degree of oxidation of iron, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, whilst after the
reaction a salt is obtained which contains Fe(CN)<sub>2</sub>, and corresponds to the lower degree of
oxidation, FeO, so that (in the presence of water) oxygen is also set free on this side also,
<i>i.e.</i> the reaction gives lower degrees of oxidation and oxygen.</p></div>

calorimeter either alone or with a definite quantity of potassium chlorate mixed with

Chlorine and Potassium). It is to be remarked that potassium chloride melts at 766°,
potassium chlorate at 359°, and potassium perchlorate at 610°. (Concerning the decomposition

as they might cause an explosion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_188" id="Footnote_14_188"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_188"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The decomposition of a mixture of fused and well-crushed potassium chlorate with
powdered manganese peroxide proceeds at so low a temperature (the salt does not melt)
that it may be effected in an ordinary glass flask. The apparatus is arranged in the
same manner as in the decomposition of mercury oxide (Introduction), or as shown in
the last drawing. As the reaction is exothermal, the decomposition of potassium
chlorate with the formation of oxygen may probably be accomplished, under certain
conditions (for example, under contact action), at very low temperatures. Substances
mixed with the potassium chlorate probably act partially in this manner.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_189" id="Footnote_15_189"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_189"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Many other salts evolve oxygen by heat, like potassium chlorate, but they only
part with it either at a very high temperature (for instance, common nitre) or else
are unsuited for use on account of their cost (potassium manganate), or evolve impure
oxygen at a high temperature (zinc sulphate at a red heat gives a mixture of
sulphurous anhydride and oxygen), and are not therefore used in practice.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_190" id="Footnote_16_190"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_190"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Such is, at present, the only possible method of explaining the phenomenon of
contact action. In many cases, such as the present one, it is supported by observations
based on facts. Thus, for instance, it is known, as regards oxygen, that often two substances
rich in oxygen retain it so long as they are separate, but directly they come into
contact free oxygen is evolved from both of them. Thus, an aqueous solution of hydrogen
peroxide (containing twice as much oxygen as water) acts in this manner on silver
oxide (containing silver and oxygen). This reaction takes place at the ordinary temperature,
and the oxygen is evolved from both compounds. To this class of phenomena may
be also referred the fact that a mixture of barium peroxide and potassium manganate
with water and sulphuric acid evolves oxygen at the ordinary temperature (Note <a href="#Footnote_9_BIS_183">9</a>).
It would seem that the essence of phenomena of this kind is entirely and purely a
property of contact; the distribution of the atoms is changed by contact, and if the
equilibrium be unstable it is destroyed. This is more especially evident in the case
of those substances which change exothermally&mdash;that is, for those reactions which are
accompanied by an evolution of heat. The decomposition CaCl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = CaCl<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> belongs
to this class (like the decomposition of potassium chlorate).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_191" id="Footnote_17_191"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_191"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Generally a solution of bleaching powder is alkaline (contains free lime), and
therefore, a solution of cobalt chloride is added directly to it, by which means the oxide

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_192" id="Footnote_18_192"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_192"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> It must be remarked that in all the reactions above mentioned the formation of
oxygen may be prevented by the admixture of substances capable of combining with it&mdash;for
example, charcoal, many carbon (organic) compounds, sulphur, phosphorus, and
various lower oxidation products, &amp;c. These substances absorb the oxygen evolved,
combine with it, and a compound containing oxygen is formed. Thus, if a mixture of
potassium chlorate and charcoal be heated, no oxygen is obtained, but an explosion
takes place from the rapid formation of gases resulting from the combination of the
oxygen of the potassium chlorate with the charcoal and the evolution of gaseous CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The oxygen obtained by any of the above-described methods is rarely pure. It
generally contains aqueous vapour, carbonic anhydride, and very often small traces of
chlorine. The oxygen may be freed from these impurities by passing it through a solution
of caustic potash, and by drying it. If the potassium chlorate be dry and pure, it
gives almost pure oxygen. However, if the oxygen be required for respiration in cases
of sickness, it should be washed by passing it through a solution of caustic alkali and
through water. The best way to obtain pure oxygen directly is to take potassium
perchlorate (KClO<sub>4</sub>), which can be well purified and then evolves pure oxygen on
heating.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_195" id="Footnote_21_195"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_195"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> As water consists of 1 volume of oxygen and 2 volumes of hydrogen, and
contains 16 parts by weight of oxygen per 2 parts by weight of hydrogen, it therefore
follows directly that oxygen is 16 times denser than hydrogen. Conversely, the composition
of water by weight may be deduced from the densities of hydrogen and oxygen,
and the volumetric composition of water. This method of mutual and reciprocal correction
strengthens the practical data of the exact sciences, whose conclusions require the
greatest possible exactitude and variety of corrections.</p>

<p>It must he observed that the specific heat of oxygen at constant pressure is 0·2175,
consequently it is to the specific heat of hydrogen (3·409) as 1 is to 15·6. Hence, the
specific heats are inversely proportional to the weights of equal volumes. This signifies
that equal volumes of both gases have (nearly) equal specific heats&mdash;that is, they require
an equal quantity of heat for raising their temperature by 1°. We shall afterwards consider
the specific heat of different substances more fully in Chap. <a href="#Page_381">XIV</a>.</p>

<p>Oxygen, like the majority of difficultly-liquefiable gases, is but slightly soluble in
water and other liquids. The solubility is given in Note <a href="#Footnote_30_77">30</a>, Chap. I. From this it is
evident that water standing in air must absorb&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> dissolve&mdash;oxygen. This oxygen
serves for the respiration of fishes. Fishes cannot exist in boiled water, because it does
not contain the oxygen necessary for their respiration (<i>see</i> Chap. <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.)</p></div>

Similar sparks are formed in the combustion of iron, in other cases also. We saw the
combustion of iron filings in the Introduction. In the welding of iron small iron splinters
fly off in all directions and burn in the air, as is seen from the fact that whilst flying
through the air they remain red hot, and also because, on cooling, they are seen to be no
longer iron, but a compound of it with oxygen. The same thing takes place when the
hammer of a gun strikes against the flint. Small scales of steel are heated by the friction,
and glow and burn in the air. The combustion of iron is still better seen by taking
it as a very fine powder, such as is obtained by the decomposition of certain of its compounds&mdash;for
instance, by heating Prussian blue, or by the reduction of its compounds
with oxygen by hydrogen; when this fine powder is strewn in air, it burns by itself, even
without being previously heated (it forms a pyrophorus). This obviously depends on the
fact that the powder of iron presents a larger surface of contact with air than an equal

are passed through orifices, about 1&ndash;1&frac12; centimetre apart, in a cork. One tube is connected
with a gas-holder containing oxygen, and the other with a gas-holder full of
hydrogen. Having turned on the gases, the hydrogen is lighted, and a common lamp
glass, tapering towards the top, is placed over the cork. The hydrogen continues to burn
inside the lamp glass, at the expense of the oxygen. If the current of oxygen be then
decreased little by little, a point is reached when, owing to the insufficient supply of
oxygen, the flame of the hydrogen increases in size, disappears for several moments, and
then reappears at the tube supplying the oxygen. If the flow of oxygen be again increased,
the flame reappears at the hydrogen tube. Thus the flame may be made to
appear at one or the other tube at will, only the increase or decrease of the current of
gas must take place by degrees and not suddenly. Further, air may be taken instead of
oxygen, and ordinary coal-gas instead of hydrogen, and it will then be shown how air
burns in an atmosphere of coal-gas, and it can easily be proved that the lamp glass is
full of a gas combustible in air, because it may be lighted at the top.</p></div>

gases. A detailed account of <i>gas analysis</i> would be out of place in this work
(<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_30_205">30</a>), but, as an example, we will give a short description of the
determination of the composition of water by the eudiometer.</p>

<p>Pure and dry oxygen is first introduced into the eudiometer. When the
eudiometer and the gas in it acquire the temperature of the surrounding
atmosphere&mdash;which is recognised by the fact of the meniscus of the mercury
not altering its position during a long period of time&mdash;then the heights at
which the mercury stands in the eudiometer and in the bath are observed.
The difference (in millimetres) gives the height of the column of mercury in
the eudiometer. It must be reduced to the height at which the mercury
would stand at 0° and deducted from the atmospheric pressure, in order to
find the pressure under which the oxygen is measured (<i>see</i> Chap. I. Note <a href="#Footnote_29_153">29</a>).
The height of the mercury also shows the volume of the oxygen. The temperature
of the surrounding atmosphere and the height of the barometric
column must also be observed, in order to know the temperature of the
oxygen and the atmospheric pressure. When the volume of the oxygen has
been measured, pure and dry hydrogen is introduced into the eudiometer,
and the volume of the gases in the eudiometer again measured. They are
then exploded. This is done by a Leyden jar, whose outer coating is connected
by a chain with one wire, so that a spark passes when the other wire,
fused into the eudiometer, is touched by the terminal of the jar. Or else an
electrophorus is used, or, better still, a Ruhmkorff's coil, which has the
advantage of working equally well in damp or dry air, whilst a Leyden jar
or electrical machine does not act in damp weather. Further, it is necessary
to close the lower orifice of the eudiometer before the explosion (for this
purpose the eudiometer, which is fixed in a stand, is firmly pressed down
from above on to a piece of india-rubber placed at the bottom of the bath), as
otherwise the mercury and gas would be thrown out of the apparatus by the
explosion. It must also be remarked that to ensure complete combustion
the proportion between the volumes of oxygen and hydrogen must not exceed
twelve of hydrogen to one volume of oxygen, or fifteen volumes of
oxygen to one volume of hydrogen, because no explosion will take place if
one of the gases be in great excess. It is best to take a mixture of one volume of
hydrogen with several volumes of oxygen. The combustion will then be complete. It
is evident that water is formed, and that the volume (or tension) is diminished, so that
on opening the end of the eudiometer the mercury will rise in it. But the tension of the
aqueous vapour is now added to the tension of the gas remaining after the explosion.
This must be taken into account (Chap. I. Note <a href="#Footnote_1_47">1</a>). If but little gas remain, the water
which is formed will be sufficient for its saturation with aqueous vapour. This may be
learnt from the fact that drops of water are visible on the sides of the eudiometer after
the mercury has risen in it. If there be none, a certain quantity of water must be introduced
into the eudiometer. Then the number of millimetres expressing the pressure of
the vapour corresponding with the temperature of the experiment must be subtracted
from the atmospheric pressure at which the remaining gas is measured, otherwise the
result will be inaccurate (Chap. I. Note <a href="#Footnote_1_47">1</a>).</p>

<p>This is essentially the method of the determination of the composition of water which
was made for the first time by Gay-Lussac and Humboldt with sufficient accuracy.
Their determinations led them to the conclusion that water consists of two volumes of
hydrogen (more exactly 2·003, Le Duc 1892), and one volume of oxygen. Every time
they took a greater quantity of oxygen, the gas remaining after the explosion was oxygen.
When they took an excess of hydrogen, the remaining gas was hydrogen; and when the
oxygen and hydrogen were taken in exactly the above proportion, neither one nor the
other remained. The composition of water was thus definitely confirmed.</p></div>

be mentioned as illustrating the various uses of the eudiometer that Prof. Timeraseeff
employed microscopically small eudiometers to analyse the bubbles of gas given off from
the leaves of plants.</p></div>

passing to the surrounding space, then the combination of the oxygen and hydrogen does
not take place, even when the mixture is compressed by 150 times; for the gases are not
heated. If paper soaked with a solution of platinum (in aqua regia) and sal ammoniac
be burnt, then the ash obtained contains very finely-divided platinum, and in this form
it is best fitted for igniting hydrogen and detonating gas. Platinum wire requires to be
heated, but platinum in so finely divided a state as it occurs in this ash inflames hydrogen,
even at -20°. Many other metals, such as palladium (175°), iridium, and gold, act
with a slight rise of temperature, like platinum; but mercury, at its boiling point, does
not inflame detonating gas, although the slow formation of water then begins at
305°. All data of this kind show that the explosion of detonating gas presents one
of the many cases of contact phenomena. This conclusion is further confirmed by the
researches of V. Meyer (1892). He showed that only a very slow formation of steam
begins at 448°, and that it only proceeds more rapidly at 518°. The temperature of the
explosion of detonating gas, according to the same author, varies according as to whether
the explosion is produced in open vessels or in closed tubes. In the first case the temperature
of explosion lies between 530°&ndash;606°, and in the second between 630°&ndash;730°.
In general it may be remarked that the temperature of explosion of gaseous mixtures is
always lower in closed vessels than when the detonating mixture flows freely through
tubes. According to Freyer and V. Meyer, the following gases when mixed with the
requisite amount of oxygen explode at the following temperatures:</p>

<p>The velocity of the transmission of explosion in gaseous mixtures is as characteristic
a quantity for gaseous systems as the velocity of the transmission of sound. Berthelot
showed that this velocity depends neither upon the pressure nor upon the size of the
tubes in which the gaseous mixture is contained, nor upon the material out of which the
tube is made. Dixon (1891) determined the magnitude of these velocities for various
mixtures, and his results proved very near to those previously given by Berthelot. For
comparison we give the velocities expressed in metres per second:</p>

<p>The addition of oxygen to detonating gas lowers the velocity of the transmission of
explosion almost as much as the introduction of nitrogen. An excess of hydrogen on the
contrary raises the velocity of transmission. It is remarked that the explosion of mixtures
of oxygen with marsh gas, ethylene and cyanogen is transmitted more quickly if the
oxygen be taken in such a proportion that the carbon should burn to oxide of carbon, <i>i.e.</i>
the velocity of the explosion is less if the oxygen be taken in sufficient quantity to form
carbonic anhydride. Observations upon liquid and solid explosives (Berthelot) show that
in this case the velocity of transmission of explosion is dependent upon the material of
the tube. Thus the explosion of liquid nitro-methyl ether in glass tubes travels at the
rate (in dependence upon the diam., from 1 mm.&ndash;45 mm.) of from 1,890 to 2,482 metres,
and in tubes of Britannia metal (3 mm. in diam) at the rate of 1,230 metres. The harder
the tube the greater the velocity of transmission of explosion. The following are the
velocities for certain bodies:</p>

<p>In conclusion we may add that Mallard and Le Chatelier (1882) observed that in the
explosion of a mixture of 1 volume of detonating gas with <i>n</i> volumes of an inert gas, the
pressure is approximately equal to 9·2 - 0·9<i>n</i> atmospheres.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_211" id="Footnote_36_211"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_211"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> From the very commencement of the promulgation of the idea of dissociation, it
might have been imagined that reversible reactions of combination (the formation of H<sub>2</sub>
and O belongs to this number) commence at the same temperature as that at which
dissociation begins. And in many cases this is so, but not always, as may be seen from
the facts (1) that at 450&ndash;560°, when detonating gas explodes, the density of aqueous
vapour not only does not vary (and it hardly varies at higher temperatures, probably
because the amount of the products of dissociation is small), but there are not, as far as
is yet known, any traces of dissociation; (2) that under the influence of contact the temperature
at which combination takes place falls even to the ordinary temperature, when
water and similar compounds naturally are not dissociated and, judging from the data
communicated by D. P. Konovaloff (Introduction, Note 39) and others, it is impossible to
escape the phenomena of contact; all vessels, whether of metal or glass, show the same
influence as spongy platinum, although to a much less degree. The phenomena of
contact, judging from a review of the data referring to
it, must be especially sensitive in reactions which are
powerfully exothermal, and the explosion of detonating
gas is of this kind.</p></div>

<p class="caption" style="width: 275px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 33.&mdash;Favre and Silbermann's calorimeter
for determining the heat evolved in combustion.</p></div>

<p>The amount of heat evolved in the combustion of
a known weight (for instance, 1 gram) of a given substance
is determined by the rise in temperature of
water, to which the whole of the heat evolved in the
combustion is transmitted. A <i>calorimeter</i>, for example
that shown in fig. <a href="#fig_33">33</a>, is employed for this purpose. It
consists of a thin (in order that it may absorb less
heat), polished (that it should transmit a minimum of
heat) metallic vessel, surrounded by down (<i>c</i>), or some
other bad conductor of heat, and an outer metallic
vessel. This is necessary in order that the least
possible amount of heat should be lost from the
vessels; nevertheless, there is always a certain loss,
whose magnitude is determined by preliminary experiment
(by taking warm water, and determining its fall
in temperature after a definite period of time) as a
correction for the results of observations. The water
to which the heat of the burning substance is transmitted
is poured into the vessel. The stirrer <i>g</i> allows
of all the layers of water being brought to the same
temperature, and the thermometer serves for the determination of the temperature of the
water. The heat evolved passes, naturally, not to the water only, but to all the parts of
the apparatus. The quantity of water corresponding to the whole amount of those
objects (the vessels, tubes, &amp;c.) to which the heat is transmitted is previously determined,
and in this manner another most important correction is made in the calorimetric determinations.
The combustion itself is carried on in the vessel <i>a</i>. The ignited substance
is introduced through the tube at the top, which closes tightly. In fig. <a href="#fig_33">33</a> the apparatus
is arranged for the combustion of a gas, introduced by a tube. The oxygen required for
the combustion is led into <i>a</i> by the tube <i>e</i>, and the products of combustion either remain
in the vessel <i>a</i> (if liquid or solid), or escape by the tube <i>f</i> into an apparatus in which their
quantity and properties can easily be determined. Thus the heat evolved in combustion
passes to the walls of the vessel <i>a</i>, and to the gases which are formed in it, and these
transmit it to the water of the calorimeter.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_213" id="Footnote_38_213"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_213"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> This quantity of heat corresponds with the formation of liquid water at the ordinary
temperature from detonating gas at the same temperature. If the water be as vapour
the heat evolved = 58 major calories; if as ice = 70·4 major calories. A portion of this
heat is due to the fact that 2 vols. of hydrogen and 1 vol. of oxygen give 2 vols. of
aqueous vapour&mdash;that is to say, contraction ensues&mdash;and this evolves heat. This quantity
of heat may be calculated, but it cannot be said how much is expended in the
separation of the atoms of oxygen from each other, and, therefore, strictly speaking, we
do not know the quantity of heat which is evolved in the reaction alone, although the
number of units of heat evolved in the combustion of detonating gas is accurately
known.</p>

<p>The construction of the calorimeter and even the method of determination vary
considerably in different cases. Since the beginning of the nineties, a large number of
determinations of the heat of combustion have been conducted in closed bombs containing
compressed oxygen. The greatest number of calorimetric determinations were
made by Berthelot and Thomsen. They are given in their works <i>Essai de mécanique
chimique fondée sur la thermochimie</i>, by M. Berthelot, 1879 (2 vols.), and <i>thermochemische
Untersuchungen</i>, by J. Thomsen, 1886 (4 vols.) The most important methods
of recent thermochemistry, and all the trustworthy results of experiment, are given in
Prof. P. F. Louginin's <i>Description of the Different Modes of Determining the Heat of
Combustion of Organic Compounds</i>, Moscow, 1894. The student must refer to works
on theoretical and physical chemistry for a description of the elements and methods
of <i>thermochemistry</i>, into the details of which it is impossible to enter in this work. One
of the originators of thermochemistry, Hess, was a member of the St. Petersburg
Academy of Sciences. Since 1870 a large amount of research has been carried out in
this province of chemistry, especially in France and Germany, after the investigations
of the French Academician, Berthelot, and Professor Thomsen, of Copenhagen. Among
Russians, Beketoff, Louginin, Cheltzoff, Chroustchoff, and others are known by their
thermochemical researches. The present epoch of thermochemistry must be considered
rather as a collective one, wherein the material of facts is amassed, and the first consequences
arising from them are noticed. In my opinion two essential circumstances
prevent the possibility of deducing any exact consequences, of importance to chemical
mechanics, from the immense store of thermochemical data already collected: (1) The
majority of the determinations are conducted in weak aqueous solutions, and, the heat
of solution being known, are referred to the substances in solution; yet there is much
(Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.) which leads to the conclusion that in solution water does not play the
simple part of a diluting medium, but of itself acts independently in a chemical sense
on the substance dissolved. (2) Physical and mechanical changes (decrease of volume,
diffusion, and others) invariably proceed side by side with chemical changes, and for the
present it is impossible, in a number of cases, to distinguish the thermal effect of the one
and the other kind of change. It is evident that the one kind of change (chemical) is
essentially inseparable and incomprehensible without the other (mechanical and physical);
and therefore it seems to me that thermochemical data will only acquire their true
meaning when the connection between the phenomena of both kinds (on the one hand
chemical and atomic, and on the other hand mechanical and molecular or between
entire masses) is explained more clearly and fully than is at present the case. As there
is no doubt that the simple mechanical contact, or the action of heat alone, on substances
sometimes causes an evident and always a latent (incipient) chemical change&mdash;that
is, a different distribution or motion of the atoms in the molecules&mdash;it follows
that purely chemical phenomena are inseparable from physical and mechanical phenomena.
A mechanical change may be imagined without a physical change, and a physical
without a chemical change, but it is impossible to imagine a chemical change without
a physical and mechanical one, for without the latter we should not be able to recognise
the former, and it is by their means that we are enabled to do so.</p></div>

complex phenomenon, &lsquo;an entire factory,&rsquo; as Faraday says, and therefore we will consider
flame in some detail in one of the following notes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_215" id="Footnote_40_215"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_215"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> If 34,500 units of heat are evolved in the combustion of 1 part of hydrogen, and
this heat is transmitted to the resulting 9 parts by weight of aqueous vapour, then we
find that, taking the specific heat of the latter as 0·475, each unit of heat raises the
temperature of 1 part by weight of aqueous vapour 2°·1 and 9 parts by weight (2·1 ÷ 9)
O°·23; hence the 34,500 units of heat raise its temperature 7,935°. If detonating gas is
converted into water in a closed space, then the aqueous vapour formed cannot expand,
and therefore, in calculating the temperature of combustion, the specific heat at a constant
volume must be taken into consideration; for aqueous vapour it is 0·36. This
figure gives a still higher temperature for the flame. In reality it is much lower, but the
results given by different observers are very contradictory (from 1,700° to 2,400°), the
discrepancies depending on the fact that flames of different sizes are cooled by radiation
to a different degree, but mainly on the fact that the methods and apparatus (pyrometers)
for the determination of high temperatures, although they enable relative
changes of temperature to be judged, are of little use for determining their absolute
magnitude. By taking the temperature of the flame of detonating gas as 2,000°, I give,
I think, the average of the most trustworthy determinations and calculations based upon
the determination of the variation of the specific heat of aqueous vapour and other
gases (<i>see</i> Chapter XLI.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_216" id="Footnote_41_216"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_216"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> It is evident that not only hydrogen, but every other combustible gas, will give an
explosive mixture with oxygen. For this reason coal-gas mixed with air explodes when
the mixture is ignited. The pressure obtained in the explosions serves as the <i>motive
power of gas engines</i>. In this case advantage is taken, not only of the pressure produced
by the explosion, but also of that contraction which takes place after the explosion.
On this is based the construction of several motors, of which Lenoir's was formerly, and
Otto's is now, the best known. The explosion is usually produced by coal-gas and air,
but of late the vapours of combustible liquids (kerosene, benzene) are also being
employed in place of gas (Chapter <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>.) In Lenoir's engine a mixture of coal-gas and
air is ignited by means of sparks from a Ruhmkorff's coil, but in the most recent machines
the gases are ignited by the direct action of a gas jet, or by contact with the hot walls of
a side tube.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_BIS_217" id="Footnote_41_BIS_217"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_BIS_217"><span class="label">[41 bis]</span></a> Let us consider as an example the combustion of sulphur in air and in oxygen.
If 1 gram of sulphur burns in air or oxygen it evolves in either case 2250 units of heat&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
evolves sufficient heat for heating 2,250 grams of water 1° C. This heat is first of all
transmitted to the sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, formed by the combination of sulphur
with oxygen. In its combustion 1 gram of sulphur forms 2 grams of sulphurous anhydride&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the sulphur combines with 1 gram of oxygen. In order that 1 gram of
sulphur should have access to 1 gram of oxygen in air, it is necessary that 3·4 grams
of nitrogen should simultaneously reach the sulphur, because air contains seventy-seven
parts of nitrogen (by weight) per twenty-three parts of oxygen. Thus in the combustion
of 1 gram of sulphur, the 2,250 units of heat are transmitted to 2 grams of sulphurous
oxide and to at least 3·4 grams of nitrogen. As 0·155 unit of heat is required to raise
1 gram of sulphurous anhydride 1° C., therefore 2 grams require 0·31 unit. So also 3·4
grams of nitrogen require 3·4 × 0·244 or 0·83 unit of heat, and therefore in order to raise
both gases 1° C. 0·31 + 0·83 or 1·14 unit of heat is required; but as the combustion of
the sulphur evolves 2,250 units of heat, therefore the gases might be heated (if their
specific heats remained constant) to

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">2250</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">1·14</span>
</span>

or 1,974° C. That is, the maximum possible
temperature of the flame of the sulphur burning in air will be 1,974° C. In the combustion
of the sulphur in oxygen the heat evolved (2,250 units) can only pass to the 2 grams
of sulphurous anhydride, and therefore the highest possible temperature of the flame of
the sulphur in oxygen will be =

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">2250</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">0·31</span>
</span>

or 7258°. In the same manner it may be calculated
that the temperature of charcoal burning in air cannot exceed 2,700°, while in
oxygen it may attain 10,100° C. For this reason the temperature in oxygen will always
be higher than in air, although (judging from what has been said respecting detonating
gas) neither one temperature nor the other will ever approximate to the theoretical
amount.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_218" id="Footnote_42_218"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_218"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Faraday proved this by a very convincing experiment on a candle flame. If one
arm of a bent glass tube be placed in a candle flame above the wick in the dark portion
of the flame, then the products of the partial combustion of the stearin will pass up the
tube, condense in the other arm, and collect in a flask placed under it (fig. <a href="#fig_35">35</a>) as heavy
white fumes which burn when lighted. If the tube be raised into the upper luminous
portion of the flame, then a dense black smoke which will not inflame accumulates
in the flask. Lastly, if the tube be let down until it touches the wick, then little but
stearic acid condenses in the flask.</p></div>

pressure (according to the experiments of Frankland) are luminous when heated, because,
as they become denser they approach a liquid or solid state. Thus detonating
gas when exploded under pressure gives a brilliant light.</p></div>

through benzene (the benzene may be poured directly into the vessel in which hydrogen
is generated)&mdash;then its vapour burns with the hydrogen and gives a very bright flame,
because the resultant particles of carbon (soot) become incandescent. Benzene, or
platinum gauze, introduced into a hydrogen flame may be employed for illuminating
purposes.</p></div>

That portion of the flame whither the combustible vapours or gases flow, is not luminous
because its temperature is still too low for the process of combustion to take place in it.
This is the space which in a candle surrounds the wick, or in a gas jet is immediately
above the orifice from which the gas escapes. In a candle the combustible vapours and
gases which are formed by the action of heat on the melted tallow or stearin rise in the
wick, and are heated by the high temperature of the flame. By the action of the heat,
the solid or liquid substance is here, as in other cases, decomposed, forming products of
dry distillation. These products occur in the central portion of the flame of a candle.
The air travels to it from the outside, and is not able to intermix at once with the vapours
and gases in all parts of the flame equally; consequently,
in the outer portion of the flame the amount of oxygen will
be greater than in the interior portions. But, owing to
diffusion, the oxygen, of course mixed with nitrogen, flowing
towards the combustible substance, does finally penetrate to
the interior of the flame (when the combustion takes place
in ordinary air). The combustible vapours and gases combine
with this oxygen, evolve a considerable amount of heat, and
bring about that state of incandescence which is so necessary
both for keeping up the combustion and also for the uses to
which the flame is applied. Passing from the colder envelope
of air through the interior of the flame, to the source of the
combustible vapours (for instance, the wick), we evidently
first traverse layers of higher and higher temperature, and
then portions which are less and less hot, in which the combustion
is less complete, owing to the limited supply of oxygen.</p>

<p class="caption" style="width: 200px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 36.&mdash;In the candle flame
the portion C contains the
vapours and products of decomposition;
in the bright
zone A the combustion has
commenced, and particles
of carbon are emitted; and
in the pale zone B the combustion
is completed.</p></div>

<p>Thus unburnt products of the decomposition of organic
substances occur in the interior of the flame. But there is
always free hydrogen in the interior of the flame, even when
oxygen is introduced there, or when a mixture of hydrogen
and oxygen burns, because the temperature evolved in the
combustion of hydrogen or the carbon of organic matter is
so high that the products of combustion are themselves
partially decomposed&mdash;that is, dissociated&mdash;at this temperature.
Hence, in a flame a portion of the hydrogen and of
the oxygen which might combine with the combustible substances
must always be present in a free state. If a hydrocarbon
burns, and we imagine that a portion of the hydrogen
is in a free state, then a portion of the carbon must also occur
in the same form in the flame, because, other conditions
being unchanged, carbon burns after hydrogen, and this
is actually observed in the combustion of various hydrocarbons.
Charcoal, or the soot of a common flame, arises
from the dissociation of organic substances contained in the flame. The majority of
hydrocarbons, especially those containing much carbon&mdash;for instance, naphthalene&mdash;burn,
even in oxygen, with separation of soot. In that portion of the flame where
the hydrogen burns the carbon remains unburnt, or at least partly so. It is this
free carbon which causes the brilliancy of the flame. That the interior of the flame
contains a mixture which is still capable of combustion may be proved by the following
experiment: A portion of the gases may be withdrawn by an aspirator from
the central portion of the flame of carbonic oxide, which is combustible in air. For
this purpose Deville passed water through a metallic tube having a fine lateral orifice,
which is placed in the flame. As the water flows along the tube portions of the gases
of the flame enter, and, passing along the tube alternately with cylinders of water, are
carried away into an apparatus where they can be investigated. It appears that all
portions of the flame obtained by the combustion of a mixture of carbonic oxide and
oxygen contain a portion of this mixture still unburnt. The researches of Deville
and Bunsen showed that in the explosion of a mixture of hydrogen and of carbonic oxide
with oxygen in a closed space, complete combustion does not ever take place immediately.
If two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen be confined in a
closed space, then on explosion the pressure does not attain that magnitude which it
would were there immediate and complete combustion. It may be calculated that the
pressure should attain twenty-six atmospheres. In reality, it does not exceed nine and a
half atmospheres.</p>

<p>Hence the admixture of the products of combustion with an explosive mixture prevents
the combustion of the remaining mass, although capable of burning. The admixture
of carbonic anhydride prevents carbonic oxide from burning. The presence
of any other foreign gas interferes in the same manner. This shows that every portion
of a flame must contain combustible, burning, and already burnt substances&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> oxygen,
carbon, carbonic oxide, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, carbonic anhydride, and water. Consequently,
<i>it is impossible to attain instantaneous complete combustion</i>, and this is one
of the reasons of the phenomenon of flame. A certain space is required, and the temperature
must be unequal in different parts of it. In this space different quantities of
the component parts are successively subjected to combustion, or are cooled under the
influence of adjacent objects, and combustion only ends where the flame ends. If the
combustion could be concentrated at one spot, then the temperature would be incomparably
higher than it is under the actual circumstances.</p>

<p>The various regions of the flame have formed the frequent subject of experimental
research, and the experiments conducted by Smithells and Ingle (1892) are particularly
instructive; they show that the reducing (interior) and oxidising (exterior) portions of
the flame of a burning gas may be divided by taking a Bunsen burner and surrounding
the flame of the gas burnt in it, by another wider tube (without the access of air to the
annular space or allowing only a small current of air to pass), when a gaseous mixture,
containing oxide of carbon and capable of further combustion, will issue from this
enveloping tube, so that a second flame, corresponding to the exterior (oxidising) portion
of an ordinary flame, may be obtained above the enveloping tube. This division of the
flame into two portions is particularly clear when cyanogen C<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> is burnt, because the
interior portion (where CO is chiefly formed according to the equation C<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> =
2CO + N<sub>2</sub>, but a portion of the nitrogen is oxidised) is of a rose colour, while the exterior
portion (where the CO burns into CO<sub>2</sub> at the expense of a fresh quantity of oxygen
and of the oxides of nitrogen proceeding from the interior portions) is of a bluish-grey
colour.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_225" id="Footnote_49_225"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_225"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> It must be remarked that certain elements form oxides of all three kinds&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
indifferent, basic, and acid; for example, manganese forms manganous oxide, manganic
oxide, peroxide of manganese, red oxide of manganese, and manganic anhydride, although
some of them are not known in a free state but only in combination. The basic oxides
contain less oxygen than the peroxides, and the peroxides less than the acid anhydrides.
Thus they must be placed in the following general normal order with respect to the
amount of oxygen entering into their composition&mdash;(1) basic oxides, suboxides, and
oxides; (2) peroxides; (3) acid anhydrides. The majority of elements, however, do not
give all three kinds of oxides, some giving only one degree of oxidation. It must further
be remarked that there are oxides formed by the combination of acid anhydrides with
basic oxides, or, in general, of oxides with oxides. For every oxide having a higher and
a lower degree of oxidation, it might be said that the intermediate oxide was formed by
the combination of the higher with the lower oxide. But this is not true in all cases&mdash;for
instance, when the oxide under consideration forms a whole series of independent
compounds&mdash;for oxides which are really formed by the combination of two other oxides
do not give such independent compounds, but in many cases decompose into the higher
and lower oxides.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_226" id="Footnote_50_226"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_226"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> Blotting or unsized paper, soaked in a solution of litmus, is usually employed for
detecting the presence of acids. This paper is cut into strips, and is called <i>test paper</i>;
when dipped into acid it immediately turns red. This is a most sensitive reaction, and
may be employed for testing for the smallest traces of acids. If 10,000 parts by weight
of water be mixed with 1 part of sulphuric acid, the coloration is distinct, and it is
even perceptible on the addition of ten times more water. Certain precautions must,
however, be taken in the preparation of such very sensitive litmus paper. Litmus is
sold in lumps. Take, say, 100 grams of it; powder it, and add it to cold pure water in
a flask; shake and decant the water. Repeat this three times. This is done to wash
away easily-soluble impurities, especially alkalis. Transfer the washed litmus (it is washed
with absolute alcohol to remove the non-sensitive reddish colouring matter) to a flask,
and pour in 600 c.c. of water, heat, and allow the hot infusion to remain for some hours
in a warm place. Then filter, and divide the filtrate into two parts. Add a few drops of
nitric acid to one portion, so that a faint red tinge is obtained, and then mix the two
portions. Add spirit to the mixture, and keep it in a stoppered bottle (it soon spoils
if left open to the air). This infusion may be employed directly; it reddens in the
presence of acids, and turns blue in the presence of alkalis. If evaporated, a solid mass
is obtained which is soluble in water, and may be kept unchanged for any length of time.
The test paper may be prepared as follows:&mdash;Take a strong infusion of litmus, and soak
blotting-paper with it; dry it, and cut it into strips, and use it as test-paper for acids.
For the detection of alkalis, the paper must be soaked in a solution of litmus just reddened
by a few drops of acid; if too much acid be taken, the paper will not be sensitive.
Such acids as sulphuric acid colour litmus, and especially its infusion, a brick-red colour,
whilst more feeble acids, such as carbonic, give a faint red-wine tinge. Test-paper of a
yellow colour is also employed; it is dyed by an infusion of turmeric roots in spirit. In
alkalis it turns brown, but regains its original hue in acids. Many blue and other vegetable
colouring matters may be used for the detection of acids and alkalis; for example,
infusions of cochineal, violets, log-wood, &amp;c. Certain artificially prepared substances and
dyes may also be employed. Thus rosolic acid, C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and phenolphthaleïn, C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>14</sub>O<sub>4</sub>
(it is used in an alcoholic solution, and is not suitable for the detection of ammonia),
are colourless in an acid, and red in an alkaline, solution. Cyanine is also colourless in
the presence of acids, and gives a blue coloration with alkalis. Methyl-orange (yellow
in an aqueous solution) is not altered by alkalis but becomes pink with acids (weak
acids have no action), &amp;c. These are very sensitive tests. Their behaviour in respect to
various acids, alkalis, and salts sometimes give the means of distinguishing substances
from each other.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_227" id="Footnote_51_227"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_227"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> That water really is separated in the reaction of acid on alkaline hydrates, may be
shown by taking some other intermediate hydrate&mdash;for example, alumina&mdash;instead of
water. Thus, if a solution of alumina in sulphuric acid be taken, it will have, like the
acid, an acid reaction, and will therefore colour litmus red. If, on the other hand, a
solution of alumina in an alkali&mdash;say, potash&mdash;be taken, it will have an alkaline
reaction, and will turn red litmus blue. On adding the alkaline to the acid solution
until neither an alkaline nor an acid reaction is produced, a salt is formed, consisting of
sulphuric anhydride and potassium oxide. In this, as in the reaction of hydrates, an
intermediate oxide is separated out&mdash;namely, alumina. Its separation will be very evident
in this case, as alumina is insoluble in water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_228" id="Footnote_52_228"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_228"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> The mutual interaction of hydrates, and their capacity of forming salts, may be
taken advantage of for determining the character of those hydrates which are insoluble
in water. Let us imagine that a given hydrate, whose chemical character is unknown, is
insoluble in water. It is therefore impossible to test its reaction on litmus. It is then
mixed with water, and an acid&mdash;for instance, sulphuric acid&mdash;is added to the mixture. If
the hydrate taken be basic, reaction will take place, either directly or by the aid of
heat, with the formation of a salt. In certain cases, the resultant salt is soluble in
water, and this will at once show that combination has taken place between the insoluble
basic hydrate and the acid, with the formation of a soluble saline substance. In
those cases where the resultant salt is insoluble, still the water loses its acid reaction,
and therefore it may he ascertained, by the addition of an acid, whether a given hydrate
has a basic character, like the hydrates of oxide of copper, lead, &amp;c. If the acid does
not act on the given insoluble hydrate (at any temperature), then it has not a basic
character, and it should be tested as to whether it has an acid character. This is done
by taking an alkali, instead of the acid, and by observing whether the unknown hydrate
then dissolves, or whether the alkaline reaction disappears. Thus it may he proved that
hydrate of silica is acid, because it dissolves in alkalis and not in acids. If it be a case
of an insoluble intermediate hydrate, then it will be observed to react on both the acid
and alkali. Hydrate of alumina is an instance in question, which is soluble both in
caustic potash and in sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>The <i>degree of affinity</i> or chemical <i>energy</i> proper to oxides and their hydrates is very
dissimilar; some extreme members of the series possess it to a great extent. When
acting on each other they evolve a large quantity of heat, and when acting on intermediate
hydrates they also evolve heat to a considerable degree, as we saw in the combination
of lime and sulphuric anhydride with water. When extreme oxides combine they form
stable salts, which are decomposed with difficulty, and often show characteristic properties.
The compounds of the intermediate oxides with each other, or even with basic
and acid oxides, present a very different case. However much alumina we may dissolve
in sulphuric acid, we cannot saturate the acid properties of the sulphuric acid, the
resulting solution will always have an acid reaction. So also, whatever quantity of
alumina is dissolved in an alkali, the resulting solution will always present an alkaline
reaction.</p></div>

<p>These figures cannot be considered as the heat of neutralisation, because the water
here plays an important part. Thus, for instance, sulphuric acid and caustic soda in
dissolving in water evolve very much heat, and the resultant sodium sulphate very little;
consequently, the amount of heat evolved in an anhydrous combination will be different
from that evolved in a hydrated combination. Those acids which are not energetic in
combining with the same quantity of alkalis required for the formation of normal salts
of sulphuric or nitric acids always, however, give less heat. For instance, with caustic
soda: carbonic acid gives 10·2, hydrocyanic, 2·9, hydrogen sulphide, 3·9 major calories.
And as feeble bases (for example, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) also evolve less heat than those which are more
powerful, so a certain general correlation between thermochemical data and the degree of
affinity shows itself here, as in other cases (<i>see</i> Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_7_130">7</a>); this does not, however,
give any reason for measuring the affinity which binds the elements of salts by the
heat of their formation in dilute solutions. This is very clearly demonstrated by the
fact that water is able to decompose many salts, and is separated in their formation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_230" id="Footnote_54_230"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_230"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Carbonic anhydride evolves heat in dissolving in water. The solution easily dissociates
and evolves carbonic anhydride, according to the law of Henry and Dalton (<i>see</i>
Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.) In dissolving in caustic soda, it either gives a normal salt, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,
which does not evolve carbonic anhydride, or an acid salt, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> which easily evolves
carbonic anhydride when heated. The same gas, when dissolved in solutions of salts, acts
in one or the other manner (<i>see</i> Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_38_162">38</a>). Here it is seen what a successive
series of relations exists between compounds of a different order, between substances of
different degrees of stability. By making a distinction between the phenomena of solutions
and chemical compounds, we overlook those natural transitions which in reality
exist.</p></div>

sulphate into a U-shaped tube and inserting electrodes in the two branches. If the solution

by much more complex results. Thus, when the metal of the salt is capable of a
higher degree of oxidation, such a higher oxide may be formed at the positive pole by
the oxygen which is evolved there. This takes place, for instance, in the decomposition
of salts of silver and manganese by the galvanic current, peroxides of these metals
being formed. Thus in the electrolysis of a solution of KCl, KClO<sub>3</sub> is formed, and of
sulphuric acid (corresponding to SO<sub>3</sub>) persulphuric acid, corresponding to S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. But all
the phenomena as yet known may be expressed by the above law&mdash;that the current
decomposes salts into metals, which appear at the negative pole, and into the remaining

the metals (simple, or compound like ammonium, NH<sub>4</sub>), with the haloids (simple, like
chlorine, or compound, like cyanogen, CN, or the radical of sulphuric acid, SO<sub>4</sub>), capable
of entering into double saline decomposition, which is in accordance with the general
data respecting salts, was only formed little by little after a succession of most varied
propositions as to the chemical structure of salts.</p>

<p>Salts belong to the class of substances which have been known since very early times,
and have long been investigated in many directions. At first, however, no distinction
was made between salts, acids, and bases. Glauber prepared many artificial salts during
the latter half of the seventeenth century. Up to that time the majority of salts were
obtained from natural sources, and that salt which we have referred to several times&mdash;namely,
sodium sulphate&mdash;was named Glauber's salt after this chemist. Rouelle distinguished
normal, acid, and basic salts, and showed their action on vegetable dyes, still
he confounded many salts with acids (even now every acid salt ought to be regarded as
an acid, because it contains hydrogen, which may be replaced by metals&mdash;that is, it is
the hydrogen of an acid). Baumé disputed Rouelle's opinion concerning the subdivision
of salts, contending that normal salts only are true salts, and that basic salts are simple
mixtures of normal salts with bases and acid salts with acids, considering that washing
alone could remove the base or acid from them. Rouelle, in the middle of the last century,
however, rendered a great service to the study of salts and the diffusion of knowledge
respecting this class of compounds in his attractive lectures. He, like the majority
of the chemists of that period, did not employ the balance in his researches, but satisfied
himself with purely qualitative data. The first quantitative researches on salts were
carried on about this time by Wenzel, who was the director of the Freiburg mines, in
Saxony. Wenzel studied the double decomposition of salts, and observed that in the
double decomposition of neutral salts a neutral salt was always obtained. He proved,
by a method of weighing, that this is due to the fact that the saturation of a given
quantity of a base requires such relative quantities of different acids as are capable of
saturating every other base. Having taken two neutral salts&mdash;for example, sodium sulphate
and calcium nitrate&mdash;let us mix their solutions together. Double decomposition
takes place, because calcium sulphate is formed, which is almost insoluble. However
much we might add of each of the salts, the neutral reaction will still be preserved,
consequently the neutral character of the salts is not destroyed by the interchange of
metals; that is to say, that quantity of sulphuric acid which saturated the sodium is
sufficient for the saturation of the calcium, and that amount of nitric acid which saturated
the calcium is enough to saturate the sodium contained in combination with
sulphuric acid in sodium sulphate. Wenzel was even convinced that matter does not
disappear in nature, and on this principle he corrects, in his <i>Doctrine of Affinity</i>, the
results of his experiments when he found that he obtained less than he had originally
taken. Although Wenzel deduced the law of the double decomposition of salts
quite correctly, he did not determine those quantities in which acids and bases act on
each other. This was carried out at the end of the last century by Richter. He determined
the quantities by weight of the bases which saturate acids and of the acids which
saturate bases, and obtained comparatively correct results, although his conclusions
were not correct, for he states that the quantity of a base saturating a given acid varies
in arithmetical progression, and the quantity of an acid saturating a given base in geometrical
progression. Richter studied the deposition of metals from their salts by other
metals, and observed that the neutral reaction of the solution is not destroyed by this
exchange. He also determined the quantities by weight of the metals replacing one
another in salts. He showed that copper displaces silver from its salt, and that zinc
displaces copper and a whole series of other metals. Those quantities of metals which
were capable of replacing one another were termed equivalents.</p>

<p>Richter's teaching found no followers, because, although he fully believed in the discoveries
of Lavoisier, yet he still held to the phlogistic reasonings which rendered his
expositions very obscure. The works of the Swedish savant Berzelius freed the facts
discovered by Wenzel and Richter from the obscurity of former conceptions, and led to
their being explained in accordance with Lavoisier's views, and in the sense of the law
of multiple proportions which had already been discovered by Dalton. On applying to
salts those conclusions which Berzelius arrived at by a whole series of researches of
remarkable accuracy, we arrive at the following law of equivalents&mdash;<i>one part by weight
of hydrogen in an acid is replaced by the corresponding equivalent weight of any
metal</i>; and, therefore, when metals replace each other their weights are in the same
ratio as their equivalents. Thus, for instance, one part by weight of hydrogen is replaced
by 23 parts of sodium, 39 parts of potassium, 12 parts of magnesium, 20 parts of calcium,
28 parts of iron, 108 parts of silver, 33 parts of zinc, &amp;c.; and, therefore, if zinc
replaces silver, then 33 parts of zinc will take the place of 108 parts of silver, or 33 parts
of zinc will he substituted by 23 parts of sodium, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The doctrine of equivalents would be precise and simple did every metal only give
one oxide or one salt. It is rendered complicated from the fact that many metals form
several oxides, and consequently offer different equivalents in their different degrees of
oxidation. For example, there are oxides containing iron in which its equivalent is
28&mdash;this is in the salts formed by the suboxide; and there is another series of salts
in which the equivalent of iron equals 18&#8532;&mdash;which contain less iron, and consequently
more oxygen, and correspond with a higher degree of oxidation&mdash;ferric oxide. It is true
that the former salts are easily formed by the direct action of metallic iron on acids, and
the latter only by a further oxidation of the compound formed already; but this is not
always so. In the case of copper, mercury, and tin, under different circumstances, salts
are formed which correspond with different degrees of oxidation of these metals, and
many metals have two equivalents in their different salts&mdash;that is, in salts corresponding
with the different degrees of oxidation. Thus it is impossible to endow every metal with
one definite equivalent weight. Hence the conception of equivalents, while playing
an important part from an historical point of view, appears, with a fuller study of
chemistry, to be but subordinate to a higher conception, with which we shall afterwards
become acquainted.</p>

<p>The fate of the theoretical views of chemistry was for a long time bound up with
the history of salts. The clearest representation of this subject dates back to Lavoisier,
and was systematically developed by Berzelius. This representation is called the <i>binary</i>
theory. All compounds, and especially salts, are represented as consisting of two parts.
Salts are represented as compounds of a basic oxide (a base) and an acid (that is, an
anhydride of an acid, then termed an acid), whilst hydrates are represented as compounds
of anhydrous oxides with water. Such an expression was employed not only to
denote the most usual method of formation of these substances (where it would be quite
true), but also to express that internal distribution of the elements by which it was
proposed to explain all the properties of these substances. Copper sulphate was supposed
to contain two most intimate component parts&mdash;copper oxide and sulphuric anhydride.
This is an hypothesis. It arose from the so-called <i>electro-chemical hypothesis</i>,
which supposed the two component parts to be held in mutual union, because one component
(the anhydride of the acid) has electro-negative properties, and the other (the
base in salts) electro-positive. The two parts are attracted together, like substances
having opposite electrical charges. But as the decomposition of salts in a state of fusion
by an electric current always gives a metal, that representation of the constitution
and decomposition of salts called the <i>hydrogen theory</i> of acids is nearer the truth than
that which considers salts as made up of a base and an anhydride of an acid. But the
hydrogen theory of acids is also a binary hypothesis, and does not contradict the
electro-chemical hypothesis, but is rather a modification of it. The binary theory dates
from Rouelle and Lavoisier, the electro-chemical aspect was zealously developed by
Berzelius, and the hydrogen theory of acids is due to Davy and Liebig.</p>

<p>These hypothetical views simplified and generalised the study of a complicated
subject, and served to support further arguments, but when salts were in question it
was equally convenient to follow one or the other of these hypotheses. But these
theories were brought to bear on all other substances, on all compound substances.
Those holding the binary and electro-chemical hypotheses searched for two anti-polar
component parts, and endeavoured to express the process of chemical reactions by electro-chemical
and similar differences. If zinc replaces hydrogen, they concluded that it is
more electro-positive than hydrogen, whilst they forgot that hydrogen may, under different
circumstances, displace zinc&mdash;for instance, at a red heat. Chlorine and oxygen were considered
as being of opposite polarity to hydrogen because they easily combine with it,
nevertheless both are capable of replacing hydrogen, and, what is very characteristic,
in the replacement of hydrogen by chlorine in carbon compounds not only does the
chemical character often remain unaltered, but even the external form may remain
unchanged, as Laurent and Dumas demonstrated. These considerations undermine the
binary, and more especially the electro-chemical theory. An explanation of known
reactions then began to be sought for not in the difference of the polarity of the different
substances, but in the joint influences of all the elements on the properties of the compound
formed. This is the reverse of the preceding hypothesis.</p>

<p>This reversal was not, however, limited to the destruction of the tottering foundations
of the preceding theory; it proposed a new doctrine, and laid the foundation for the
modern course of our science. This doctrine may be termed the unitary theory&mdash;that is,
it strictly acknowledges the joint influences of the elements in a compound substance,
denies the existence of separate and contrary components in them, regards copper
sulphate, for instance, as a strictly definite compound of copper, sulphur, and oxygen;
then seeks for compounds which are analogous in their properties, and, placing them side
by side, endeavours to express the influence of each element in determining the united
properties of its compound. In the majority of cases it arrives at conclusions similar to
those which are obtained by the above-mentioned hypotheses, but in certain special cases
the conclusions of the unitary theory are in entire opposition to those of the binary theory
and its corollaries. Cases of this kind are most often met with in the consideration of
compounds of a more complex nature than salts, especially organic compounds containing
hydrogen. But it is not in this change from an artificial to a natural system, important
as it is, that the chief service and strength of the unitary doctrine lies. By a simple
review of the vast store of data regarding the reactions of typical substances, it succeeded
from its first appearance in establishing a new and important law, it introduced a new
conception into science&mdash;namely, the conception of molecules, with which we shall soon
become acquainted. The deduction of the law and of the conception of molecules has
been verified by facts in a number of cases, and was the cause of the majority of chemists
of our times deserting the binary theory and accepting the unitary theory, which forms
the basis of the present work. Laurent and Gerhardt must be considered as the founders
of this doctrine.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">OZONE AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE&mdash;DALTON'S LAW</span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">VAN MARUM</span>, during the last century, observed that oxygen in a glass
tube, when subjected to the action of a series of electric sparks, acquired
a peculiar smell, and the property of combining with mercury at the
ordinary temperature. This was afterwards confirmed by a number of
fresh experiments. Even in the simple revolution of an electrical
machine, when electricity diffuses into the air or passes through it, the
peculiar and characteristic smell of ozone, proceeding from the action
of the electricity on the oxygen of the atmosphere, is recognised. In
1840 Prof. Schönbein, of Basle, turned his attention to this odoriferous
substance, and showed that it is also formed, with the
oxygen evolved at the positive pole, in the decomposition of water
by the action of a galvanic current; in the oxidation of phosphorus
in damp air, and also in the oxidation of a number of substances,
although it is distinguished for its instability and capacity for oxidising
other substances. The characteristic smell of this substance gave
it its name, from the Greek &#8004;&#950;&#969;, &lsquo;I emit an odour.&rsquo; Schönbein
pointed out that <i>ozone</i> is capable of oxidising many substances
on which oxygen does not act at the ordinary temperature. It
will be sufficient to point out for instance that it oxidises silver, mercury,
charcoal, and iron with great energy at the ordinary temperature.
It might be thought that ozone was some new compound substance, as
it was at first supposed to be; but careful observations made in this
direction have long led to the conclusion that ozone is nothing but
oxygen altered in its properties. This is most strikingly proved by the
complete transformation of oxygen containing ozone into ordinary
oxygen when it is passed through a tube heated to 250°. Further, at
a low temperature pure oxygen gives ozone when electric sparks are
passed through it (Marignac and De la Rive). Hence it is proved both
by synthesis and analysis that ozone is that same oxygen with which we
are already acquainted, only endowed with particular properties and in
a particular state. However, by whatever method it be obtained, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
amount of it contained in the oxygen is inconsiderable, generally only a
few fractions per cent., rarely 2 per cent., and only under very propitious
circumstances as much as 20 per cent. The reason of this must be
looked for first in the fact that <i>ozone in its formation from oxygen
absorbs heat</i>. If any substance be burnt in a calorimeter at the expense
of ozonised oxygen, then more heat is evolved than when it is burnt in
ordinary oxygen, and Berthelot showed that this difference is very
large&mdash;namely, 29,600 heat units correspond with every forty-eight
parts by weight of ozone. This signifies that the transformation of
forty-eight parts of oxygen into ozone is accompanied by the absorption
of this quantity of heat, and that the reverse process evolves this
quantity of heat. Therefore the passage of ozone into oxygen should
take place easily and fully (as an exothermal reaction), like combustion;
and this is proved by the fact that at 250° ozone entirely disappears,
forming oxygen. Any rise of temperature may thus bring about the
breaking up of ozone, and as a rise of temperature takes place in the
action of an electrical discharge, there are in an electric discharge the
conditions both for the preparation of ozone and for its destruction.
Hence it is clear that the transformation of oxygen into ozone <i>as a
reversible reaction</i> has a limit when a state of equilibrium is arrived at
between the products of the two opposite reactions, that the phenomena
of this transformation accord with the phenomena of <i>dissociation</i>, and
that a fall of temperature should aid the formation of a large quantity
of ozone.<a name="FNanchor_1_234" id="FNanchor_1_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_234" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Further, it is evident, from what has been said, that the
best way of preparing ozone is not by electric sparks,<a name="FNanchor_2_235" id="FNanchor_2_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_235" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> which raise the
temperature, but by the employment of a continual discharge or flow
of electricity&mdash;that is, by the action of a <i>silent discharge</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_236" id="FNanchor_3_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_236" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
reason all <i>ozonisers</i> (which are of most varied construction), or forms of
apparatus for the preparation of ozone from oxygen (or air) by the
action of electricity, now usually consist of sheets of metal&mdash;for instance,
tinfoil&mdash;a solution of sulphuric acid mixed with chromic acid,
&amp;c. separated by thin glass surfaces placed at short distances from each
other, and between which the oxygen or air to be ozonised is introduced
and subjected to the action of a silent discharge.<a name="FNanchor_4_237" id="FNanchor_4_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_237" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Thus in Siemens'
apparatus (fig. <a href="#fig_37">37</a>) the exterior of the tube <i>a</i> and the interior of the
tube <i>b c</i> are coated with tinfoil and connected with the poles of a source
of electricity (with the terminals of a Ruhmkorff's coil). A silent discharge
passes through the thin walls of the glass cylinders <i>a</i> and <i>b c</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
over all their surfaces, and consequently, if oxygen be passed through
the apparatus by the tube <i>d</i>, fused into the side of <i>a</i>, it will be ozonised
in the annular space between <i>a</i> and <i>b c</i>. The ozonised oxygen escapes
by the tube <i>e</i>, and may be introduced into any other apparatus.<a name="FNanchor_5_238" id="FNanchor_5_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_238" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p><i>The properties of ozone</i> obtained by such a method<a name="FNanchor_6_239" id="FNanchor_6_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_239" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> distinguish it
in many respects from oxygen. Ozone very rapidly decolorises indigo,
litmus, and many other dyes by oxidising them. Silver is oxidised by
it at the ordinary temperature, whilst oxygen is not able to oxidise
silver even at high temperatures; a bright silver plate rapidly turns
black (from oxidation) in ozonised oxygen. It is rapidly absorbed by
mercury, forming oxide; it transforms the lower oxides into higher&mdash;for
instance, sulphurous anhydride into sulphuric, nitrous oxide into
nitric, arsenious anhydride (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) into arsenic anhydride (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_7_240" id="FNanchor_7_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_240" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
But what is especially characteristic in ozone is the decomposing action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
it exerts on potassium iodide. Oxygen does not act on it, but ozone
passed into a solution of potassium iodide <i>liberates iodine</i>, whilst the
potassium is obtained as caustic potash, which remains in solution,
2KI + H<sub>2</sub>O + O = 2KHO + I<sub>2</sub>. As the presence of minute traces of free
iodine may be discovered by means of starch paste, with which it forms
a very dark blue-coloured substance, a mixture of potassium iodide with
starch paste will detect the presence of very small traces of ozone.<a name="FNanchor_8_241" id="FNanchor_8_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_241" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Ozone is destroyed or converted into ordinary oxygen not only by heat,
but also by long keeping, especially in the presence of alkalis, peroxide
of manganese, chlorine, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Hence <i>ozone</i>, although it has the same <i>composition as oxygen</i>, differs
from it in stability, and by the fact that it oxidises a number of substances
very energetically at the ordinary temperature. In this respect
ozone resembles the oxygen of certain unstable compounds, or oxygen
at the moment of its liberation.<a name="FNanchor_8_BIS_242" id="FNanchor_8_BIS_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_BIS_242" class="fnanchor">[8 bis]</a></p>

<p>In ordinary oxygen and ozone we see an example of one and the
same substance, in this case an element, appearing in two states. This
indicates that the properties of a substance, and even of an element,
may vary without its composition varying. Very many such cases
are known. Such cases of a chemical transformation which determine
a difference in the properties of one and the same element are termed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
cases of isomerism. The cause of isomerism evidently lies deep within
the essential conditions of a substance, and its investigation has already
led to a number of results of unexpected importance and of immense
scientific significance. It is easy to understand the difference between
substances containing different elements or the same elements in
different proportions. That a difference should exist in these cases
necessarily follows, if, as our knowledge compels us, we admit that
there is a radical difference in the simple bodies or elements. But
when the composition&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the quality and quantity of the elements
in two substances is the same and yet their properties are different,
then it becomes clear that the conceptions of diverse elements and of the
varying composition of compounds, alone, are insufficient for the expression
of all the diversity of properties of matter in nature. Something
else, still more profound and internal than the composition of substances,
must, judging from isomerism, determine the properties and
transformation of substances.</p>

<p>On what are the isomerism of ozone and oxygen, and the peculiarities
of ozone, dependent? In what, besides the extra store of energy,
which is one of the peculiarities of ozone, resides the cause of its
difference from oxygen? These questions for long occupied the minds
of investigators, and were the motive for the most varied, exact, and
accurate researches, which were chiefly directed to the study of the
volumetric relations exhibited by ozone. In order to acquaint the
reader with the previous researches of this kind, I cite the following
from a memoir by Soret, in the &lsquo;Transactions of the French Academy of
Sciences&rsquo; for 1866:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Our present knowledge of the volumetric relations of ozone may be
expressed in the following manner:</p>

<p>&lsquo;1. &ldquo;Ordinary oxygen in changing into ozone under the action of
electricity shows a diminution in volume.&rdquo; This was discovered by
Andrews and Tait.</p>

<p>&lsquo;2. &ldquo;In acting on ozonised oxygen with potassium iodide and other
substances capable of being oxidised, we destroy the ozone, but the
volume of the gas remains unchanged.&rdquo; For the researches of Andrews,
Soret, v. Babo, and others showed that the proportion of ozonised
oxygen absorbed by the potassium iodide is equal to the original contraction
of volume of the oxygen&mdash;that is, in the absorption of the ozone
the volume of the gas remains unchanged. From this it might be
imagined that ozone, so to say, does not occupy any space&mdash;is indefinitely
dense.</p>

<p>&lsquo;3. &ldquo;By the action of heat ozonised oxygen increases in volume,
and is transformed into ordinary oxygen. This increase in volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
corresponds with the quantity of ozonised oxygen which is given up to
the potassium iodide in its decomposition&rdquo; (the same observers).</p>

<p>&lsquo;4. These unquestionable experimental results lead to the conclusion
that ozone is denser than oxygen, and that in its oxidising action it
gives off that portion of its substance to which is due its extra density
distinguishing it from ordinary oxygen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>If we imagine (says Weltzien) that <i>n</i> volumes of ozone consist of <i>n</i>
volumes of oxygen combined with <i>m</i> volumes of the same substance, and
that ozone in oxidising gives up <i>m</i> volumes of oxygen and leaves <i>n</i>
volumes of ordinary oxygen gas, then all the above facts can be explained;
otherwise it must be supposed that ozone is infinitely dense.
&lsquo;In order to determine the density of ozone&rsquo; (we again cite Soret) &lsquo;recourse
cannot be had to the direct determination of the weight of a given
volume of the gas, because ozone cannot be obtained in a pure state. It is
always mixed with a very large quantity of oxygen. It was necessary,
therefore, to have recourse to such substances as would absorb ozone
without absorbing oxygen and without destroying the ozone. Then the
density might be deduced from the decrease of volume produced in the
gas by the action of this solvent in comparison with the quantity of
oxygen given up to potassium iodide. Advantage must also be taken
of the determination of the increase of volume produced by the action
of heat on ozone, if the volume occupied by the ozone before heating
be known.&rsquo; Soret found two such substances, turpentine and oil of
cinnamon. &lsquo;Ozone disappears in the presence of turpentine. This is
accompanied by the appearance of a dense vapour, which fills a vessel
of small capacity (0·14 litre) to such an extent that it is impenetrable
to direct solar-rays. On leaving the vessel at rest, it is observed that
the cloud of vapour settles; the clearing is first remarked at the upper
portion of the vessel, and the brilliant colours of the rainbow are seen on
the edge of a cloud of vapour.&rsquo; Oil of cinnamon&mdash;that is, the volatile or
essential oil of the well-known spice, cinnamon&mdash;gives under similar
circumstances the same kind of vapours, but they are much less voluminous.
On measuring the gaseous volume before and after the action
of both volatile oils, a considerable decrease is remarked. On applying
all the necessary corrections (for the solubility of oxygen in the oily
liquids named above, for the tension of their vapour, for the change of
pressure, &amp;c.) and making a series of comparative determinations, Soret
obtained the following result: two volumes of ozone capable of being dissolved,
when changed to ordinary (by heating a wire to a red-heat by a
galvanic current) increase by one volume. Hence it is evident that in
the formation of ozone three volumes of oxygen give two volumes of
ozone&mdash;that is, its density (referred to hydrogen) = 24.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>The observations and determinations of Soret showed that ozone
is heavier than oxygen, and even than carbonic anhydride (because
ozonised oxygen passes through fine orifices more slowly than oxygen
and than its mixtures with carbonic anhydride), although lighter than
chlorine (it flows more rapidly through such orifices than chlorine), and
they indicated that <i>ozone is one and a half times denser than oxygen</i>,
which may be expressed by designating a molecule of oxygen by O<sub>2</sub>
and of ozone by O<sub>3</sub>, and hence ozone OO<sub>2</sub> is comparable with compound
substances<a name="FNanchor_9_243" id="FNanchor_9_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_243" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> formed by oxygen, as for instance CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.
This explains the chief differences between ozone and oxygen and the
cause of the isomerism, and at the same time leads one to expect<a name="FNanchor_10_244" id="FNanchor_10_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_244" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
that ozone, being a gas which is denser than oxygen, would be liquefied
much more easily. This was actually shown to be the case in 1880, by
Chappuis and Hautefeuille in their researches on the <i>physical properties
of ozone</i>. Its boiling point under a pressure of 760 mm. is about -106°,
and consequently compressed and refrigerated ozone when rapidly expanded
forms drops, <i>i.e.</i> is liquefied. Liquid and compressed<a name="FNanchor_11_245" id="FNanchor_11_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_245" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> ozone is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
blue. In dissolving in water ozone partly passes into oxygen. It
explodes violently when suddenly compressed and heated, changing into
ordinary oxygen and evolving, like all explosive substances,<a name="FNanchor_12_246" id="FNanchor_12_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_246" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> that extra
heat which distinguishes it from oxygen.</p>

<p>Thus, judging by what has been said above, ozone should he formed
in nature not only in the many processes of oxidation which go on, but
also by the condensation of atmospheric oxygen. The significance of
ozone in nature has often arrested the attention of observers. There is
a series of ozonometrical observations which show the different amounts
of ozone in the air at different localities, at different times of the year,
and under different circumstances. But the observations made in this
direction cannot be considered as sufficiently exact, because the methods
in use for determining ozone were not quite accurate. It is however
indisputable<a name="FNanchor_13_247" id="FNanchor_13_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_247" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> that the amount of ozone in the atmosphere is subject to
variation; that the air of dwellings contains no ozone (it disappears in
oxidising organic matter); that the air of fields and forests always contains
ozone, or substances (peroxide of hydrogen) which act like it (on
iodised starch paper &amp;c.)<a name="FNanchor_13_BIS_248" id="FNanchor_13_BIS_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_BIS_248" class="fnanchor">[13 bis]</a>; that the amount of ozone increases after
storms; and that miasms, &amp;c., are destroyed by ozonising the atmosphere.
It easily oxidises organic substances, and miasms are produced
by organic substances and the germs of organisms, all of which are easily
changed and oxidised. Indeed, many miasms&mdash;for instance, the volatile
substance of decomposing organisms&mdash;are clearly destroyed or changed
not only by ozone, but also by many other powerfully oxidising substances,
such as chlorine water, potassium permanganate, and the like.<a name="FNanchor_14_249" id="FNanchor_14_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_249" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> All
that is now known respecting the presence of ozone in the air may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
summed up in the following words: A small quantity of an oxidising
substance, resembling ozone in its reactions, has undoubtedly been
observed and determined in the atmosphere, especially in fresh air, for
instance after a storm, and it is very likely that this substance contains
a mixture of such oxidising substances as ozone, peroxide of hydrogen,
and the lower oxides of nitrogen (especially nitrous acid and its ammonia
salt) produced from the elements of the atmosphere by oxidation and
by the action of electrical discharges.</p>

<p>Thus in ozone we see (1) the capacity of elements (and it must be
all the more marked in compounds) of changing in properties without
altering in composition; this is termed isomerism;<a name="FNanchor_15_250" id="FNanchor_15_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_250" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> (2) the capacity
of certain elements for condensing themselves into molecules of different
densities; this forms a special case of isomerism called <i>polymerism</i>;
(3) the capacity of oxygen for appearing in a still more active and
energetic chemical state than that in which it occurs in ordinary
gaseous oxygen; and (4) the formation of unstable equilibria, or
chemical states, which are illustrated both by the ease with which
ozone acts as an oxidiser and by its capacity for decomposing with
explosion.<a name="FNanchor_16_251" id="FNanchor_16_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_251" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><i>Hydrogen peroxide.</i>&mdash;Many of those properties which we have seen
in ozone belong also to a peculiar substance containing oxygen and
hydrogen and called hydrogen peroxide or oxygenated water. This
substance was discovered in 1818 by Thénard. When heated it is
decomposed into water and oxygen, evolving as much oxygen as is
contained in the water remaining after the decomposition. That
portion of oxygen by which hydrogen peroxide differs from water behaves
in a number of cases just like the active oxygen in ozone, which
distinguishes it from ordinary oxygen. In H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and in O<sub>3</sub>, one atom
of oxygen acts as a powerful oxidiser, and on separating out it
leaves H<sub>2</sub>O or O<sub>2</sub>, which do not act so energetically, although they
still contain oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_17_252" id="FNanchor_17_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_252" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Both H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> contain the oxygen in a compressed
state, so to speak, and when freed from pressure by the forces
(internal) of the elements in another substance, this oxygen is easily
evolved, and therefore acts as oxygen does at the moment of its liberation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Both substances in decomposing, with the separation of a portion of
their oxygen, <i>evolve</i> heat, whilst decomposition is usually accompanied
by an absorption of heat.</p>

<p>Hydrogen peroxide is formed under many circumstances by combustion
and oxidation, but in very limited quantities; thus, for instance,
it is sufficient to shake up zinc with sulphuric acid, or even with water,
to observe the formation of a certain quantity of hydrogen peroxide in
the water.<a name="FNanchor_18_253" id="FNanchor_18_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_253" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> From this cause, probably, a series of diverse oxidation
processes are accomplished in nature, and according to Prof. Schöne of
Moscow, hydrogen peroxide occurs in the atmosphere, although in variable
and small quantities, and probably its formation is connected with
ozone, with which it has much in common. The usual mode of the
formation of hydrogen peroxide, and the method by which it may be indirectly
obtained,<a name="FNanchor_19_254" id="FNanchor_19_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_254" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> is by the double decomposition of an acid and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
peroxides of certain metals, especially those of potassium, calcium, and
barium.<a name="FNanchor_20_255" id="FNanchor_20_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_255" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> We saw when speaking of Oxygen (Chap. <a href="#Page_152">III</a>.) that it is only
necessary to heat the anhydrous oxide of barium to a red heat in a
current of air or oxygen (or, better still, to heat it with potassium
chlorate, and then to wash away the potassium chloride formed) to obtain
peroxide of barium.<a name="FNanchor_21_256" id="FNanchor_21_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_256" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Barium peroxide gives hydrogen peroxide
by the action of acids in the cold.<a name="FNanchor_22_257" id="FNanchor_22_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_257" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The process of decomposition is
very clear in this case; the hydrogen of the acid replaces the barium
of the peroxide, a barium salt of the acid being formed, while the
hydrogen peroxide formed in the reaction remains in solution.<a name="FNanchor_23_258" id="FNanchor_23_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_258" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The reaction is expressed by the equation BaO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
+ BaSO<sub>4</sub>. It is best to take a weak cold solution of sulphuric acid and
to almost saturate it with barium peroxide, so that a small excess of acid
remains; insoluble barium sulphate is formed. A more or less dilute
aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide is obtained. This solution may
be concentrated in a vacuum over sulphuric acid. In this way the
water may even be entirely evaporated from the solution of the hydrogen
peroxide; only in this case it is necessary to work at a low temperature,
and not to keep the peroxide for long in the rarefied atmosphere,
as otherwise it decomposes.<a name="FNanchor_23_BIS_259" id="FNanchor_23_BIS_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_BIS_259" class="fnanchor">[23 bis]</a> A solution of peroxide of
hydrogen (mixed with the solution of a salt of sodium NaX) is used for
bleaching (especially silk and wool) on a large scale, and is now usually
prepared from peroxide of sodium Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> by the action of acids. Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
+ 2HX = 2NaX + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub><a name="FNanchor_24_260" id="FNanchor_24_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_260" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>.</p>

<p>When pure, hydrogen peroxide is a colourless liquid, without smell,
and having a very unpleasant taste&mdash;such as belongs to the salts of
many metals&mdash;the so-called &lsquo;metallic&rsquo; taste. Water stored in zinc vessels
has this taste, which is probably due to its containing hydrogen peroxide.
The tension of the vapour of hydrogen peroxide is less than that
of aqueous vapour; this enables its solutions to be concentrated in a
vacuum. The specific gravity of anhydrous hydrogen peroxide is 1·455.
Hydrogen peroxide decomposes, with the evolution of oxygen, when
heated even to 20°. But the more dilute its aqueous solution the more
stable it is. Very weak solutions may be distilled without decomposing
the hydrogen peroxide. It decolorises solutions of litmus and turmeric,
and acts in a similar manner on many colouring matters of organic
origin (for which reason it is employed for bleaching tissues).<a name="FNanchor_24_BIS_261" id="FNanchor_24_BIS_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_BIS_261" class="fnanchor">[24 bis]</a></p>

<p><i>Many substances decompose hydrogen peroxide</i>, forming water and
oxygen, without apparently suffering any change. In this case substances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in a state of fine division show a much quicker action than compact
masses, from which it is evident that the action is here based on
contact (<i>see</i> Introduction). It is sufficient to bring hydrogen peroxide
into contact with charcoal, gold, the peroxide of manganese or lead, the
alkalis, metallic silver, and platinum, to bring about the above decomposition.<a name="FNanchor_25_262" id="FNanchor_25_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_262" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
Besides which, hydrogen peroxide forms water and parts
with its oxygen with great ease to a number of substances which are
capable of being oxidised or of combining with oxygen, and in this respect
is very like ozone and other <i>powerful oxidisers</i>.<a name="FNanchor_26_263" id="FNanchor_26_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_263" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> To the class of
contact phenomena, which are so characteristic of hydrogen peroxide as a
substance which is unstable and easily decomposable with the evolution
of heat, must be referred the following&mdash;that in the presence of many
substances containing oxygen it evolves, not only its own oxygen, but
also that of the substances which are brought into contact with it&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
is, <i>it acts in a reducing manner</i>. It behaves thus with ozone, the
oxides of silver, mercury, gold and platinum, and lead peroxide. The
oxygen in these substances is not stable, and therefore the feeble
influence of contact is enough to destroy its position. Hydrogen peroxide,
especially in a concentrated form, in contact with these substances,
evolves an immense quantity of oxygen, so that an explosion takes
place and an exceedingly powerful evolution of heat is observed if
hydrogen peroxide in a concentrated form be made to drop upon
these substances in dry powder. Slow decomposition also proceeds in
dilute solutions.<a name="FNanchor_27_264" id="FNanchor_27_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_264" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Just as a whole series of metallic compounds, and especially the
oxides and their hydrates, correspond with water, so also there are
many substances analogous to hydrogen peroxide. Thus, for instance,
calcium peroxide is related to hydrogen peroxide in exactly the same
way as calcium oxide or lime is related to water. In both cases the
hydrogen is replaced by a metal&mdash;namely, by calcium.<a name="FNanchor_27_BIS_265" id="FNanchor_27_BIS_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_BIS_265" class="fnanchor">[27 bis]</a> But it is
most important to remark that the nearest approach to the properties
of hydrogen peroxide is afforded by a non-metallic element, chlorine;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
its action on colouring matters, its capacity for oxidising, and for
evolving oxygen from many oxides, is analogous to that exhibited by
hydrogen peroxide. Even the very formation of chlorine is closely
analogous to the formation of peroxide of hydrogen; chlorine is
obtained from manganese peroxide, MnO<sub>2</sub>, and hydrochloric acid, HCl,
and hydrogen peroxide from barium peroxide, BaO<sub>2</sub>, and the same
acid. The result in one case is essentially water, chlorine, and
manganese chloride; and in the other case barium chloride and hydrogen
peroxide are produced. Hence water + chlorine corresponds with
hydrogen peroxide, and the action of chlorine in the presence of water
is analogous to the action of hydrogen peroxide. This analogy between
chlorine and hydrogen peroxide is expressed in the conception of an
aqueous radicle, which (Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>.) has been already mentioned.
<i>This aqueous radicle</i> (or hydroxyl) is that which is left from water if
it be imagined as deprived of half of its hydrogen. According to this
method of expression, caustic soda will be a compound of sodium with
the aqueous radicle, because it is formed from water with the evolution
of half the hydrogen. This is expressed by the following formulæ:
water, H<sub>2</sub>O, caustic soda, NaHO, just as hydrochloric acid is HCl and
sodium chloride NaCl. Hence the aqueous radicle HO is a compound
radicle, just as chlorine, Cl, is a simple radicle. They both give hydrogen
compounds, HHO, water, and HCl, hydrochloric acid; sodium
compounds, NaHO and NaCl, and a whole series of analogous compounds.
Free chlorine in this sense will be ClCl, and hydrogen
peroxide HOHO, which indeed expresses its composition, because it
contains twice as much oxygen as water does.<a name="FNanchor_28_266" id="FNanchor_28_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_266" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Thus in ozone and hydrogen peroxide we see examples of very
unstable, easily decomposable (by time, spontaneously, and on contact)
substances, full of the energy necessary for change,<a name="FNanchor_28_BIS_267" id="FNanchor_28_BIS_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_BIS_267" class="fnanchor">[28 bis]</a> capable of being
easily reconstituted (in this case decomposing with the evolution of
heat); they are therefore examples of <i>unstable chemical equilibria</i>. If
a substance exists, it signifies that it already presents a certain form
of equilibrium between those elements of which it is built up. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
chemical, like mechanical, equilibria exhibit different degrees of stability
or solidity.<a name="FNanchor_29_268" id="FNanchor_29_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_268" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Besides this, hydrogen peroxide presents another side of the
subject which is not less important, and is much clearer and more
general.</p>

<p>Hydrogen unites with oxygen in two degrees of oxidation: water
or hydrogen oxide, and oxygenated water or hydrogen peroxide; for a
given quantity of hydrogen, the peroxide contains twice as much oxygen
as does water. This is a fresh example confirming the correctness of
the law of multiple proportions, to which we have already referred in
speaking of the water of crystallisation of salts. We can now formulate
this law&mdash;<i>the law of multiple proportions</i>. <i>If two substances A and
B (either simple or compound), unite together to form several compounds,
A<sub>n</sub>B<sub>m</sub>, A<sub>q</sub>B<sub>r</sub> ..., then having expressed the compositions of all these
compounds in such a way that the quantity (by weight or volume) of one
of the component parts will be a constant quantity</i> A, <i>it will be observed
that in all the compounds</i> AB<sub>a</sub>, AB<sub>b</sub> <i>... the quantities of the other
component part,</i> B, <i>will always be in commensurable relation: generally
in simple multiple proportion&mdash;that is, that a : b ..., or m&#8260;n is to r&#8260;q
as whole numbers, for instance as 2 : 3 or 3 : 4....</i></p>

<p>The analysis of water shows that in 100 parts by weight it contains
11·112 parts by weight of hydrogen and 88·888 of oxygen, and the
analysis of peroxide of hydrogen shows that it contains 94·112 parts of
oxygen to 5·888 parts of hydrogen. In this the analysis is expressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
as analyses generally are, in percentages; that is, it gives the amounts
of the elements in a hundred parts by weight of the substance. The
direct comparison of the percentage compositions of water and hydrogen
peroxide does not give any simple relation. But such a relation is
immediately apparent if we calculate the composition of water and of
hydrogen peroxide, having taken either the quantity of oxygen or the
quantity of hydrogen as a constant quantity&mdash;for instance, as unity.
The most simple proportions show that in water there are contained
eight parts of oxygen to one part of hydrogen, and in hydrogen peroxide
sixteen parts of oxygen to one part of hydrogen; or one-eighth part of
hydrogen in water and one-sixteenth part of hydrogen in hydrogen
peroxide to one part of oxygen. Naturally, the analysis does not give
these figures with absolute exactness&mdash;it gives them within a certain
degree of error&mdash;but they approximate, as the error diminishes, to that
limit which is here given. The comparison of the quantities of hydrogen
and oxygen in the two substances above named, taking one of the
components as a constant quantity, gives an example of the application
of the law of multiple proportions, because water contains eight parts
and hydrogen peroxide sixteen parts of oxygen to one part of hydrogen,
and these figures are commensurable and are in the simple proportion of
1 : 2.</p>

<p>An exactly similar multiple proportion is observed in the composition
of all other well-investigated definite chemical compounds,<a name="FNanchor_30_269" id="FNanchor_30_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_269" class="fnanchor">[30]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
and therefore the law of multiple proportions is accepted in chemistry
as the starting point from which other considerations proceed.</p>

<p>The law of multiple proportions was discovered at the beginning
of this century by John Dalton, of Manchester, in investigating the
compounds of carbon with hydrogen. It appeared that two gaseous
compounds of these substances&mdash;marsh gas, CH<sub>4</sub>, and olefiant gas,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, contain for one and the same quantity of hydrogen, quantities
of carbon which stand in multiple proportion; namely, marsh gas
contains relatively half as much carbon as olefiant gas. Although the
analysis of that time was not exact, still the accuracy of this law,
recognised by Dalton, was further confirmed by more accurate investigations.
On establishing the law of multiple proportions, Dalton gave
a hypothetical explanation for it. This explanation is based on the
atomic theory of matter. In fact, the law of multiple proportions may
be very easily understood by admitting the atomic structure of matter.</p>

<p>The essence of the atomic theory is that matter is supposed to consist
of an agglomeration of small and indivisible parts&mdash;atoms&mdash;which
do not fill up the whole space occupied by a substance, but stand apart
from each other, as the sun, planets, and stars do not fill up the whole
space of the universe, but are at a distance from each other. The form
and properties of substances are determined by the position of their
atoms in space and by their state of motion, whilst the reactions accomplished
by substances are understood as redistributions of the
relative positions of atoms and changes in their motion. The atomic
representation of matter arose in very ancient times,<a name="FNanchor_31_270" id="FNanchor_31_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_270" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and up to recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
times was at variance with the dynamical hypothesis, which considers
matter as only a manifestation of forces. At the present time, however,
the majority of scientific men uphold the atomic hypothesis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
although the present conception of an atom is quite different from that
of the ancient philosophers. An atom at the present day is regarded
rather as an individual or unit which is indivisible by physical<a name="FNanchor_32_271" id="FNanchor_32_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_271" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and
chemical forces, whilst the atom of the ancients was actually mechanically
and geometrically indivisible. When Dalton (1804) discovered the law
of multiple proportions, he pronounced himself in favour of the atomic
doctrine, because it enables this law to be very easily understood. If
the divisibility of every element has a limit, namely the atom, then the
atoms of elements are the extreme limits of all divisibility, and if they
differ from each other in their nature, the formation of a compound
from elementary matter must consist in the aggregation of several
different atoms into one whole or system of atoms, now termed
<i>particles or molecules</i>. As atoms can only combine in their entire
masses, it is evident that not only the law of definite composition, but
also that of multiple proportions, must apply to the combination of
atoms with one another; for one atom of a substance can combine
with one, two, or three atoms of another substance, or in general one,
two, three atoms of one substance are able to combine with one, two,
or three atoms of another; this being the essence of the law of
multiple proportions. Chemical and physical data are very well explained
by the aid of the atomic theory. The displacement of one
element by another follows the law of equivalency. In this case one
or several atoms of a given element take the place of one or several
atoms of another element in its compounds. The atoms of different
substances can be mixed together in the same sense as sand can be
mixed with clay. They do not unite into one whole&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> there is not
a perfect blending in the one or other case, but only a juxtaposition, a
homogeneous whole being formed from individual parts. This is the
first and most simple method of applying the atomic theory to the explanation
of chemical phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_33_272" id="FNanchor_33_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_272" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a><br /><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a><br /><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>A certain number of atoms <i>n</i> of an element A in combining with
several atoms <i>m</i> of another element B give a compound A<sub><i>n</i></sub> B<sub><i>m</i></sub>, each
molecule of which will contain the atoms of the elements A and B in
this ratio, and therefore the compound will present a <i>definite composition</i>,
expressed by the formula A<sub><i>n</i></sub>B<sub><i>m</i></sub>, where A and B are the weights of the
atoms and <i>n</i> and <i>m</i> their relative number. If the same elements A
and B, in addition to A<sub><i>n</i></sub>B<sub><i>m</i></sub>, also yield another compound A<sub><i>r</i></sub>B<sub><i>q</i></sub>, then
by expressing the composition of the first compound by A<sub><i>nr</i></sub>B<sub><i>mr</i></sub> (and this
is the same composition as A<sub><i>n</i></sub>B<sub><i>m</i></sub>), and of the second compound by
A<sub><i>rn</i></sub>B<sub><i>qn</i></sub>, we have the law of multiple proportions, because for a given
quantity of the first element, A<sub><i>rn</i></sub>, there occur quantities of the second
element bearing the same ratio to each other as <i>mr</i> is to <i>qn</i>; and
as <i>m</i>, <i>r</i>, <i>q</i>, and <i>n</i> are whole numbers, their products are also whole
numbers, and this is expressed by the law of multiple proportion.
Consequently the atomic theory is in accordance with and evokes the
first laws of definite chemical compounds: the law of definite composition
and the law of multiple proportions.</p>

<p>So, also, is the relation of the atomic theory to the third law of definite
chemical compounds, the <i>law of reciprocal combining weights</i>,
which is as follows:&mdash;If a certain weight of a substance C combine
with a weight <i>a</i> of a substance A, and with a weight <i>b</i> of a substance
B, then, also, the substances A and B will combine together in quantities
<i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (or in multiples of them). This should be the case from
the conception of atoms. Let A, B, and C be the weights of the atoms
of the three substances, and for simplicity of reasoning suppose that
combination takes place between single atoms. It is evident that if
the substance gives AC and BC, then the substances A and B will
give a compound AB, or their multiple, A<sub><i>n</i></sub>B<sub><i>m</i></sub>. And so it is in reality
in nature.</p>

<p>Sulphur combines with hydrogen and with oxygen. Sulphuretted
hydrogen contains thirty-two parts by weight of sulphur to two parts
by weight of hydrogen; this is expressed by the formula H<sub>2</sub>S. Sulphur
dioxide, SO<sub>2</sub>, contains thirty-two parts of sulphur and thirty-two
parts of oxygen, and therefore we conclude, from the law of combining
weights, that oxygen and hydrogen will combine in the proportion of
two parts of hydrogen and thirty-two parts of oxygen, or multiple
numbers of them. And we have seen this to be the case. Hydrogen
peroxide contains thirty-two parts of oxygen, and water sixteen parts,
to two parts of hydrogen; and so it is in all other cases. This consequence
of the atomic theory is in accordance with nature, with the
results of analysis, and is one of the most important laws of chemistry.
It is a law, because it indicates the <i>relation between</i> the weights of
substances entering into chemical combination. Further, it is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
eminently exact law, and not an approximate one. The law of combining
weights is a law of nature, and by no means an hypothesis, for
even if the entire theory of atoms be refuted, still the laws of multiple
proportions and of combining weights will remain, inasmuch as they
deal with facts. They may be guessed at from the sense of the atomic
theory, and historically the law of combining weights is intimately
connected with this theory; but they are not identical, but only
connected, with it. The law of combining weights is formulated with
great ease, and is an immediate consequence of the atomic theory;
without it, it is even difficult to understand. Data for its evolution
existed previously, but it was not formulated until those data were interpreted
by the atomic theory, an hypothesis which up to the present
time has contradicted neither experiment nor fact, and is useful and
of general application. Such is the nature of hypotheses. They are
indispensable to science; they bestow an order and simplicity which
are difficultly attainable without their aid. The whole history of
science is a proof of this. And therefore it may be truly said that it
is better to hold to an hypothesis which may afterwards prove untrue
than to have none at all. Hypotheses facilitate scientific work and
render it consistent. In the search for truth, like the plough of the
husbandman, they help forward the work of the labourer.</p>

conceiving the molecules of ozone (see later) as more complex than those of oxygen, and
ozone as containing a greater quantity of heat than oxygen, has been proved experimentally
by the researches of Mailfert (1880), who showed that the passage of a silent
discharge through a litre of oxygen at 0° may form up to 14 milligrams of ozone, and at
-30° up to 60 milligrams; but best of all in the determinations of Chappuis and Hautefeuille
(1880), who found that at a temperature of -25° a silent discharge converted 20
p.c. of oxygen into ozone, whilst at 20° it was impossible to obtain more than 12 p.c., and
at 100° less than 2 p.c. of ozone was obtained.</p></div>

the electrophorus machines of Holtz and Teploff, &amp;c., Leyden jars, Ruhmkorff coils, or

air or oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_236" id="Footnote_3_236"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_236"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> A silent discharge is such a combination of opposite statical (potential) electricities
as takes place (generally between large surfaces) regularly, without sparks, slowly, and
quietly (as in the dispersion of electricity). The discharge is only luminous in the dark;
there is no observable rise of temperature, and therefore a larger amount of ozone is
formed. But, nevertheless, on continuing the passage of a silent discharge through
ozone it is destroyed. For the action to be observable a large surface is necessary, and
consequently a source of electricity at a high potential. For this reason the silent discharge
is best produced by a Ruhmkorff coil, as the most convenient means of obtaining
a considerable potential of statical electricity with the employment of the comparatively
feeble current of a galvanic battery.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_237" id="Footnote_4_237"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_237"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> <i>v. Babo's apparatus</i> was one of the first constructed for ozonising oxygen by means
of a silent discharge (and it is still one of the best). It is composed of a number (twenty
and more) of long, thin capillary glass tubes closed at one end. A platinum wire, extending
along their whole length, is introduced into the other end of each tube, and this
end is then fused up round the wire, the end of which protrudes outside the tube.
The protruding ends of the wires are arranged alternately in two sides in such a manner
that on one side there are ten closed ends and ten wires. A bunch of such tubes (forty
should make a bunch of not more than 1 c.m. diameter) is placed in a glass tube, and
the ends of the wires are connected with two conductors, and are fused to the ends of the
surrounding tube. The discharge of a Ruhmkorff coil is passed through these ends of
the wires, and the dry air or oxygen to be ozonised is passed through the tube. If
oxygen be passed through, ozone is obtained in large quantities, and free from oxides of
nitrogen, which are partially formed when air is acted on. At low temperatures ozone is
formed in large quantities. As ozone acts on corks and india-rubber, the apparatus
should be made entirely of glass. With a powerful Ruhmkorff coil and forty tubes the
ozonation is so powerful that the gas when passed through a solution of iodide of potassium
not only sets the iodine free, but even oxidises it to potassium iodate, so that in
five minutes the gas-conducting tube is choked up with crystals of the insoluble iodate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_238" id="Footnote_5_238"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_238"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> In order to connect the ozoniser with any other apparatus it is impossible to make
use of india-rubber, mercury, or cements, &amp;c., because they are themselves acted on by,
and act on, ozone. All connections must, as was first proposed by Brodie, be hermetically
closed by sulphuric acid, which is not acted on by ozone. Thus, a cork is passed over
the vertical end of a tube, over which a wide tube passes so that the end of the first tube
protrudes above the cork; mercury is first poured over the cork (to prevent its being
acted on by the sulphuric acid), and then sulphuric acid is poured over the mercury.
The protruding end of the first tube is covered by the lower end of a third tube immersed
in the sulphuric acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_239" id="Footnote_6_239"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_239"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> The method above described is the only one which has been well investigated. The
admixture of nitrogen, or even of hydrogen, and especially of silicon fluoride, appears to
aid the formation and preservation of ozone. Amongst other methods for preparing
ozone we may mention the following: 1. In the action of oxygen on phosphorus at the
ordinary temperature a portion of the oxygen is converted into ozone. At the ordinary
temperature a stick of phosphorus, partially immersed in water and partially in air in a
large glass vessel, causes the air to acquire the odour of ozone. It must further be
remarked that if the air be left for long in contact with the phosphorus, or without the
presence of water, the ozone formed is destroyed by the phosphorus. 2. By the action
of sulphuric acid on peroxide of barium. If the latter be covered with strong sulphuric
acid (the acid, if diluted with only one-tenth of water, does not give ozone), then at a low
temperature the oxygen evolved contains ozone, and in much greater quantities than
in that ozone is obtained by the action of electric sparks or phosphorus. 3. Ozone may
also be obtained by decomposing strong sulphuric acid by potassium manganate especially
with the addition of barium peroxide.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_240" id="Footnote_7_240"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_240"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Ozone takes up the hydrogen from hydrochloric acid; chlorine is liberated, and can
dissolve gold. Iodine is directly oxidised by ozone, but not by oxygen. Ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>,
is oxidised by ozone into ammonium nitrite (and nitrate), 2NH<sub>3</sub> + O<sub>3</sub> = NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O,
and therefore a drop of ammonia, on falling into the gas, gives a thick cloud of
the salts formed. Ozone converts lead oxide into peroxide, and suboxide of thallium
(which is colourless) into oxide (which is brown), so that this reaction is made use of for
detecting the presence of ozone. Lead sulphide, PbS (black), is converted into sulphate,
PbSO<sub>4</sub> (colourless), by ozone. A neutral solution of manganese sulphate gives a
precipitate of manganese peroxide, and an acid solution may be oxidised into permanganic
acid, HMnO<sub>4</sub>. With respect to the oxidising action of ozone on organic substances,
it may be mentioned that with ether, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O, ozone gives ethyl peroxide, which
is capable of decomposing with explosion (according to Berthelot), and is decomposed by
water into alcohol, 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, and hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_241" id="Footnote_8_241"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_241"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> This reaction is the one usually made use of for detecting the presence of ozone.
In the majority of cases paper is soaked in solutions of potassium iodide and starch.
Such <i>ozonometrical</i> or iodised starch-paper when damp turns blue in the presence of
ozone, and the tint obtained varies considerably, according to the length of time it is
exposed and to the amount of ozone present. The amount of ozone in a given gas may
even to a certain degree he judged by the shade of colour acquired by the paper, if preliminary
tests be made.</p>

<p>Test-paper for ozone is prepared in the following manner:&mdash;One gram of neutral
potassium iodide is dissolved in 100 grams of distilled water; 10 grams of starch are
then shaken up in the solution, and the mixture is boiled until the starch is converted
into a jelly. This jelly is then smeared over blotting-paper and left to dry. It must
always he remembered, however, that the colour of iodised starch-paper is changed not
only by the action of ozone, but of many other oxidisers; for example, by the oxides of
nitrogen (especially N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and hydrogen peroxide. Houzeau proposed soaking common
litmus-paper with a solution of potassium iodide, which in the presence of iodine would
turn blue, owing to the formation of KHO. In order to determine if the blue colour is
not produced by an alkali (ammonia) in the gas, a portion of the paper is not soaked in
the potassium iodide, but moistened with water; this portion will then also turn blue if
ammonia be present. A reagent for distinguishing ozone from hydrogen peroxide with
certainty is not known, and therefore these substances in very small quantities (for instance,
in the atmosphere) may easily he confounded. Until recent years the mistake
has frequently been made of ascribing the alteration of iodised starch-paper in the air
to the presence of ozone; at the present time there is reason to believe that it is most
often due to the presence of nitrous acid (Ilosva, 1889).</p></div>

as aqueous vapour is composed of two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen,
which on combining condense into two volumes of aqueous vapour, so also two volumes
of oxygen are combined in ozone with one volume of oxygen to give two volumes of
ozone. In the action of ozone on different substances it is only that additional portion
of its molecule by which it differs from ordinary oxygen that combines with other bodies,
and that is why, under these circumstances, the volume of the ozonised oxygen does not
change. Starting with two volumes of ozone, one-third of its weight is parted with,
and two volumes of oxygen remain.</p>

<p>The above observations of Soret on the capacity of turpentine for dissolving ozone,
together with Schönbein's researches on the formation of ozone in the oxidation of turpentine
and of similar volatile vegetable oils (entering into the composition of <i>perfumes</i>),
also explain the action of this ethereal oil on a great many substances. It is known that
turpentine oil, when mixed with many substances, promotes their oxidation. In this
case it probably not only itself promotes the formation of ozone, but also dissolves ozone
from the atmosphere, and thus acquires the property of oxidising many substances. It
bleaches linen and cork, decolorises indigo, promotes the oxidation and hardening of
boiled linseed oil, &amp;c. These properties of turpentine oil are made use of in practice.
Dirty linen and many stained materials are easily cleaned by turpentine, not only because
it dissolves the grease, but also because it oxidises it. The admixture of turpentine with
drying (boiled) oil, oil-colours, and lacs aids their rapid drying because it attracts ozone.
Various oils occurring in plants, and entering into the composition of perfumes and
certain scent extracts, also act as oxidisers. They act in the same manner as oil of turpentine
and oil of cinnamon. This perhaps explains the refreshing influence they have
in scents and other similar preparations, and also the salubrity of the air of pine forests.
Water upon which a layer of turpentine oil has been poured acquires, when left standing
in the light, the disinfecting and oxidising properties in general of ozonised turpentine
(is this due to the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>?).</p></div>

of such bodies, passed air through a 40 per cent. solution of caustic soda, and then
through a 20 per cent. solution of sulphuric acid (these solutions do not destroy ozone),
and tested the air thus purified for the presence of ozone. As no ozone was then

every oxidation in water or in the presence of aqueous vapour. According to Struve,
hydrogen peroxide is contained in snow and in rain-water, and its formation, together
with ozone and ammonium nitrate, is even probable in the processes of respiration and
combustion. A solution of tin in mercury, or liquid tin amalgam, when shaken up in
water containing sulphuric acid, produces hydrogen peroxide, whilst iron under the
same circumstances does not give rise to its formation. The presence of small quantities
of hydrogen peroxide in these and similar cases is recognised by many reactions.
Amongst them, its action on <i>chromic acid</i> in the presence of ether is very characteristic.
Hydrogen peroxide converts the chromic acid into a higher oxide, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, which is of a
dark-blue colour and dissolves in ether. This ethereal solution is to a certain degree
stable, and therefore the presence of hydrogen peroxide may be recognised by mixing
the liquid to be tested with ether and adding several drops of a solution of chromic acid.
On shaking the mixture the ether dissolves the higher oxide of chromium which is
formed, and acquires a blue colour. The formation of hydrogen peroxide in the combustion
and oxidation of substances containing or evolving hydrogen must be understood in
the light of the conception, to be considered later, of molecules occupying equal volumes
in a gaseous state. At the moment of its evolution a molecule H<sub>2</sub> combines with a molecule
O<sub>2</sub>, and gives H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. As this substance is unstable, a large proportion of it is
decomposed, a small amount only remaining unchanged. If it is obtained, water is easily
formed from it; this reaction evolves heat, and the reverse action is not very probable.
Direct determinations show that the reaction H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O + O evolves 22,000 heat units.
From this it will be understood how easy is the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, as
well as the fact that a number of substances which are not directly oxidised by oxygen
are oxidised by hydrogen peroxide and by ozone, which also evolves heat on decomposition.
Such a representation of the origin of hydrogen peroxide has been developed by
me since 1870. Recently (1890) Traube has pronounced a similar opinion, stating that
Zn under the action of water and air gives, besides ZnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, also H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_254" id="Footnote_19_254"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_254"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The formation of hydrogen peroxide from barium peroxide by a method of double
decomposition is an instance of a number of <i>indirect methods of preparation</i>. A substance
A does not combine with <span class="smcap">B</span>, but <span class="smcap">A B</span> is obtained from <span class="smcap">A C</span> in its action on <span class="smcap">B D</span> (see
Introduction) when <span class="smcap">C D</span> is formed. Water does not combine with oxygen, but as a hydrate
of acids it acts on the compound of oxygen with barium oxide, because this oxide gives a
salt with an acid anhydride; or, what is the same thing, hydrogen with oxygen does not
directly form hydrogen peroxide, but when combined with a haloid (for example, chlorine),
under the action of barium peroxide, BaO<sub>2</sub>, it leads to the formation of a salt of barium
and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It is to be remarked that the passage of barium oxide, BaO, into the peroxide,
BaO<sub>2</sub>, is accompanied by the <i>evolution</i> of 12,100 heat units per 16 parts of oxygen by
weight combined, and the passage of H<sub>2</sub>O into the peroxide H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> does not proceed
directly, because it would be accompanied by the <i>absorption</i> of 22,000 units of heat by
16 parts by weight of oxygen combined. Barium peroxide, in acting on an acid, evidently
evolves less heat than the oxide, and it is this difference of heat that is absorbed in the
hydrogen peroxide. Its energy is obtained from that evolved in the formation of the
salt of barium.</p></div>

this purpose it is dissolved in a dilute solution of nitric acid. A certain quantity of an
insoluble residue always remains, from which the solution is separated by filtration.
The solution will contain not only the compound of the barium peroxide, but also a
compound of the barium oxide itself, a certain quantity of which always remains uncombined
with oxygen. The acid compounds of the peroxide and oxide of barium are easily
distinguishable by their stability. The peroxide gives an unstable compound, and the
oxide a stable salt. By adding an aqueous solution of barium oxide to the resultant
solution, the whole of the peroxide contained in the solution may be precipitated as a
pure aqueous compound (Kouriloff, 1889, obtained the same result by adding an excess
of BaO<sub>2</sub>). The first portions of the precipitate will consist of impurities&mdash;for instance,
oxide of iron. The barium peroxide then separates out, and is collected on a filter
and washed; it forms a substance having a definite composition, BaO<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O, and is very
pure. Pure hydrogen peroxide should always be prepared from such purified barium
peroxide.</p></div>

with a certain amount of water it gives oxygen (see Note  <a href="#Footnote_6_239">6</a>), and hydrogen peroxide is
only obtained by the action of very weak sulphuric acid. Hydrochloric, hydrofluoric,
carbonic, and hydrosilicofluoric acids, and others, when diluted with water also give
hydrogen peroxide with barium peroxide. Professor Schöne, who very carefully investigated
hydrogen peroxide, showed that it is formed by the action of many of the above-mentioned
acids on barium peroxide. In preparing peroxide of hydrogen by means of
sulphuric acid, the solution must be kept cold. A solution of maximum concentration
may be obtained by successive treatments with sulphuric acid of increasing strength.
In this manner a solution containing 2 to 3 grams of pure peroxide in 100 c.c. of water
may be obtained (V. Kouriloff).</p></div>

thus, for instance, by employing hydrochloric acid, hydrogen peroxide and barium chloride
remain in solution. Complicated processes would be required to obtain pure hydrogen
peroxide from such a solution. It is much more convenient to take advantage of the
action of carbonic anhydride on the pure hydrate of barium peroxide. For this purpose
the hydrate is stirred up in water, and a rapid stream of carbonic anhydride is passed
through the water. Barium carbonate, insoluble in water, is formed, and the hydrogen
peroxide remains in solution, so that it may be separated from the carbonate by filtering
only. On a large scale hydrofluosilicic acid is employed, its barium salt being also
insoluble in water.</p></div>

a low temperature, when the water crystallises out&mdash;that is, is converted into ice&mdash;whilst
the hydrogen peroxide remains in solution, as it only freezes at very low temperatures.
It must be observed that hydrogen peroxide, in a strong solution in a pure state, is
exceedingly unstable even at the ordinary temperature, and therefore it must be preserved
in vessels always kept cold, as otherwise it evolves oxygen and forms water.</p></div>

have been subjected to exact explanation, which shows the participation of a substance
present in the process of a reaction, whilst, however, it does not alter the series of changes
proceeding from mechanical actions only. Professor Schöne, of the Petroffsky Academy,
has already explained a number of reactions of hydrogen peroxide which previously were
not understood. Thus, for instance, he showed that with hydrogen peroxide, alkalis give
peroxides of the alkaline metals, which combine with the remaining hydrogen peroxide,
forming unstable compounds which are easily decomposed, and therefore alkalis evince a
decomposing (catalytic) influence on solutions of hydrogen peroxide. Only acid solutions
of hydrogen peroxide, and then only dilute ones, can be preserved well.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_263" id="Footnote_26_263"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_263"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> <i>Hydrogen peroxide</i>, as a substance containing much oxygen (namely, 16 parts to
one part by weight of hydrogen), exhibits many <i>oxidising reactions</i>. Thus, it oxidises
arsenic, converts lime into calcium peroxide, the oxides of zinc and copper into peroxides;
it parts with its oxygen to many sulphides, converting them into sulphates, &amp;c. So, for
example, it converts black lead sulphide, PbS, into white lead sulphate, PbSO<sub>4</sub>, copper
sulphide into copper sulphate, and so on. The restoration of old oil paintings by hydrogen
peroxide is based on this action. Oil colours are usually admixed with white lead, and in
many cases the colour of oil-paints becomes darker in process of time. This is partly
due to the sulphuretted hydrogen contained in the air, which acts on white lead,
forming lead sulphide, which is black. The intermixture of the black colour darkens the
rest. In cleaning a picture with a solution of hydrogen peroxide, the black lead sulphide
is converted into white sulphate, and the colours brighten owing to the disappearance
of the black substance which previously darkened them. Hydrogen peroxide oxidises
with particular energy substances containing hydrogen and capable of easily parting
with it to oxidising substances. Thus it decomposes hydriodic acid, setting the iodine
free and converting the hydrogen it contains into water; it also decomposes sulphuretted
hydrogen in exactly the same manner, setting the sulphur free. Starch paste with
potassium iodide is not, however, directly coloured by peroxide of hydrogen in the entire
absence of free acids; but the addition of a small quantity of iron sulphate (green vitriol)
or of lead acetate to the mixture is enough to entirely blacken the paste. This is a very
sensitive reagent (test) for peroxide of hydrogen, like the test with chromic acid and
ether (<i>see</i> Note  <a href="#Footnote_8_241">8</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_264" id="Footnote_27_264"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_264"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> To explain the phenomenon, an hypothesis has been put forward by Brodie, Clausius,
and Schönbein which supposes ordinary oxygen to be an electrically neutral substance,
composed, so to speak, of two electrically opposite kinds of oxygen&mdash;positive and negative.
It is supposed that hydrogen peroxide contains one kind of such polar oxygen,
whilst in the oxides of the above-named metals the oxygen is of opposite polarity. It is
supposed that in the oxides of the metals the oxygen is electro-negative, and in hydrogen
peroxide electro-positive, and that on the mutual contact of these substances ordinary
neutral oxygen is evolved as a consequence of the mutual attraction of the oxygens of
opposite polarity. Brodie admits the polarity of oxygen in combination, but not in an
uncombined state, whilst Schönbein supposes uncombined oxygen to be polar also, considering
ozone as electro-negative oxygen. The supposition that the oxygen of ozone is
different from that of hydrogen peroxide is contradicted by the fact that in acting on barium
peroxide strong sulphuric acid forms ozone, and dilute acid forms hydrogen peroxide.</p></div>

H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, adding soda to it, and then extracting the peroxide of hydrogen from the mixture
by shaking it with ether, obtained a 50 per cent. solution of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which, although
perfectly free from other acids, gave a distinctly acid reaction with litmus. And here
attention should first of all be turned to the fact that the peroxides of the metals correspond
to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, like salts to an acid, for instance, Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and BaO<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. Furthermore, it
must be remembered that O is an analogue of S (Chapters XV. and XX.), and sulphur
gives H<sub>2</sub>S, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. And sulphurous acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, is unstable as a hydrate,
and gives water and the anhydride SO<sub>2</sub>. If the sulphur be replaced by oxygen, then
instead of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>, we have H<sub>2</sub>OO<sub>3</sub> and OO<sub>2</sub>. The latter is ozone, while the salt
K<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (peroxide of potassium) corresponds to the hydrate H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> as to an acid. And
between H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> there may exist intermediate acid compounds, the first of which
would be H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in which, from analogy to the sulphur compounds, one would expect acid
properties. Besides which we may mention that for sulphur, besides H<sub>2</sub>S (which is a
feeble acid), H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>S<sub>5</sub> are known. Thus in many respects H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> offers points of
resemblance to acid compounds, and as regards its qualitative (reactive) analogies, it not
only resembles Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BaO<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., but also persulphuric acid HSO<sub>4</sub> (to which the anhydride
S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> corresponds) and Cu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, &amp;c., which will be subsequently described.</p></div>

it is in unstable equilibrium. If the centre of gravity lies below the point of support;
the state of equilibrium is very stable, and a vibration may take place about this position
of stable equilibrium, as in a pendulum or balance, when finally the body assumes
a position of stable equilibrium. But if, keeping to the same mechanical example,
the body be supported not on a point, in the geometrical sense of the word, but on a
small plane, then the state of unstable equilibrium may be preserved, unless destroyed
by external influences. Thus a man stands upright supported on the plane, or several
points of the surfaces of his feet, having the centre of gravity above the points of support.
Vibration is then possible, but it is limited, otherwise on passing outside the limit of
possible equilibrium another more stable position is attained about which vibration
becomes more possible. A prism immersed in water may have several more or less stable
positions of equilibrium. The same is also true with the atoms in molecules. Some
molecules present a state of more stable equilibrium than others. Hence from this simple
comparison it will be at once evident that the stability of molecules may vary considerably,
that one and the same elements, taken in the same number, may give isomerides of different
stability, and, lastly, that there may exist states of equilibria which are so unstable,
so ephemeral, that they will only arise under particularly special conditions&mdash;such, for
example, as certain hydrates mentioned in the first chapter (<i>see</i> Notes  <a href="#Footnote_57_104">57</a>,  <a href="#Footnote_67_115">67</a>, and others).
And if in one case the instability of a given state of equilibrium is expressed by its
instability with a change of temperature or physical state, then in other cases it is
expressed by the facility with which it decomposes under the influence of contact or of
the chemical influence of other substances.</p></div>

of multiple proportions. For a given quantity of the non-metal or metal the quantities
of oxygen in the different degrees of oxidation will stand as 1 : 2, or as 1 : 3, or as 2 : 3,
or as 2 : 7, and so on. Thus, for instance, copper combines with oxygen in at least two
proportions, forming the oxides found in nature, and called the suboxide and the oxide
of copper, Cu<sub>2</sub>O and CuO; the oxide contains twice as much oxygen as the suboxide.
Lead also presents two degrees of oxidation, the oxide and peroxide, and in the latter
there is twice as much oxygen as in the former, PbO and PbO<sub>2</sub>. When a base and an
acid are capable of forming several kinds of salts, normal, acid, basic, and anhydro-, it is
found that they also clearly exemplify the law of multiple proportions. This was demonstrated
by Wollaston soon after the discovery of the law in question. We saw in the
<a href="#Page_40">first chapter</a> that salts show different degrees of combination with water of crystallisation,
and that they obey the law of multiple proportions. And, more than this, the indefinite
chemical compounds existing as solutions may, as we saw in the same chapter, be brought
under the law of multiple proportions by the hypothesis that solutions are unstable
hydrates formed according to the law of multiple proportions, but occurring in a state of
dissociation. By means of this hypothesis the law of multiple proportions becomes still
more general, and all the aspects of chemical compounds are subject to it. The direction
of the whole contemporary state of chemistry was determined by the discoveries of
Lavoisier and Dalton. By endeavouring to prove that in solutions we have nothing else
than the liquid products of the dissociation of definite hydrates, it is my aim to bring also
this category of indefinite compounds under the general principle enunciated by Dalton;
just as astronomers have discovered a proof and not a negation of the laws of Newton in
perturbations.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_270" id="Footnote_31_270"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_270"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Leucippus, Democritus, and especially Lucretius, in the classical ages, represented
matter as made up of atoms&mdash;that is, of parts incapable of further division. The
geometrical impossibility of such an admission, as well as the conclusions which were
deduced by the ancient atomists from their fundamental propositions, prevented other
philosophers from following them, and the atomic doctrine, like very many others, lived,
without being ratified by fact, in the imaginations of its followers. Between the present
atomic theory and the doctrine of the above-named ancient philosophers there is
naturally a remote historical connection, as between the doctrine of Pythagoras and
Copernicus, but they are essentially different. For us the atom is indivisible, not in the
geometrical abstract sense, but only in a physical and chemical sense. It would be better
to call the atoms indivisible <i>individuals</i>. The Greek atom = the Latin individual, both
according to the etymology and original sense of the words, but in course of time these two
words have acquired a different meaning. The individual is mechanically and geometrically
divisible, and only indivisible in a special sense. The earth, the sun, a man or a fly are
individuals, although geometrically divisible. Thus the &lsquo;atoms&rsquo; of contemporary science,
indivisible in a chemical sense, form those units with which we are concerned in the investigation
of the natural phenomena of matter, just as a man is an indivisible unit in
the investigation of social relations, or as the stars, planets, and luminaries serve as units in
astronomy. The formation of the vortex hypothesis, in which, as we shall afterwards see,
atoms are entire whirls mechanically complex, although physico-chemically indivisible,
clearly shows that the scientific men of our time in holding to the atomic theory have
only borrowed the word and form of expression from the ancient philosophers, and not the
essence of their atomic doctrine. It is erroneous to imagine that the contemporary conceptions
of the atomists are nothing but the repetition of the metaphysical reasonings
of the ancients. To show the true meaning of the atomism of the ancient philosophers, and
the profound difference between their points of argument and those of contemporary
men of science, I cite the following fundamental propositions of Democritus (<span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 470&ndash;380)
as the best expounder of the atomic doctrine of the ancients:&mdash;(1) Nothing can
proceed from nothing, nothing that exists can disappear or be destroyed (and hence
matter), and every change only consists of a combination or separation. (2) Nothing is
accidental, there is a reason and necessity for everything. (3) All except atoms and
vacua is reason and not existence. (4) The atoms, which are infinite in number and
form, constitute the visible universe by their motion, impact, and consequent revolving
motion. (5) The variety of objects depends only upon a difference in the
number, form, and order of the atoms of which they are formed, and not upon a qualitative
difference of their atoms, which only act upon each other by pressure and impact.
(6) The spirit, like fire, consists of minute, spherical, smooth, and very mobile and all-penetrating
atoms, whose motion forms the phenomenon of life. These Democritian,
chiefly metaphysical, principles of atomism are so essentially different from the principles
of the present atomic doctrine, which is exclusively applied to explaining the phenomena
of the external world, that it may be useful to mention the essence of the
atomic propositions of Boscovitch, a Slav who lived in the middle of the eighteenth
century, and who is regarded as the founder of the modern atomic doctrines which,
however, did not take hold upon the minds of scientific men, and were rarely applied
prior to Dalton&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> until the beginning of the nineteenth century. The doctrine of
Boscovitch was enunciated by him in 1758&ndash;1764 in his &lsquo;<i>Philosophiæ naturalis theoria
reducta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium</i>.&rsquo; Boscovitch considers
matter to be composed of atoms, and the atoms to be the points or centres of forces (just
as the stars and planets may be considered as points of space), acting between bodies and
their parts. These forces vary with the distance, so that beyond a certain very small
distance all atoms, and hence also their aggregates, are attracted according to Newton's
law, but at less distances, there alternate wave-like spheres of gradually decreasing
attraction and increasing (as the distance decreases) repulsion, until at last at a minimum
distance only the repellent action remains. Atoms, therefore, cannot merge into each
other. Consequently, the atoms are held at a certain distance from each other, and
therefore occupy space. Boscovitch compares the sphere of repulsion surrounding the
atoms to the spheres of action of firing of a detachment of soldiers. According
to his doctrine, atoms are indestructible, do not merge into each other, have mass,
are everlasting and mobile under the action of the forces proper to them. Maxwell
rightly calls this hypothesis the &lsquo;extreme&rsquo; among those existing to explain matter, but
many aspects of Boscovitch's doctrine repeat themselves in the views of our day, with
this essential difference, that instead of a mathematical point furnished with the properties
of mass, the atoms are endowed with a corporality, just as the stars and planets
are corporal, although in certain aspects of their interaction they may be regarded
as mathematical points. In my opinion, the atomism of our day must first of all
be regarded merely as a convenient method for the investigation of ponderable
matter. As a geometrician in reasoning about curves represents them as formed of a
succession of right lines, because such a method enables him to analyse the subject
under investigation, so the scientific man applies the atomic theory as a method of
analysing the phenomena of nature. Naturally there are people now, as in ancient
times, and as there always will be, who apply reality to imagination, and therefore
there are to be found atomists of extreme views; but it is not in their spirit that we
should acknowledge the great services rendered by the atomic doctrine to all science,
which, while it has been essentially independently developed, is, if it be desired to
reduce all ideas to the doctrines of the ancients, a union of the ancient dynamical and
atomic doctrines.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_271" id="Footnote_32_271"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_271"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> Dalton and many of his successors distinguished the atoms of elements and compounds,
in which they clearly symbolised the difference of their opinion from the representations
of the ancients. Now only the individuals of the elements, indivisible by
physical and chemical forces, are termed atoms, and the individuals of compounds indivisible
under physical changes are termed molecules; these are divisible into atoms by
chemical forces.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_272" id="Footnote_33_272"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_272"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> In the present condition of science, either the atomic or the dynamical hypothesis
is inevitably obliged to admit the existence of an invisible and imperceptible motion in
matter, without which it is impossible to understand either light or heat, or gaseous
pressure, or any of the mechanical, physical, or chemical phenomena. The ancients
saw vital motion in animals only, but to us the smallest particle of matter, endued with
<i>vis viva</i>, or energy in some degree or other, is incomprehensible without self-existent
motion. Thus motion has become a conception inseparably knit with the conception
of matter, and this has prepared the ground for the revival of the dynamical hypothesis
of the constitution of matter. In the atomic theory there has arisen that generalising
idea by which the world of atoms is constructed, like the universe of heavenly bodies,
with its suns, planets, and meteors, endued with everlasting force of motion, forming
molecules as the heavenly bodies form systems, like the solar system, which molecules
are only relatively indivisible in the same way as the planets of the solar system are
inseparable, and stable and lasting as the solar system is lasting. Such a representation,
without necessitating the absolute indivisibility of atoms, expresses all that science
can require for an hypothetical representation of the constitution of matter. In closer
proximity to the dynamical hypothesis of the constitution of matter is the oft-times
revived <i>vortex hypothesis</i>. Descartes first endeavoured to raise it; Helmholtz and
Thomson (Lord Kelvin) gave it a fuller and more modern form; many scientific men
applied it to physics and chemistry. The idea of vortex rings serves as the starting
point of this hypothesis; these are familiar to all as the rings of tobacco smoke, and
may be artificially obtained by giving a sharp blow to the sides of a cardboard box
having a circular orifice and filled with smoke. Phosphuretted hydrogen, as we shall
see later on, when bubbling from water always gives very perfect vortex rings in a still
atmosphere. In such rings it is easy to observe a constant circular motion about their
axes, and to notice the stability the rings possess in their motion of translation. This
unchangeable mass, endued with a rapid internal motion, is likened to the atom. In a
medium deprived of friction, such a ring, as is shown by theoretical considerations of the
subject from a mechanical point of view, would be perpetual and unchangeable. The rings
are capable of grouping together, and in combining, without being absolutely indivisible,
remain indivisible. The vortex hypothesis has been established in our times, but it has
not been fully developed; its application to chemical phenomena is not clear, although
not impossible; it does not satisfy a doubt in respect to the nature of the space existing
between the rings (just as it is not clear what exists between atoms, and between the
planets), neither does it tell us what is the nature of the moving substance of the ring,
and therefore for the present it only presents the germ of an hypothetical conception of
the constitution of matter; consequently, I consider that it would be superfluous to
speak of it in greater detail. However, the thoughts of investigators are now (and
naturally will be in the future), as they were in the time of Dalton, often turned to the
question of the limitation of the mechanical division of matter, and the atomists have
searched for an answer in the most diverse spheres of nature. I select one of the
methods attempted, which does not in any way refer to chemistry, in order to show how
closely all the provinces of natural science are bound together. Wollaston proposed the
investigation of the <i>atmosphere of the heavenly bodies</i> as a means for confirming the
existence of atoms. If the divisibility of matter be infinite, then air must extend
throughout the entire space of the heavens as it extends all over the earth by its elasticity
and diffusion. If the infinite divisibility of matter be admitted, it is impossible that any
portion of the whole space of the universe can be entirely void of the component parts of
our atmosphere. But if matter be divisible up to a certain limit only&mdash;namely, up to the
atom&mdash;then there <i>can exist</i> a heavenly body void of an atmosphere; and if such a body
be discovered, it would serve as an important factor for the acceptation of the validity of
the atomic doctrine. The moon has long been considered as such a luminary and this
circumstance, especially from its proximity to the earth, has been cited as the best proof
of the validity of the atomic doctrine. This proof is apparently (Poisson) deprived of
some of its force from the possibility of the transformation of the component parts of
our atmosphere into a solid or liquid state at immense heights above the earth's surface,
where the temperature is exceedingly low; but a series of researches (Pouillet) has shown
that the temperature of the heavenly space is comparatively not so very low, and is
attainable by experimental means, so that at the low existing pressure the liquefaction
of the gases of the atmosphere cannot he expected even on the moon. Therefore the
absence of an atmosphere about the moon, if it were not subject to doubt, would be
counted as a forcible proof of the atomic theory. As a proof of the absence of a lunar
atmosphere, it is cited that the moon, in its independent motion between the stars, when
eclipsing a star&mdash;that is, when passing between the eye and the star&mdash;does not show any
signs of refraction at its edge; the image of the star does not alter its position in the
heavens on approaching the moon's surface, consequently there is no atmosphere on the
moon's surface capable of refracting the rays of light. Such is the conclusion by which
the absence of a lunar atmosphere is acknowledged. But this conclusion is most feeble,
and there are even facts in exact contradiction to it, by which the existence of a lunar
atmosphere may be proved. The entire surface of the moon is covered with a number of
mountains, having in the majority of cases the conical form natural to volcanoes. The
volcanic character of the lunar mountains was confirmed in October 1866, when a change
was observed in the form of one of them (the crater Linnea). These mountains must
be on the edge of the lunar disc. Seen in profile, they screen one another and interfere
with observations on the surface of the moon, so that when looking at the edge of
the lunar disc we are obliged to make our observations not on the moon's surface, but
at the summits of the lunar mountains. These mountains are higher than those on
our earth, and consequently at their summits the lunar atmosphere must he exceedingly
rarefied even if it possess an observable density at the surface. Knowing the mass of
the moon to be eighty-two times less than the mass of the earth, we are able to determine
approximately that our atmosphere at the moon's surface would be about twenty-eight
times lighter than it is on the earth, and consequently at the very surface of the
moon the refraction of light by the lunar atmosphere must he very slight, and at the
heights of the lunar mountains it must be imperceptible, and would be lost within the
limits of experimental error. Therefore the absence of refraction of light at the edge of
the moon's disc cannot yet be urged in favour of the absence of a lunar atmosphere.
There is even a series of observations obliging us to admit the existence of this atmosphere.
These researches are due to Sir John Herschel. This is what he writes: &lsquo;It has
often been remarked that during the eclipse of a star by the moon there occurs a peculiar
optical illusion; it seems as if the star before disappearing passed over the edge of the
moon and is seen through the lunar disc, sometimes for a rather long period of time. I
myself have observed this phenomenon, and it has been witnessed by perfectly trustworthy
observers. I ascribe it to optical illusion, but it must be admitted that the star
might have been seen on the lunar disc through some deep ravine on the moon.&rsquo; Geniller,
in Belgium (1856), following the opinion of Cassini, Eiler, and others, gave an explanation
of this phenomenon: he considers it due to the refraction of light in the valleys of
the lunar mountains which occur on the edge of the lunar disc. In fact, although these
valleys do not probably present the form of straight ravines, yet it may sometimes
happen that the light of a star is so refracted that its image might he seen, notwithstanding
the absence of a direct path for the light-rays. He then goes on to remark
that the density of the lunar atmosphere must be variable in different parts, owing to
the very long nights on the moon. On the dark, or non-illuminated portion, owing to
these long nights, which last thirteen of our days and nights, there must be excessive cold,
and hence a denser atmosphere, while, on the contrary, on the illuminated portion the
atmosphere must be much more rarefied. This variation in the temperature of the
different parts of the moon's surface explains also the absence of clouds, notwithstanding
the possible presence of air and aqueous vapour, on the visible portion of the moon. The
presence of an atmosphere round the sun and planets, judging from astronomical observations,
may be considered as fully proved. On Jupiter and Mars even bands of clouds
may be distinguished. Thus the atomic doctrine, admitting a finite mechanical divisibility
only, must he, as yet at least, only accepted as a means, similar to that means
which a mathematician employs when he breaks up a continuous curvilinear line into a
number of straight lines. There is a simplicity of representation in atoms, but there is
no absolute necessity to have recourse to them. The conception of the individuality of
the parts of matter exhibited in chemical elements only is necessary and trustworthy.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">NITROGEN AND AIR</span></h2>

<p>Gaseous <i>nitrogen</i> forms about four-fifths (by volume) of the atmosphere;
consequently the air contains an exceedingly large mass of it.
Whilst entering in so considerable a quantity into the composition of
air, nitrogen does not seem to play any active part in the atmosphere,
the chemical action of which is mainly dependent on the oxygen it contains.
But this is not an entirely correct idea, because animal life
cannot exist in pure oxygen, in which animals pass into an abnormal
state and die; and the nitrogen of the air, although slowly, forms
diverse compounds, many of which play a most important part in
nature, especially in the life of organisms. However, neither plants<a name="FNanchor_1_273" id="FNanchor_1_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_273" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
nor animals directly absorb the nitrogen of the air, but take it up
from already prepared nitrogenous compounds; further, plants are
nourished by the nitrogenous substances contained in the soil and
water, and animals by the nitrogenous substances contained in plants
and in other animals. Atmospheric electricity is capable of aiding the
passage of gaseous nitrogen into nitrogenous compounds, as we shall
afterwards see, and the resultant substances are carried to the soil
by rain, where they serve for the nourishment of plants. Plentiful
harvests, fine crops of hay, vigorous growth of trees&mdash;other conditions
being equal&mdash;are only obtained when the soil contains <i>ready prepared
nitrogenous compounds</i>, consisting either of those which occur in air
and water, or of the residues of the decomposition of other plants or
animals (as in manure). The nitrogenous substances contained in
animals have their origin in those substances which are formed in
plants. Thus the nitrogen of the atmosphere is the origin of all the
nitrogenous substances occurring in animals and plants, although not
directly so, but after first combining with the other elements of air.</p>

<p>The nitrogenous compounds which enter into the composition of plants
and animals are of primary importance; no vegetable or animal cell&mdash;that
is, the elementary form of organism&mdash;exists without containing a nitrogenous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
substance, and moreover organic life manifests itself primarily
in these nitrogenous substances. The germs, seeds, and those parts by
which cells multiply themselves abound in nitrogenous substances; the
sum total of the phenomena which are proper to organisms depend
primarily on the chemical properties of the nitrogenous substances which
enter into their composition. It will be sufficient, for instance, to point
out the fact that vegetable and animal organisms, clearly distinguishable
as such, are characterised by a different degree of energy in their
nature, and at the same time by a difference in the amount of nitrogenous
substances they contain. In plants, which compared with
animals possess but little activity, being incapable of independent
movement, &amp;c., the amount of nitrogen is very much less than
in animals, whose tissues are almost exclusively formed of nitrogenous
substances. It is remarkable that the nitrogenous parts of
plants, chiefly of the lower orders, sometimes present both forms and
properties which approach to those of animal organisms; for example,
the zoospores of sea-weeds, or those parts by means of which the latter
multiply themselves. These zoospores on leaving the sea-weed in many
respects resemble the lower orders of animal life, having, like the latter,
the property of moving. They also approach the animal kingdom in
their composition, their outer coating containing nitrogenous matter.
Directly the zoospore becomes covered with that non-nitrogenous or
cellular coating which is proper to all the ordinary cells of plants, it
loses all resemblance to an animal organism and becomes a small plant.
It may be thought from this that the cause of the difference in the
vital processes of animals and plants is the different amount of nitrogenous
substances they contain. The nitrogenous substances which occur
in plants and animals appertain to a series of exceedingly complex
and very changeable chemical compounds; their elementary composition
alone shows this; besides nitrogen, they contain carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen, and sulphur. Being distinguished by a very great instability
under many conditions in which other compounds remain unchanged,
these substances are fitted for those perpetual changes which form the
first condition of vital activity. These complex and changeable nitrogenous
substances of the organism are called <i>proteïd substances</i>. The
white of eggs is a familiar example of such a substance. They are also
contained in the flesh of animals, the curdy elements of milk, the
glutinous matter of wheaten flour, or so-called gluten, which forms the
chief component of macaroni, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Nitrogen occurs in the earth's crust, in compounds either forming
the remains of plants and animals, or derived from the nitrogen of the
atmosphere as a consequence of its combination with the other component<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
parts of the air. It is not found in other forms in the earth's
crust; so that nitrogen must be considered, in contradistinction to
oxygen, as an element which is purely superficial, and does not extend
to the depths of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_1_BIS_274" id="FNanchor_1_BIS_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_BIS_274" class="fnanchor">[1 bis]</a></p>

<p><i>Nitrogen is liberated</i> in a free state in the decomposition of the
<i>nitrogenous organic substances</i> entering into the composition of
organisms&mdash;for instance, on their combustion. All organic substances
burn when heated to redness with oxygen (or substances readily yielding
it, such as oxide of copper); the oxygen combines with the carbon,
sulphur, and hydrogen, and the nitrogen is evolved in a free state,
because at a high temperature it does not form any stable compound,
but remains uncombined. Carbonic anhydride and water are formed
from the carbon and hydrogen respectively, and therefore to obtain pure
nitrogen it is necessary to remove the carbonic anhydride from the
gaseous products obtained. This may be done very easily by the action
of alkalis&mdash;for instance, caustic soda. The amount of nitrogen in
organic substances is determined by a method founded on this.</p>

<p>It is also very easy to obtain <i>nitrogen from air</i>, because oxygen
combines with many substances. Either phosphorus or metallic copper
is usually employed for removing the oxygen from air, but, naturally,
a number of other substances may also be used. If a small saucer on
which a piece of phosphorus is laid be placed on a cork floating on
water, and the phosphorus be lighted, and the whole covered with a
glass bell jar, then the air under the jar will be deprived of its oxygen,
and nitrogen only will remain, owing to which, on cooling, the water
will rise to a certain extent in the bell jar. The same object (procuring
nitrogen from air) is attained much more conveniently and perfectly
by passing air through a red-hot tube containing copper filings. At a
red heat, metallic copper combines with oxygen and gives a black
powder of copper oxide. If the layer of copper be sufficiently long and
the current of air slow, all the oxygen will be absorbed, and nitrogen
alone will pass from the tube.<a name="FNanchor_2_275" id="FNanchor_2_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_275" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Nitrogen may also be procured from many of its <i>compounds with
oxygen</i><a name="FNanchor_3_276" id="FNanchor_3_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_276" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <i>and hydrogen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_277" id="FNanchor_4_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_277" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> but the best fitted for this purpose is a saline
mixture containing, on the one hand, a compound of nitrogen with
oxygen, termed nitrous anhydride, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and on the other hand,
ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, a compound of nitrogen with hydrogen. By
heating such a mixture, the oxygen of the nitrous anhydride combines
with the hydrogen of the ammonia, forming water, and gaseous nitrogen
is evolved, 2NH<sub>3</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 3H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>4</sub>. Nitrogen is procured by
this method in the following manner:&mdash;A solution of caustic potash is
saturated with nitrous anhydride, by which means potassium nitrite is
formed. On the other hand, a solution of hydrochloric acid saturated
with ammonia is prepared; a saline substance called sal-ammoniac,
NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, is thus formed in the solution. The two solutions thus prepared
are mixed together and heated. Reaction takes place according
to the equation KNO<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>4</sub>Cl = KCl + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>. This reaction
proceeds in virtue of the fact that potassium nitrite and ammonium
chloride are salts which, on interchanging their metals, give potassium
chloride and ammonium nitrite, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>, which breaks up into water
and nitrogen. This reaction does not take place without the aid of
heat, but it proceeds very easily at a moderate temperature. Of the
resultant substances, the nitrogen only is gaseous. Pure nitrogen may
be obtained by drying the resultant gas and passing it through a solution
of sulphuric acid (to absorb a certain quantity of ammonia which
is evolved in the reaction).<a name="FNanchor_4_BIS_278" id="FNanchor_4_BIS_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_BIS_278" class="fnanchor">[4 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Nitrogen is a gaseous substance which does not differ much in
physical properties from air; its density, referred to hydrogen, is
approximately equal to 14&mdash;that is, it is slightly lighter than air, its
density referred to air being 0·972; one litre of nitrogen weighs 1·257
gram. Nitrogen mixed with oxygen, which is slightly heavier than
air, forms air. It is a gas which, like oxygen and hydrogen, is
liquefied with difficulty, and is but little soluble in water and other
liquids. Its absolute boiling point<a name="FNanchor_5_279" id="FNanchor_5_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_279" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> is about -140°; above this
temperature it is not liquefiable by pressure, and at lower temperatures
it remains a gas at a pressure of 50 atmospheres. Liquid
nitrogen boils at -193°, so that it may be employed as a source of
great cold. At about -203°, in vaporising under a decrease of pressure,
nitrogen solidifies into a colourless snow-like mass. Nitrogen
does not burn,<a name="FNanchor_5_BIS_280" id="FNanchor_5_BIS_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_BIS_280" class="fnanchor">[5 bis]</a> does not support combustion, is not absorbed by any
of the reagents used in gas analysis, at least at the ordinary temperature&mdash;in
a word, it presents a whole series of negative chemical
properties; this is expressed by saying that this element has no energy
for combination. Although it is capable of forming compounds both
with oxygen and hydrogen as well as with carbon, yet these compounds
are only formed under particular circumstances, to which we
will directly turn our attention. At a red heat nitrogen combines
with boron, titanium, and silicon, barium, magnesium, &amp;c., forming
very stable nitrogenous compounds,<a name="FNanchor_6_281" id="FNanchor_6_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_281" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> whose properties are entirely
different from those of nitrogen with hydrogen, oxygen and carbon.
However, the combination of nitrogen with carbon, although it does
not take place directly between the elements at a red heat, yet proceeds
with comparative ease by heating a mixture of charcoal with an
alkaline carbonate, especially potassium carbonate or barium carbonate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
to redness, carbo-nitrides or cyanides of the metals being formed; for
instance, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 4C + N<sub>2</sub> = 2KCN + 3CO.<a name="FNanchor_7_282" id="FNanchor_7_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_282" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Nitrogen is found with oxygen in the air, but they do not readily
combine. Cavendish, however, in the last century, showed that
<i>nitrogen combines with oxygen under the influence of a series of electric
sparks</i>. Electric sparks in passing through a moist<a name="FNanchor_8_283" id="FNanchor_8_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_283" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> mixture of nitrogen
and oxygen cause these elements to combine, forming reddish-brown
fumes of oxides of nitrogen,<a name="FNanchor_9_284" id="FNanchor_9_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_284" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> which form nitric acid,<a name="FNanchor_10_285" id="FNanchor_10_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_285" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> NHO<sub>3</sub>.
The presence of the latter is easily recognised, not only from its
reddening litmus paper, but also from its acting as a powerful oxidiser
even of mercury. Conditions similar to these occur in nature, during a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
thunderstorm or in other electrical discharges which take place in the
atmosphere; whence it may be taken for granted that air and rain-water
always contain traces of nitric and nitrous acids.<a name="FNanchor_11_286" id="FNanchor_11_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_286" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Besides which
Crookes (1892) showed that under certain circumstances and when
electricity of high potential<a name="FNanchor_11_BIS_287" id="FNanchor_11_BIS_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_287" class="fnanchor">[11 bis]</a> passes through the air, the combination
of nitrogen with oxygen is accompanied by the formation of
a true flame. This was also observed previously (1880) during the
passage of electrical discharges through the air.</p>

<p>Further observations showed that under the influence of electrical
discharges,<a name="FNanchor_12_288" id="FNanchor_12_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_288" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> silent as well as with sparks, nitrogen is able to enter into
many reactions with hydrogen and with many hydrocarbons; although
these reactions cannot be effected by exposure to a red heat. Thus,
for instance, a series of electric sparks passed through a mixture of
nitrogen and hydrogen causes them to combine and <i>form ammonia</i><a name="FNanchor_13_289" id="FNanchor_13_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_289" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
or nitrogen hydride, NH<sub>3</sub>, composed of one volume of nitrogen and
three volumes of hydrogen. This combination is limited to the formation
of 6 per cent. of ammonia, because ammonia is decomposed,
although not entirely

(<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">94</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">100</span>
</span>)

by electric sparks. This signifies that under
the influence of an electrical discharge the reaction NH<sub>3</sub> = N + 3H
is reversible, consequently it is a dissociation, and in it a state of
equilibrium is arrived at. The equilibrium may be destroyed by the
addition of gaseous hydrochloric acid, HCl, because with ammonia it
forms a solid saline compound, sal-ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which (being
formed from a gaseous mixture of 3H, N, and HCl) fixes the ammonia.
The remaining mass of nitrogen and hydrogen, under the action of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
sparks, again forms ammonia, and in this manner <i>solid sal-ammoniac
is obtained to the end by the action of a series of electric sparks on a
mixture of gaseous</i> N, H<sub>3</sub>, <i>and</i> HCl.<a name="FNanchor_14_290" id="FNanchor_14_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_290" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Berthelot (1876) showed that
under the action of a silent discharge many non-nitrogenous organic
substances (benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, cellulose in the form of paper, resin,
glucose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and others) absorb nitrogen and form complex
nitrogenous compounds, which are capable, like albuminous substances,
of evolving their nitrogen as ammonia when heated with
alkalis.<a name="FNanchor_15_291" id="FNanchor_15_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_291" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>By such indirect methods does the gaseous nitrogen of the atmosphere
yield its primary compounds, in which form it enters into
plants, and is elaborated in them into complex albuminous substances.<a name="FNanchor_15_BIS_292" id="FNanchor_15_BIS_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_BIS_292" class="fnanchor">[15 bis]</a>
But, starting from a given compound of nitrogen with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
hydrogen or oxygen, we may, without the aid of organisms, obtain, as
will afterwards be partially indicated, most diverse and complex
nitrogenous substances, which cannot by any means be formed directly
from gaseous nitrogen. In this we see an example not only of the
difference between an element in the free state and an intrinsic element,
but also of those circuitous or <i>indirect methods</i> by which substances
are formed in nature. The discovery, prognostication, and, in general,
the study of such indirect methods of the preparation and formation of
substances forms one of the existing problems of chemistry. From the
fact that A does not act at all on B, it must not be concluded that a
compound AB is not to be formed. The substances A and B contain
atoms which occur in AB, but their state or the nature of their motion
may not be at all that which is required for the formation of AB,
and in this substance the chemical state of the elements may be as
different as the state of the atoms of oxygen in ozone and in water.
Thus free nitrogen is inactive; but in its compounds it very easily
enters into changes and is distinguished by great activity. An acquaintance
with the compounds of nitrogen confirms this. But, before
entering on this subject, let us consider air as a mass containing free
nitrogen.</p>

<p>Judging from what has been already stated, it will be evident that
<i>atmospheric air</i><a name="FNanchor_16_293" id="FNanchor_16_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_293" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> contains a mixture of several gases and vapours.
Some of them are met with in it in nearly constant proportions, whilst
others, on the contrary, are very variable in their amount. The chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
component parts of air, placed in the order of their relative amounts,
are the following: nitrogen,<a name="FNanchor_16_BIS_294" id="FNanchor_16_BIS_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_BIS_294" class="fnanchor">[16 bis]</a> oxygen, aqueous vapour, carbonic
anhydride, nitric acid, salts of ammonia, oxides of nitrogen, and also
ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and complex organic nitrogenous substances.
Besides these, air generally contains water, as spray, drops, and snow,
and particles of solids, perhaps of cosmic origin in certain instances,
but in the majority of cases proceeding from the mechanical translation
of solid particles from one locality to another by the wind. These small
solid and liquid particles (having a large surface in proportion to their
weight) are suspended in air as solid matter is suspended in turbid water;
they often settle on the surface of the earth, but the air is never entirely
free from them because they are never in a state of complete rest.
Then, air not unfrequently contains incidental traces of various substances
as everyone knows by experience. These incidental substances
sometimes belong to the order of those which act injuriously, the germs
of lower organisms&mdash;for instance of moulds&mdash;and the class of carriers
of infectious diseases.</p>

<p>In the air of the various countries of the earth, at different longitudes
and at different altitudes above its surface, on the ocean or on the
dry land&mdash;in a word, in the air of most diverse localities of the earth&mdash;the
oxygen and nitrogen are found everywhere to be in a constant ratio.
This is, moreover, self-evident from the fact that the air constantly
diffuses (intermixes by virtue of the internal motion of the gaseous
particles) and is also put into motion and intermixed by the wind, by
which processes it is equalised in its composition over the entire surface
of the earth. In those localities where the air is subject to change,
and is in a more or less enclosed space, or, at any rate, in an unventilated
space, it may alter very considerably in its composition. For this
reason the air in dwellings, cellars, and wells, in which there are
substances absorbing oxygen, contains less of this gas, whilst the air on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the surface of standing water, which abounds in the lower orders of
plant life evolving oxygen, contains an excess of this gas.<a name="FNanchor_17_295" id="FNanchor_17_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_295" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The
constant composition of air over the whole surface of the earth has
been proved by a number of most careful researches.<a name="FNanchor_18_296" id="FNanchor_18_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_296" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><i>The analysis of air</i> is effected by converting the oxygen into a non-gaseous
compound, so as to separate it from the air. The original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
volume of the air is first measured, and then the volume of the remaining
nitrogen. The quantity of oxygen is calculated either from
the difference between these volumes or by the weight of the oxygen
compound formed. All the volumetric measurements have to be
corrected for pressure, temperature, and moisture (Chapters <a href="#Page_40">I</a>. and <a href="#Page_113">II</a>.)
The medium employed for converting the oxygen into a non-gaseous
substance should enable it to be taken up from the nitrogen to the
very end without evolving any gaseous substance. So, for instance,<a name="FNanchor_19_297" id="FNanchor_19_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_297" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
a mixture of pyrogallol, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, with a solution of a caustic alkali
absorbs oxygen with great ease at the ordinary temperature (the
solution turns black), but it is unsuited for accurate analysis because it
requires an aqueous solution of an alkali, and it alters the composition
of the air by acting on it as a solvent.<a name="FNanchor_20_298" id="FNanchor_20_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_298" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> However, for approximate
determinations this simple method gives results which are entirely
satisfactory.</p>

<p>The determinations in a eudiometer (Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>.) give more exact
results, if all the necessary corrections for changes of pressure, temperature,
and moisture be taken into account. This determination is
carried out essentially as follows:&mdash;A certain amount of air is introduced
into the eudiometer, and its volume is determined. About an
equal volume of dry hydrogen is then passed into the eudiometer, and
the volume again determined. The mixture is then exploded, in the
way described for the determination of the composition of water. The
remaining volume of the gaseous mixture is again measured; it will be
less than the second of the previously measured volumes. Out of three
volumes which have disappeared, one belonged to the oxygen and two
to the hydrogen, consequently one-third of the loss of volume indicates
the amount of oxygen contained in the air.<a name="FNanchor_21_299" id="FNanchor_21_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_299" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The most complete method for the analysis of air, and one which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
accompanied by the least amount of error, consists in the direct weighing,
as far as is possible, of the oxygen, nitrogen, water, and carbonic
anhydride contained in it. For this purpose the air is first passed
through an apparatus for retaining the moisture and carbonic anhydride
(which will be considered presently), and is then led through
a tube which contains shavings of metallic copper and has been previously
weighed. A long layer of such copper heated to redness absorbs
all the oxygen from the air, and leaves pure nitrogen, whose weight must
be determined. This is done by collecting it in a weighed and exhausted
globe, while the amount by weight of oxygen is shown by the
increase in weight of the tube with the copper after the experiment.</p>

10&ndash;15 litres. The air is first pumped out of it, and it is weighed empty. The tube T connected
with it is filled with copper, and is weighed empty of air. It is heated in a charcoal furnace.
When the copper has become red-hot, the stopcock <i>r</i> (near R) is slightly opened, and the air
passes through the vessels L, containing a solution of potash, <i>f</i>, containing solutions and pieces
of caustic potash, which remove the carbonic anhydride from the air, and then through <i>o</i> and <i>t</i>,
containing sulphuric acid (which has been previously boiled to expel dissolved air) and pumice-stone,
which removes the moisture from the air. The pure air then gives up its oxygen to the
copper in T. When the air passes into T the stopcock R of the globe B is opened, and it becomes
filled with nitrogen. When the air ceases to flow in, the stopcocks are closed, and the globe B
and tube T weighed. The nitrogen is then pumped out of the tube and it is weighed again.
The increase in weight of the tube shows the amount of oxygen, and the difference of the second
and third weighings of the tube, with the increase in weight of the globe, gives the weight of
the nitrogen.</p></div>

<p>Air free from moisture and carbonic anhydride<a name="FNanchor_22_300" id="FNanchor_22_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_300" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> contains 20·95 to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>

therefore be 20·92 ± 0·05 per cent. Taking the density of air = 1 and
of oxygen = 1·105 and nitrogen 0·972 the composition of air by weight
will be 23·12 per cent. of oxygen and 76·88 per cent. of nitrogen.<a name="FNanchor_24_302" id="FNanchor_24_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_302" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The possibility of the composition of air being altered by the mere
action of a solvent very clearly shows that the component parts of air
are in a state of mixture, in which any gases may occur; they do not
in this case form a definite compound, although the composition of the
atmosphere does appear constant under ordinary conditions. The fact
that its composition varies under different conditions confirms the
truth of this conclusion, and therefore the constancy of the composition
of air must not be considered as in any way dependent on the nature
of the gases entering into its composition, but only as proceeding from
cosmic phenomena co-operating towards this constancy. It must be
admitted, therefore, that the processes evolving oxygen, and chiefly the
processes of the respiration of plants, are of equal force with those
processes which absorb oxygen over the entire surface of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_25_303" id="FNanchor_25_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_303" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Air always contains more or less moisture<a name="FNanchor_26_304" id="FNanchor_26_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_304" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and <i>carbonic anhydride</i>
produced by the respiration of animals and the combustion of carbon
and carboniferous compounds. The latter shows the properties of an
acid anhydride. In order to determine the amount of carbonic anhydride
in air, substances are employed which absorb it&mdash;namely, alkalis
either in solution or solid. A solution of caustic potash, KHO, is
poured into light glass vessels, through
which the air is passed, and the amount of
carbonic anhydride is determined by the
increase in weight of the vessel. But it
is best to take a solid porous alkaline
mass such as soda-lime.<a name="FNanchor_27_305" id="FNanchor_27_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_305" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> With a slow
current of air a layer of soda-lime 20 cm.
in length is sufficient to completely deprive
1 cubic metre of air of the carbonic anhydride
it contains. A series of tubes containing
calcium chloride for absorbing the
moisture<a name="FNanchor_28_306" id="FNanchor_28_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_306" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> is placed before the apparatus
for the absorption of the carbonic anhydride,
and a measured mass of air is
passed through the whole apparatus by means of an aspirator. In
this manner the determination of the moisture is combined with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
absorption of the carbonic anhydride. The arrangement shown in
fig. <a href="#fig_38">38</a> is such a combination.</p>

<p>The amount of carbonic anhydride<a name="FNanchor_29_307" id="FNanchor_29_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_307" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> in free air is incomparably
more constant than the amount of moisture. The average amount
in 100 volumes of dry air is approximately 0·03 volume&mdash;that is,
10,000 volumes of air contain about three volumes of carbonic anhydride,
most frequently about 2·95 volumes. As the specific gravity of
carbonic anhydride referred to air = 1·52, it follows that 100 parts by
weight of air contain 0·045 part by weight of carbonic anhydride.
This quantity varies according to the time of year (more in winter),
the altitude above the level of the sea (less at high altitudes), the
proximity to forests and fields (less) or cities (greater), &amp;c. But the
variation is small and rarely exceeds the limits of 2&frac12; to 4 ten-thousandths
by volume.<a name="FNanchor_30_308" id="FNanchor_30_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_308" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> As there are many natural local influences which either
increase the amount of carbonic anhydride in the air (respiration, combustion,
decomposition, volcanic eruptions, &amp;c.), or diminish it (absorption
by plants and water), the reason of the great constancy in the
amount of this gas in the air must be looked for, in the first place, in the
fact that the wind mixes the air of various localities together, and, in
the second place, in the fact that the waters of the ocean, holding carbonic
acid in solution,<a name="FNanchor_31_309" id="FNanchor_31_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_309" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> form an immense reservoir for regulating the
amount of this gas in the atmosphere. Immediately the partial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
pressure of the carbonic anhydride in the air decreases, the water
evolves it, and when the partial pressure increases, it absorbs it, and
thus nature supplies the conditions for a natural state of moving
equilibrium in this as in so many other instances.<a name="FNanchor_32_310" id="FNanchor_32_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_310" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Besides nitrogen, oxygen, moisture, and carbonic acid, all the other
substances occurring in air are found in infinitesimally small quantities
by weight, and therefore the <i>weight of a cubic measure of air</i> depends,
to a sensible degree, on the above-named components alone. We have
already mentioned that at 0° and 760 mm. pressure the weight of a
cubic litre of air is 1·293 gram. This weight varies with the acceleration
of gravity, <i>g</i>, so that if <i>g</i> be expressed in metres the weight of a
litre of air, <i>e</i> = <i>g</i> × 0·131844 gram. For St. Petersburg <i>g</i> is about
9·8188, and therefore <i>e</i> is about 1·2946,<a name="FNanchor_33_311" id="FNanchor_33_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_311" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the air being understood to be
dry and free from carbonic anhydride. Taking the amount of the
latter as 0·03 per 100 volumes, we obtain a greater weight; for example,
for St. Petersburg <i>e</i> = 1·2948 instead of 1·2946 gram. The weight
of one litre of moist air in which the tension<a name="FNanchor_34_312" id="FNanchor_34_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_312" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> of the aqueous
vapour (partial pressure) = <i>f</i> mm., at a pressure (total) of air of H<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
millimetres, at a temperature <i>t</i>, will be (<i>i.e.</i>, if at 0° and 760 mm. the
weight of dry air = <i>e</i>) equal to

<span class="fdn">760</span>
</span>. For instance,
if H = 730 mm., <i>t</i> = 20°, and <i>f</i> = 10 mm. (the moisture is then
slightly below 60 p.c.), the weight of a litre of air at St. Petersburg
= 1·1527 gram.<a name="FNanchor_35_313" id="FNanchor_35_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_313" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>The presence of ammonia, a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen,
in the air, is indicated by the fact that all acids exposed to the air absorb
ammonia from it after a time. De Saussure observed that
aluminium sulphate is converted by air into a double sulphate of ammonium
and aluminium, or the so-called ammonia alum. Quantitative
determinations have shown that the amount of ammonia<a name="FNanchor_36_314" id="FNanchor_36_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_314" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> contained
in air varies at different periods. However, it may be accepted that
100 cubic metres of air do not contain less than 1 or more than 5
milligrams of ammonia. It is remarkable that mountain air contains
more ammonia than the air of valleys. The air in those places where
animal substances undergoing change are accumulated, and especially
that of stables, generally contains a much greater quantity of this gas.
This is the reason of the peculiar pungent smell noticed in such places.
Moreover ammonia, as we shall learn in the following chapter, combines
with acids, and should therefore be found in air in the form of
such combinations, since air contains carbonic and nitric acids.</p>

<p>The presence of nitric acid in air is proved without doubt by the
fact that rain-water contains an appreciable amount of it.</p>

<p>Further (as already mentioned in Chapter <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>.), air contains ozone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and hydrogen peroxide and nitrous acid (and its ammonia salt), <i>i.e.</i>
substances having a direct oxidising action (for instance, upon iodized
starch-paper), but they are present in very small quantities.<a name="FNanchor_37_315" id="FNanchor_37_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_315" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>Besides substances in a gaseous or vaporous state,<a name="FNanchor_38_316" id="FNanchor_38_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_316" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> there is always
found a more or less considerable quantity of substances which are not
known in a state of vapour. These substances are present in the air as
<i>dust</i>. If a linen surface, moistened with an acid, be placed in perfectly
pure air, then the washings are found to contain sodium, calcium, iron,
and potassium.<a name="FNanchor_39_317" id="FNanchor_39_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_317" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Linen moistened with an alkali absorbs carbonic,
sulphuric, phosphoric, and hydrochloric acids. Further, the presence
of organic substances in air has been proved by a similar experiment.
If a glass globe be filled with ice and placed in a room where are a
number of people, then the presence of organic substances, like albuminous
substances, may be proved in the water which condenses on the
surface of the globe. It may be that the miasmas causing infection in
marshy localities, hospitals, and in certain epidemic illnesses proceed
from the presence of such substances in the air (and especially in water,
which contains many micro-organisms), as well as from the presence
of germs of lower organisms in the air as a minute dust. Pasteur
proved the existence of such germs in the air by the following experiment:&mdash;He
placed gun-cotton (pyroxylin), which has the appearance
of ordinary cotton, in a glass tube. Gun-cotton is soluble in a mixture
of ether and alcohol, forming the so-called collodion. A current of air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
was passed through the tube for a long period of time, and the gun-cotton
was then dissolved in a mixture of ether and alcohol. An
insoluble residue was thus obtained which actually contained the germs
of organisms, as was shown by microscopical observations, and by their
capacity to develop into organisms (mould, &amp;c.) under favourable
conditions. The presence of these germs determines the property of
air of bringing about the processes of putrefaction and fermentation&mdash;that
is the fundamental alteration of organic substances, which is
accompanied by an entire change in their properties. The appearance
of lower organisms, both vegetable and animal, is always to be remarked
in these processes. Thus, for instance, in the process of fermentation,
when, for example, wine is procured from the sweet juice of grapes, a
sediment separates out which is known under the name of lees, and
contains peculiar yeast organisms. Germs are required before these
organisms can appear.<a name="FNanchor_40_318" id="FNanchor_40_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_318" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> They are floating in the air, and fall into the
sweet fermentable liquid from it. Finding themselves under favourable
conditions, the germs develop into organisms; they are nourished at
the expense of the organic substance, and during growth change and
destroy it, and bring about fermentation and putrefaction. This is
why, for instance, the juice of the grape when contained in the skin of
the fruit, which allows access of the air but is impenetrable to the
germs, does not ferment, does not alter so long as the skin remains
intact. This is also the reason why animal substances when kept from
the access of air may be preserved for a great length of time. Preserved
foods for long sea voyages are kept in this way.<a name="FNanchor_41_319" id="FNanchor_41_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_319" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Hence it is evident
that however infinitesimal the quantity of germs carried in the atmosphere
may be, still they have an immense significance in nature.<a name="FNanchor_42_320" id="FNanchor_42_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_320" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>Thus we see that air contains a great variety of substances. The
nitrogen, which is found in it in the largest quantity, has the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
influence on those processes which are accomplished by the action of
air. The oxygen, which is met with in a lesser quantity than the
nitrogen, on the contrary takes a very important part in a number of
reactions; it supports combustion and respiration, it brings about
decomposition and every process of slow oxidation. The part played
by the moisture of air is well known. The carbonic anhydride, which
is met with in still smaller quantities, has an immense significance in
nature, inasmuch as it serves for the nourishment of plants. The
importance of the ammonia and nitric acid is very great, because they are
the sources of the nitrogenous substances comprising an indispensable
element in all living organisms. And, lastly, the infinitesimal quantity
of germs also have a great significance in a number of processes. Thus
it is not the quantitative but the qualitative relations of the component
parts of the atmosphere which determine its importance in nature.<a name="FNanchor_43_321" id="FNanchor_43_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_321" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Air, being a mixture of various substances, may suffer considerable
<i>changes</i> in consequence of incidental circumstances. It is particularly
necessary to remark those changes in the composition of air which take
place in dwellings and in various localities where human beings have
to remain during a lengthy period of time. The respiration of human
beings and animals alters the air.<a name="FNanchor_44_322" id="FNanchor_44_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_322" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> A similar deterioration of air is
produced by the influence of decomposing organic substances, and
especially of substances burning in it.<a name="FNanchor_45_323" id="FNanchor_45_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_323" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Hence it is necessary to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
regard to the purification of the air of dwellings. The renewal of air,
the replacing of respired by fresh air, is termed &lsquo;ventilation,&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_46_324" id="FNanchor_46_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_324" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
removal of foreign and injurious admixtures from the air is called
&lsquo;disinfection.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_47_325" id="FNanchor_47_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_325" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The accumulation of all kinds of impurities in the
air of dwellings and cities is the reason why the air of mountains,
forests, seas, and non-marshy localities, covered with vegetation or snow,
is distinguished for its freshness, and, in all respects, beneficial action.</p>

mass beyond those which have come there with the remains of organisms, and from the
air with rain-water, must be looked for in two circumstances. In the first place, in the
instability of many nitrogenous compounds, which are liable to break up with the formation
of gaseous nitrogen; and in the second place in the fact that the salts of nitric acid,
forming the product of the action of air on many nitrogenous and especially organic
compounds, are very soluble in water, and on penetrating into the depths of the earth
(with water) give up their oxygen. The result of the changes of the nitrogenous organic
substances which fall into the earth is without doubt frequently, if not invariably, the
formation of gaseous nitrogen. Thus the gas evolved from coal always contains much
nitrogen (together with marsh gas, carbonic anhydride, and other gases).</p></div>

CuO, at the ordinary temperature in the presence of solutions of acids, or, better still, in

of copper in ammonia. Nitrogen is very easily procured by this method. A flask filled
with copper turnings is closed with a cork furnished with a funnel and stopcock. A
solution of ammonia is poured into the funnel, and caused to drop slowly upon the
copper. If at the same time a current of air be slowly passed through the flask (from a

heat to raise the mass to redness; titanium combines so easily with nitrogen that it
is difficult to obtain it free from that element; magnesium easily absorbs nitrogen at a
red heat. It is a remarkable and instructive fact that these compounds of nitrogen are
very stable and non-volatile. Carbon (C = 12) with nitrogen gives cyanogen, C<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, which
is gaseous and very unstable, and whose molecule is not large, whilst boron (B = 11)
forms a nitrogenous compound which is solid, non-volatile, and very stable. Its composition,
BN, is similar to that of cyanogen, but its molecular weight, B<sub>n</sub>N<sub>n</sub>, is
probably greater. Its composition, like that of N<sub>2</sub>Mg<sub>3</sub>, NNa<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>Hg<sub>3</sub> and of many of

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_284" id="Footnote_9_284"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_284"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> If a mixture of one volume of nitrogen and fourteen volumes of hydrogen be burnt,
then water and a considerable quantity of nitric acid are formed. It may be partly due
to this that a certain quantity of nitric acid is produced in the slow oxidation of nitrogenous
substances in an excess of air. This is especially facilitated by the presence of
an alkali with which the nitric acid formed can combine. If a galvanic current be passed
through water containing the nitrogen and oxygen of the air in solution, then the hydrogen
and oxygen set free combine with the nitrogen, forming ammonia and nitric acid.</p>

<p>When copper is oxidised at the expense of the air at the ordinary temperature in the
presence of ammonia, oxygen is absorbed, not only for combination with the copper, but
also for the formation of nitric acid.</p>

<p>The combination of nitrogen with oxygen, even, for example, by the action of electric
sparks, is not accompanied by an explosion or rapid combination, as in the action of a
spark on a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. This is explained by the fact that heat is
not evolved in the combination of nitrogen with oxygen, but is absorbed&mdash;an expenditure
of energy is required, there is no evolution of energy. In fact, there will not be the
transmission of heat from particle to particle which occurs in the explosion of detonating
gas. Each spark will aid the formation of a certain quantity of the compound
of oxygen and nitrogen, but will not excite the same in the neighbouring particles. In
other words, the combination of hydrogen with oxygen is an exothermal reaction, and
the combination of nitrogen with oxygen an endothermal reaction.</p>

<p>A condition particularly favourable for the oxidation of nitrogen is the explosion of
detonating gas and air if the former be <i>in excess</i>. If a mixture of two volumes of
detonating gas and one volume of air be exploded, then one-tenth of the air is converted
into nitric acid, and consequently after the explosion has taken place there remain only
nine-tenths of the volume of air originally taken. If a large proportion of air be taken&mdash;for
instance, four volumes of air to two volumes of detonating gas&mdash;then the temperature
of the explosion is lowered, the volume of air taken remains unchanged, and no
nitric acid is formed. This gives a rule to be observed in making use of the eudiometer&mdash;namely
that to weaken the force of the explosion not less than an equal volume
of air should be added to the explosive mixture. On the other hand a large excess must
not be taken as no explosion would then ensue (<i>see</i> Chapter III. Note  <a href="#Footnote_34_209">34</a>). Probably in
the future means will be found for obtaining compounds of nitrogen on a large industrial
scale by the aid of electric discharges, and by making use of the inexhaustible mass of
nitrogen in the atmosphere.</p></div>

idea that under the influence of an electric discharge gaseous nitrogen changes in its
properties; if not permanently like oxygen (electrolysed oxygen or ozone does not react
on nitrogen, according to Berthelot), it may be temporarily at the moment of the action
of the discharge, just as some substances under the action of heat are permanently
affected (that is, when once changed remain so&mdash;for instance, white phosphorus passes
into red, &amp;c.), whilst others are only temporarily altered (the dissociation of S<sub>6</sub> into S<sub>2</sub>
or of sal-ammoniac into ammonia and hydrochloric acid). Such a proposition is favoured
by the fact that nitrogen gives two kinds of spectra, with which we shall afterwards
become acquainted. It may be that the molecules N<sub>2</sub> then give less complex molecules,
N containing one atom, or form a complex molecule N<sub>3</sub>, like oxygen in passing into
ozone. Probably under a silent discharge the molecules of oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>, are partly decomposed

which fact led him to think that in nature, where the action of electricity takes
place very frequently, a part of the complex nitrogenous substances may proceed from
the gaseous nitrogen of the air by this method.</p>

<p>As the nitrogenous substances of organisms play a very important part in them
(organic life cannot exist without them), and as the nitrogenous substances introduced
into the soil are capable of invigorating its crops (of course in the presence of the
other nourishing principles required by plants), the question of the means of converting
the atmospheric nitrogen into the nitrogenous compounds of the soil, or into <i>assimilable
nitrogen</i> capable of being absorbed by plants and of forming complex (albuminous)
substances in them, is one of great theoretical and practical interest. The artificial
(technical) conversion of the atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogenous compounds, notwithstanding
repeated attempts, cannot yet be considered as fulfilled in a practical
remunerative manner although its possibility is already evident. Electricity will
probably aid in solving this very important practical problem. When the theoretical
side of the question is further advanced, then without doubt an advantageous means
will be found for the manufacture of nitrogenous substances from the nitrogen of the
air; and this is needed, before all, for the agriculturist, to whom nitrogenous fertilisers
form an expensive item, and are more important than all other manures.</p>

<p>One thousand tons of farmyard manure do not generally contain more than four tons
of nitrogen in the form of complex nitrogenous substances, and this amount of nitrogen
is contained in twenty tons of ammonium sulphate, therefore the effect of a mass of
farmyard manure in respect to the introduction of nitrogen may be produced by small
quantities of artificial nitrogenous fertilisers (<i>see</i> Note  <a href="#Footnote_15_BIS_292">15 bis</a>).</p></div>

made in the physiology of plants have proved that the higher forms of plants are not
capable of directly absorbing the nitrogen of the atmosphere and converting it into complex
albuminous substances, still it has been long and repeatedly observed that the amount
of nitrogenous substances in the soil is increased by the cultivation of plants of the
bean (leguminous) family such as pea, acacia, &amp;c. A closer study of these plants has
shown that this is connected with the formation of peculiar nodular swellings in their
roots caused by the growth of peculiar micro-organisms (bacteria) which cohabit the soil
with the roots, and are capable of absorbing nitrogen from the air, <i>i.e.</i> of converting it
into assimilated nitrogen. This branch of plant physiology, which forms another proof
of the important part played by micro-organisms in nature, cannot be discussed in
this work, but it should be mentioned, since it is of great theoretical and practical
interest, and, moreover, phenomena of this kind, which have recently been discovered,
promise to explain, to some extent at least, certain of the complex problems concerning
the development of life on the earth.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_293" id="Footnote_16_293"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_293"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Under the name of atmospheric air the chemist and physicist understand ordinary
air containing nitrogen and oxygen only, notwithstanding that the other component parts
of air have a very important influence on the living matter of the earth's surface. That
air is so represented in science is based on the fact that only the two components above-named
are met with in air in a constant quantity, whilst the others are variable. The
solid impurities may be separated from air required for chemical or physical research
by simple filtration through a long layer of cotton-wool placed in a tube. Organic impurities
are removed by passing the air through a solution of potassium permanganate.
The carbonic anhydride contained in air is absorbed by alkalis&mdash;best of all, soda-lime,
which in a dry state in porous lumps absorbs it with exceeding rapidity and completeness.
Aqueous vapour is removed by passing the air over calcium chloride, strong sulphuric
acid, or phosphoric anhydride. Air thus purified is accepted as containing only
nitrogen and oxygen, although in reality it still contains a certain quantity of hydrogen
and hydrocarbons, from which it may be purified by passing over copper oxide heated to
redness. The copper oxide then oxidises the hydrogen and hydrocarbons&mdash;it burns them,
forming water and carbonic anhydride, which may be removed as above described. When
it is said that in the determination of the density of gases the weight of air is taken as
unity, it is understood to be such air, containing only nitrogen and oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_BIS_294" id="Footnote_16_BIS_294"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_BIS_294"><span class="label">[16 bis]</span></a> Thanks to the remarkable discovery made in the summer of 1894 by Lord Rayleigh
and Prof. Ramsay, the well-known component elements of air must now he supplemented
by 1 p.c. (by volume) of a heavy gas (density about 19, H = 1), inactive like nitrogen,
which was discovered in the researches made by Lord Rayleigh on the density of
nitrogen as mentioned in note  <a href="#Footnote_4_BIS_278">4 bis</a>. Up to the present time this gas has been always
determined together with nitrogen, because it combines with neither the hydrogen in
the eudiometer nor with the copper in the gravimetric method of determining the composition
of air, and therefore has always remained with the nitrogen. It has been
possible to separate it from nitrogen since magnesium absorbs nitrogen at a red heat,
while this gas remains unabsorbed, and was found to have a density nearly one and a
half time greater than that of nitrogen (is it not a polymer of nitrogen, N<sub>3</sub>?). It is now
known also that this gas gives a luminous spectrum, which contains the bright blue line
observed in the spectrum of nitrogen. Owing to the fact that it is an exceedingly inert
substance, even more so than nitrogen, it has been termed Argon. Further reference
will be made to it in the Appendix.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_295" id="Footnote_17_295"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_295"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> As a further proof of the fact that certain circumstances may change the composition
of air, it will be enough to point out that the air contained in the cavities of
glaciers contains only up to 10 p.c. of oxygen. This depends on the fact that at low
temperatures oxygen is much more soluble in snow-water and snow than nitrogen. When
shaken up with water the composition of air should change, because the water dissolves
unequal quantities of oxygen and nitrogen. We have already seen (Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.) that
the air boiled off from water saturated at about 0° contains about thirty-five volumes
of oxygen and sixty-five volumes of nitrogen, and we have considered the reason of
this.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_296" id="Footnote_18_296"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_296"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The analysis of air by weight conducted by Dumas and Boussingault in Paris,
which they repeated many times between April 27 and September 22, 1841, under various
conditions of weather, showed that the amount by weight of oxygen only varies between
22·89 p.c. and 23·08 p.c., the average amount being 23·07 p.c. Brunner, at Bern in
Switzerland, and Bravais, at Faulhorn in the Bernese Alps, at a height of two kilometres
above the level of the sea, Marignac at Geneva, Lewy at Copenhagen, and Stas at
Brussels, have analysed the air by the same methods, and found that its composition
does not exceed the limits determined for Paris. The most recent determinations (with
an accuracy of ±0·05 p.c.) confirm the conclusion that the composition of the atmosphere
is constant.</p>

<p>As there are some grounds (which will be mentioned shortly) for considering that the
composition of the air at great altitudes is slightly different from that at attainable
heights&mdash;namely, that it is richer in the lighter nitrogen&mdash;several fragmentary observations
made at Munich (Jolly, 1880) gave reason for thinking that in the upward currents (that is
in the region of minimum barometric pressure or at the centres of meteorological cyclones)
the air is richer in oxygen than in the descending currents of air (in the regions of anticyclones
or of barometric maxima); but more carefully conducted observations showed
this supposition to be incorrect. Improved methods for the analysis of air have shown
that certain slight variations in its composition do actually occur, but in the first place
they depend on incidental local influences (on the passage of the air over mountains
and large surfaces of water, regions of forest and herbage, and the like), and in the
second place are limited to quantities which are scarcely distinguishable from possible
errors in the analyses. The researches made by Kreisler in Germany (1885) are particularly
convincing.</p>

<p>The considerations which lead to the supposition that the atmosphere at great altitudes
contains less oxygen than at the surface of the earth are based on the law of partial
pressures (Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.) According to this law, the equilibrium of the oxygen in
the strata of the atmosphere is not dependent on the equilibrium of the nitrogen, and
the variation in the densities of both gases with the height is determined by the pressure
of each gas separately. Details of the calculations and considerations here involved
are contained in my work <i>On Barometric Levellings</i>, 1876, p. 48.</p>

<p>On the basis of the law of partial pressure and of hypsometrical formulæ, expressing
the laws of the variation of pressures at different altitudes, the conclusion may be deduced
that at the upper strata of the atmosphere the proportion of the nitrogen with respect
to the oxygen increases, but the increase will not exceed a fraction per cent., even at
altitudes of four and a half to six miles, the greatest height within the reach of men
either by climbing mountains or by means of balloons. This conclusion is confirmed by
the analyses of air collected by Welch in England during his aëronautic ascents.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_297" id="Footnote_19_297"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_297"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> The complete absorption of the oxygen may be attained by introducing moist phosphorus
into a definite volume of air; the occurrence of this is recognised by the fact of
the phosphorus becoming non-luminous in the dark. The amount of oxygen may be
determined by measuring the volume of nitrogen remaining. This method however
cannot give accurate results, owing to a portion of the air being dissolved in the water,
to the combination of some of the nitrogen with oxygen and to the necessity of introducing
and withdrawing the phosphorus, which cannot be accomplished without
introducing bubbles of air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_298" id="Footnote_20_298"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_298"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> For rapid and approximate analyses (technical and hygienic), such a mixture is
very suitable for determining the amount of oxygen in mixtures of gases from which
the substances absorbed by alkalis have first been removed. According to certain observers,

oxygen.</p></div>

quantity of carbonic anhydride, as De Saussure remarked, and air free from moisture,
after being passed over red-hot copper oxide, appears invariably to contain a small
quantity of water, as Boussingault has observed. These observations lead to the
assumption that air always contains a certain quantity of gaseous hydrocarbons, like
marsh gas, which, as we shall afterwards learn, is evolved from the earth, marshes, &amp;c.
Its amount, however, does not exceed a few hundredths per cent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_301" id="Footnote_23_301"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_301"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> The analyses of air are accompanied by errors, and there are variations of composition
attaining hundredths per cent.; the average normal composition of air is therefore

of the balance of oxygen in the entire atmosphere; it may therefore he supposed that the
composition of air will vary from time to time, the relation between vegetation and the
oxygen absorbing processes changes; but as the atmosphere of the earth can hardly
have a definite limit and we have already seen (Chapter IV., Note <a href="#Footnote_33_272">33</a>) that there are
observations confirming this, it follows that our atmosphere should vary in its component
parts with the entire heavenly space, and therefore it must he supposed that
any variation in the composition by weight of the air can only take place exceedingly
slowly, and in a manner imperceptible by experiment.</p></div>

in the study of physics and meteorology and the subject has been mentioned above,
in Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_1_47">1</a>, where the methods of absorbing moisture from gases were pointed
out.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_305" id="Footnote_27_305"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_305"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Soda-lime is prepared in the following manner:&mdash;Unslaked lime is finely powdered
and mixed with a slightly warmed and very strong solution of caustic soda. The mixing
should be done in an iron dish, and the materials should be well stirred together until the
lime begins to slake. When the mass becomes hot, it boils, swells up, and solidifies, forming
a porous mass very rich in alkali and capable of rapidly absorbing carbonic anhydride.
A lump of caustic soda or potash presents a much smaller surface for absorption and therefore
acts much less rapidly. It is necessary to place an apparatus for absorbing water after
the apparatus for absorbing the carbonic anhydride, because the alkali in absorbing the
latter gives off water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_306" id="Footnote_28_306"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_306"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> It is evident that the calcium chloride employed for absorbing the water should be
free from lime or other alkalis in order that it may not retain carbonic anhydride. Such
calcium chloride may be prepared in the following manner: A perfectly neutral solution
of calcium chloride is prepared from lime and hydrochloric acid; it is then carefully
evaporated first on a water-bath and then on a sand-bath. When the solution attains a
certain strength a scum is formed, which solidifies at the surface. This scum is
collected, and will be found to be free from caustic alkalis. It is necessary in any case
to test it before use, as otherwise a large error may be introduced into the results, owing
to the presence of free alkali (lime). It is best to pass carbonic anhydride through the
tube containing the calcium chloride for some time before the experiment, in order to
saturate any free alkali that may remain from the decomposition of a portion of the
calcium chloride by water, CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = CaOH<sub>2</sub>O + 2HCl.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_307" id="Footnote_29_307"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_307"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Recourse is had to special methods when the determination only takes note of the
carbonic anhydride of the air. For instance, it is absorbed by an alkali which does not
contain carbonates (by a solution of baryta or caustic soda mixed with baryta), and then
the carbonic anhydride is expelled by an excess of an acid, and its amount determined by the
volume given off. A rapid method of determining CO<sub>2</sub> (for hygienic purposes) is given
by the fall of tension produced by the introduction of an alkali (the air having been
either brought to dryness or saturated with moisture). Dr. Schidloffsky's apparatus is
based upon this principle. The question as to the amount of carbonic anhydride present
in the air has been submitted to many voluminous and exact researches, especially those
of Reiset, Schloesing, Müntz, and Aubin, who showed that the amount is not subject
to such variations as at first announced on the basis of incomplete and insufficiently
accurate determinations.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_308" id="Footnote_30_308"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_308"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> It is a different case in enclosed spaces, in dwellings, cellars, wells, caves, and mines,
where the renewal of air is impeded. Under these circumstances large quantities of
carbonic anhydride may accumulate. In cities, where there are many conditions for
the evolution of carbonic anhydride (respiration, decomposition, combustion), its
amount is greater than in free air, yet even in still weather the difference does not
often exceed one ten-thousandth (that is, rarely attains 4 instead of 2·9 vols. in 10000
vols. of air).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_309" id="Footnote_31_309"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_309"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> In the sea as well as in fresh water, carbonic acid occurs in two forms, directly
dissolved in the water, and combined with lime as calcium bicarbonate (hard waters
sometimes contain very much carbonic acid in this form). The tension of the carbonic
anhydride in the first form varies with the temperature, and its amount with the partial
pressure, and that in the form of acid salts is under the same conditions, for direct
experiments have shown a similar dependence in this case, although the quantitative
relations are different in the two cases.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_310" id="Footnote_32_310"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_310"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> In studying the phenomena of nature the conclusion is arrived at that the
universally reigning state of mobile equilibrium forms the chief reason for that harmonious
order which impresses all observers. It not unfrequently happens that we do not see the
causes regulating the order and harmony; in the particular instance of carbonic
anhydride, it is a striking circumstance that in the first instance a search was made
for an harmonious and strict uniformity, and in incidental (insufficiently accurate and
fragmentary) observations conditions were even found for concluding it to be absent.
When, later, the rule of this uniformity was confirmed, then the causes regulating
such order were also discovered. The researches of Schloesing were of this character.
Deville's idea of the dissociation of the acid carbonates of sea-water is suggested in
them. In many other cases also, a correct interpretation can only follow from a detailed
investigation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_311" id="Footnote_33_311"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_311"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The difference of the weight of a litre of dry air (free from carbonic anhydride) at
0° and 760 mm., at different longitudes and altitudes, depends on the fact that the force
of gravity varies under these conditions, and with it the pressure of the barometrical
column also varies. This is treated in detail in my works <i>On the Elasticity of Gases</i>
and <i>On Barometric Levellings</i>, and &lsquo;The Publications of the Weights and Measures
Department&rsquo; (<i>Journal of the Russian Physico-Chemical Society</i>, 1894).</p>

<p>In reality the weight is not measured in absolute units of weight (in pressure&mdash;refer
to works on mechanics and physics), but in relative units (grams, scale weights) whose
mass is invariable, and therefore the variation of the weight of the weights itself with
the change of gravity must not be here taken into account, for we are here dealing with
weights proportional to masses, since with a change of locality the weight of the
weights varies as the weight of a given volume of air does. In other words: the mass of
a substance always remains constant, but the pressure produced by it varies with the
acceleration of gravity: the gram, pound, and other units of weight are really units of
mass.</p></div>

under these conditions (H, <i>t</i>, and <i>f</i>) be obtained by the formula <i>e</i> = 1·20671 + 0·0016
[H<sub>1</sub> - 755 + 2·6(18° - <i>t</i>°)] where H<sub>1</sub> = H - 0·38<i>f</i>. In determining the weight of small and
heavy objects (crucibles, &amp;c. in analysis, and in determining the specific gravities
of liquids, &amp;c.) <i>a correction may be introduced for the loss of weight</i> in the air of the room,
by taking the weight of a litre of air displaced as 1·2 gram, and consequently 0·0012 gram
for every cubic centimetre. But if gases or, in general, large vessels are weighed, and the
weighings require to be accurate, it is necessary to take into account all the data for the
determination of the density of the air (<i>t</i>, H, and <i>f</i>), because sensitive balances can
determine the possible variations of the weight of air, as in the case of a litre the
weight of air varies in centigrams, even at a constant temperature, with variations of H
and <i>f</i>. Some time ago (1859) I proposed the following method and applied it for this
purpose. A large light and closed vessel is taken, and its volume and weight in a vacuum
are accurately determined, and verified from time to time. On weighing it we obtain
the weight in air of a given density, and by subtracting this weight from its absolute
weight and dividing by its volume we obtain the density of the air.</p></div>

rivers, seas, &amp;c., and showed that the amount of the gas is interchangeable between them.
The ratio between the amount of ammonia in a cubic metre of air and a litre of water
at 0° = 0·004, at 10° = 0·010, at 25° = 0·040 to 1, and therefore in nature there is a state
of equilibrium in the amount of ammonia in the atmosphere and waters.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_315" id="Footnote_37_315"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_315"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Whilst formed in the air these oxidising substances (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, ozone and hydrogen
peroxide) at the same time rapidly disappear from it by oxidising those substances which
are capable of being oxidised. Owing to this instability their amounts vary considerably,
and, as would be expected, they are met with to an appreciable amount in pure air, whilst
their amount decreases to zero in the air of cities, and especially in dwellings where there
is a maximum of substances capable of oxidisation and a minimum of conditions for the
formation of such bodies. There is a causal connection between the amount of these
substances present in the air and its purity&mdash;that is, the amount of foreign residues of
organic origin liable to oxidation present in the air. Where there is much of such
residues their amount must be small. When they are present the amount of organic
substances must be small, as otherwise they would be destroyed. For this reason
efforts have been made to apply ozone for purifying the air by evolving it by artificial
means in the atmosphere; for instance, by passing a series of electrical sparks through
the ventilating pipes conveying air into a building. Air thus ozonised destroys by oxidation&mdash;that
is, brings about the combustion of&mdash;the organic residues present in the air, and
thus will serve for purifying it. For these reasons the air of cities contains less ozone
and such like oxidising agents than country air. This forms the distinguishing feature
of country air. However, animal life cannot exist in air containing a comparatively large
amount of ozone.</p></div>

still upheld by many, has since the work of Pasteur and his followers (and to a certain
extent of his predecessors) been discarded, because it has been proved how, when, and
whence (from the air, water, &amp;c.) the germs appear; that fermentation as well as infectious
diseases cannot take place without them; and chiefly because it has been shown that
any change accompanied by the development of the organisms introduced may be brought
about at will by the introduction of the germs into a suitable medium.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_319" id="Footnote_41_319"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_319"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> In further confirmation of the fact that putrefaction and fermentation depend on
germs carried in the air, we may cite the circumstance that poisonous substances destroying
the life of organisms stop or hinder the appearance of the above processes.
Air which has been heated to redness or passed through sulphuric acid no longer contains
the germs of organisms, and loses the faculty of producing fermentation and putrefaction.</p></div>

and owing to their microscopical dimensions, they, as it were, hang in the air in
virtue of their large surfaces compared to their weight. In Paris the amount of dust
suspended in the air equals from 6 (after rain) to 23 grams per 1,000 c.m. of air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_321" id="Footnote_43_321"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_321"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> We see similar cases everywhere. For example, the predominating mass of sand
and clay in the soil takes hardly any chemical part in the economy of the soil in respect
to the nourishment of plants. The plants by their roots search for substances which are
diffused in comparatively small quantities in the soil. If a large quantity of these
nourishing substances are removed, then the plants will not develop in the soil, just as
animals die in oxygen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_322" id="Footnote_44_322"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_322"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> A man in breathing burns about 10 grams of carbon per hour&mdash;that is, he produces
about 880 grams, or (as 1 cub.m. of carbonic anhydride weighs about 2,000 grams) about
<sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>12</sub> c.m. of carbonic anhydride. The air coming from the lungs contains 4 p.c. of carbonic
anhydride by volume. The exhaled air acts as a direct poison, owing to this gas and to
other impurities.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_323" id="Footnote_45_323"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_323"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> For this reason candles, lamps, and gas change the composition of air almost in
the same way as respiration. In the burning of 1 kilogram of stearin candles, 50 cubic
metres of air are changed as by respiration&mdash;that is, 4 p.c. of carbonic anhydride will be
formed in this volume of air. The respiration of animals and exhalations from their skins,
and especially from the intestines and the excrements and the transformations taking
place in them, contaminate the air to a still greater extent, because they introduce other
volatile substances besides carbonic anhydride into the air. At the same time that
carbonic anhydride is formed the amount of oxygen in the air decreases, and there is
noticed the appearance of miasmata which occur in but small quantity, but which are
noticeable in passing from fresh air into a confined space full of such adulterated air.
The researches of Schmidt and Leblanc and others show that even with 20·6 p.c. of
oxygen (instead of 20·9 p.c.), when the diminution is due to respiration, air becomes
noticeably less fit for respiration, and that the heavy feeling experienced in such air
increases with a lesser percentage of oxygen. It is difficult to remain for a few minutes
in air containing 17·2 p.c. of oxygen. These observations were chiefly obtained by
observations on the air of different mines, at different depths below the surface. The
air of theatres and buildings full of people also proves to contain less oxygen; it was
found on one occasion that at the end of a theatrical representation the air in the stalls
contained 20·75 p.c. of oxygen, whilst the air at the upper part of the theatre contained
only 20·36 p.c. The amount of carbonic anhydride in the air may be taken as a measure
of its purity (Pettenkofer). When it reaches 1 p.c. it is very difficult for human beings
to remain long in such air, and it is necessary to set up a vigorous ventilation for the
removal of the adulterated air. In order to keep the air in dwellings in a uniformly good
state, it is necessary to introduce at least 10 cubic metres of fresh air per hour per
person. We saw that a man exhales about five-twelfths of a cubic metre of carbonic anhydride
per day. Accurate observations have shown that air containing one-tenth p.c. of
exhaled carbonic anhydride (and consequently also a corresponding amount of the other
substances evolved together with it) is not felt to be oppressive; and therefore the five-twelfth
cubic metres of carbonic anhydride should be diluted with 420 cubic metres of
fresh air if it be desired to keep not more than one-tenth p.c. (by volume) of carbonic
anhydride in the air. Hence a man requires 420 cubic metres of air per day, or 18 cubic
metres per hour. With the introduction of only 10 cubic metres of fresh air per person,
the amount of carbonic anhydride may reach one-fifth p.c., and the air will not then be of
the requisite freshness.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_324" id="Footnote_46_324"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_324"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> The <i>ventilation</i> of inhabited buildings is most necessary, and is even indispensable
in hospitals, schools, and similar buildings. In winter it is carried on by the so-called
calorifiers or stoves heating the air before it enters. The best kind of calorifiers in this
respect are those in which the fresh cold air is led through a series of pipes heated by
the hot gases coming from a stove. In ventilation, particularly during winter, care is taken
that the incoming air shall be moist, because in winter the amount of moisture in the
air is very small. Ventilation, besides introducing fresh air into a dwelling-place, must
also withdraw the air already spoilt by respiration and other causes&mdash;that is, it is necessary
to construct channels for the escape of the bad air, besides those for the introduction
of fresh air. In ordinary dwelling-places, where not many people are congregated, the
ventilation is conducted by natural means, in the heating by fires, through crevices,
windows, and various orifices in walls, doors, and windows. In mines, factories, and workrooms
ventilation is of the greatest importance.</p>

<p>Animal vitality may still continue for a period of several minutes in air containing up
to 30 p.c. of carbonic anhydride, if the remaining 70 p.c. consist of ordinary air; but respiration
ceases after a certain time, and death may even ensue. The flame of a candle
is very easily extinguished in an atmosphere containing from 5 to 6 p.c. of carbonic anhydride,
but animal vitality can be sustained in it for a somewhat long time, although the
effect of such air is exceedingly painful even to the lower animals. There are mines in
which a lighted candle easily goes out from the excess of carbonic anhydride, but in which
the miners have to remain for a long time. The presence of 1 p.c. of carbonic oxide is
deadly even to cold-blooded animals. The air in the galleries of a mine where blasting
has taken place, is known to produce a state of insensibility resembling that produced by
charcoal fumes. Deep wells and vaults not unfrequently contain similar substances, and
their atmosphere often causes suffocation. The atmospheres of such places cannot be
tested by lowering a lighted candle into it, as these poisonous gases would not extinguish
the flame. This method only suffices to indicate the amount of carbonic anhydride. If
a candle keeps alight, it signifies that there is less than 6 p.c. of this gas. In doubtful
cases it is best to lower a dog or other animal into the air to be tested. If CO<sub>2</sub> be very
carefully added to air, the flame of a candle is not extinguished (although it becomes
very much smaller) even when the gas amounts to 12 p.c. of air. Researches made by
F. Clowes (1894) show that the flames (in every case &frac34; in. long) of different combustible
substances are extinguished by the gradual addition of different percentages of nitrogen and
carbonic acid to the air; the percentage sufficient to extinguish the flame being as
follows (the percentage of oxygen is given in parenthesis):</p>

<p>The flames of all solid and liquid substances is extinguished by almost the same percentage
of CO<sub>2</sub> or N<sub>2</sub>, but the flames of different gases vary in this respect, and hydrogen
continues to burn in mixtures which are far poorer in oxygen than those in which the
flames of other combustible gases are extinguished; the flame of methane CH<sub>4</sub> is the
most easily extinguished. The percentage of nitrogen may be greater than that of CO<sub>2</sub>.
This, together with the fact that, under the above circumstances, the flame of a gas
before going out becomes fainter and increases in size, seems to indicate that the chief
reason for the extinction of the flame is the fall in its temperature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_325" id="Footnote_47_325"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_325"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> Different so-called disinfectants purify the air, and prevent the injurious action of
certain of its components by changing or destroying them. Disinfection is especially
necessary in those places where a considerable amount of volatile substances are
evolved into the air, and where organic substances are decomposed; for instance,
in hospitals, closets, &amp;c. The numerous disinfectants are of the most varied nature.
They may be divided into oxidising, antiseptic, and absorbent substances. To the
oxidising substances used for disinfection belong chlorine, and various substances
evolving it, because chlorine in the presence of water oxidises the majority of organic
substances, and this is why chlorine is used as a disinfectant for Siberian plagues.
Further, to this class belong the permanganates of the alkalis and peroxide of hydrogen,
as substances easily oxidising matters dissolved in water; these salts are not volatile
like chlorine, and therefore act much more slowly, and in a much more limited sphere.
Antiseptic substances are those which convert organic substances into such as are little
prone to change, and prevent putrefaction and fermentation. They most probably kill
the germs of organisms occurring in miasmata. The most important of these substances
are creosote and phenol (carbolic acid), which occur in tar, and act in preserving smoked
meat. Phenol is a substance little soluble in water, volatile, oily, and having the
characteristic smell of smoked objects. Its action on animals in considerable quantities
is injurious, but in small quantities, used in the form of a weak solution, it prevents the
change of animal matter. The smell of privies, which depends on the change of excremental
matter, may be easily removed by means of chlorine or phenol. Salicylic acid,
thymol, common tar, and especially its solution in alkalis as proposed by Nensky, &amp;c.,
are also substances having the same property. Absorbent substances are of no less
importance, especially as preventatives, than the preceding two classes of disinfectants,
inasmuch as they are innocuous. They are those substances which absorb the odoriferous
gases and vapours emitted during putrefaction, which are chiefly ammonia,
sulphuretted hydrogen, and other volatile compounds. To this class belong charcoal,
certain salts of iron, gypsum, salts of magnesia, and similar substances, as well as peat,
mould, and clay. Questions of disinfection and ventilation appertain to the most
serious problems of common life and hygiene. These questions are so vast that we are
here able only to give a short outline of their nature.</p></div>

The bones are heated in the vertical cylinders C (about

products of distillation pass through the tubes T, into
the condenser B, and receiver F. When the distillation
is completed the trap H is opened, and the burnt bones
are loaded into trucks V. The roof M is then opened,
and the cylinders are charged with a fresh quantity of

<p>In the <a href="#Page_223">last chapter</a> we saw that nitrogen does not directly combine
with hydrogen, but that a mixture of these gases in the presence of
hydrochloric acid gas, HCl,
forms ammonium chloride,
NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, on the passage of a
series of electric sparks.<a name="FNanchor_1_326" id="FNanchor_1_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_326" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In
ammonium chloride, HCl is
combined with NH<sub>3</sub>, consequently
N with H<sub>3</sub> forms
ammonia.<a name="FNanchor_2_327" id="FNanchor_2_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_327" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Almost all the
<i>nitrogenous substances of
plants and animals</i> evolve
ammonia when heated with
an alkali. But even without
the presence of an alkali
the majority of nitrogenous
substances, when decomposed
or heated with a limited
supply of air, evolve their
nitrogen, if not entirely, at
all events partially, in the form of ammonia. When animal substances
such as skins, bones, flesh, hair, horns, &amp;c., are heated without access of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
air in iron retorts&mdash;they undergo what is termed dry distillation. A
portion of the resultant substances remains in the retort and forms a
carbonaceous residue, whilst the other portion, in virtue of its volatility,
escapes through the tube leading from the retort. The vapours given
off, on cooling, form a liquid which separates into two layers; the one,
which is oily, is composed of the so-called animal oils (<i>oleum animale</i>):
the other, an aqueous layer, contains a solution of ammonia salts. If
this solution be mixed with lime and heated, the lime takes up the
elements of carbonic acid from the ammonia salts, and ammonia is
evolved as a gas.<a name="FNanchor_3_328" id="FNanchor_3_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_328" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> In ancient times ammonia compounds were
imported into Europe from Egypt, where they were prepared from the
soot obtained in the employment of camels' dung as fuel in the locality
of the temple of Jupiter Ammon (in Lybia), and therefore the salt
obtained was called &lsquo;sal-ammoniacale,&rsquo; from which the name of ammonia
is derived. At the present time ammonia is obtained exclusively, on a
large scale, either from the products of the dry distillation of animal or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
vegetable refuse, from urine, or from the ammoniacal liquors collected in
the destructive distillation of coal for the preparation of coal gas. This
ammoniacal liquor is placed in a retort with lime and heated; the
ammonia is then evolved together with steam.<a name="FNanchor_4_329" id="FNanchor_4_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_329" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the arts, only a
small amount of ammonia is used in a free state&mdash;that is, in an aqueous
solution; the greater portion of it is converted into different salts
having technical uses, especially sal-ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and ammonium
sulphate, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. They are saline substances which are formed
because ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, combines with all acids, HX, forming ammonia
salts, NH<sub>4</sub>X. Sal-ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, is a compound of ammonia with
hydrochloric acid. It is prepared by passing the vapours of ammonia
and water, evolved, as above described, from ammoniacal liquor, into
an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, and on evaporating the
solution sal-ammoniac is obtained in the form of soluble crystals<a name="FNanchor_5_330" id="FNanchor_5_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_330" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
resembling common salt in appearance and properties. Ammonia may
be very easily prepared <i>from</i> this <i>sal-ammoniac</i>, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, as from any
other ammoniacal salt, by heating it with lime. Calcium hydroxide,
CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as an alkali takes up the acid and sets free the ammonia,
forming calcium chloride, according to the equation 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
= 2H<sub>2</sub>O + CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2NH<sub>3</sub>. In this reaction the ammonia is evolved as
a gas.<a name="FNanchor_6_331" id="FNanchor_6_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_331" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

works by the dry distillation of coal, or by the fermentation of urine, &amp;c. This water is mixed
with lime and poured into the boiler C&#8243;, and from thence into C&#8242; and C consecutively. The last
boiler is heated directly over a furnace, and hence no ammonia remains in solution after the
liquid has been boiled in it. The liquid is therefore then thrown away. The ammonia vapour
and steam pass from the boiler C, through the tube T, into the boiler C&#8242;, and then into C&#8243;, so that
the solution in C&#8242; becomes stronger than that in C, and still stronger in C&#8243;. The boilers are furnished
with stirrers A, A&#8242;, and A&#8243; to prevent the lime settling. From C&#8243; the ammonia and steam
pass through the tube T&#8243; into worm condensers surrounded with cold water, thence into the
Woulfe's bottle P, where the solution of ammonia is collected, and finally the still uncondensed
ammonia vapour is led into the flat vessel R, containing acid which absorbs the last traces of
ammonia.</p></div>

<p>It must be observed that all the complex nitrogenous substances of
plants, animals, and soils are decomposed when heated with an excess
of sulphuric acid, the whole of their nitrogen being converted into
ammonium sulphate, from which it may be liberated by treatment with
an excess of alkali. This reaction is so complete that it forms the
basis of Kjeldahl's method for estimating the amount of nitrogen in its
compounds.</p>

ammonia in a thick bent

<p>Ammonia is a colourless gas, resembling those with which we are
already acquainted in its outward appearance, but clearly distinguishable
from any other gas by its very characteristic and pungent smell. It
irritates the eyes, and it is positively impossible to inhale it. Animals
die in it. Its density, referred to hydrogen, is 8·5; hence it is lighter
than air. It belongs to the class of gases which are easily liquefied.<a name="FNanchor_7_332" id="FNanchor_7_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_332" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
Faraday employed the following method for liquefying ammonia.
Ammonia when passed over dry silver chloride, AgCl, is absorbed by it
to a considerable extent, especially at low temperatures.<a name="FNanchor_8_333" id="FNanchor_8_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_333" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The solid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
compound AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> thus obtained is introduced into a bent tube
(fig. <a href="#fig_45">45</a>), whose open end c is then fused up. The compound is then
slightly heated at <i>a</i>, and the ammonia comes off,
owing to the easy dissociation of the compound.
The other end of the tube is immersed in a freezing
mixture. The pressure of the gas coming off,
combined with the low temperature at one end of
the tube, causes the ammonia evolved to condense
into a liquid, in which form it collects at the cold
end of the tube. If the heating be stopped, the
silver chloride again absorbs the ammonia. In
this manner one tube may serve for repeated experiments. Ammonia
may also be liquefied by the ordinary methods&mdash;that is, by means of
pumping dry ammonia gas into a refrigerated space. Liquefied
ammonia is a colourless and very mobile liquid,<a name="FNanchor_9_334" id="FNanchor_9_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_334" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> whose specific gravity
at 0° is 0·63 (E. Andréeff). At the temperature (about -70°) given by
a mixture of liquid carbonic anhydride and ether, liquid ammonia
crystallises, and in this form its odour is feeble, because at so low a
temperature its vapour tension is very inconsiderable. The boiling
point (at a pressure of 760 mm.) of liquid ammonia is about -32°.
Hence this temperature may be obtained at the ordinary pressure by
the evaporation of liquefied ammonia.</p>

<p>Ammonia, containing, as it does, much hydrogen, is <i>capable of
combustion</i>; it does not, however, burn steadily, and sometimes not
at all, in ordinary atmospheric air. In pure oxygen it burns with
a greenish-yellow flame,<a name="FNanchor_10_335" id="FNanchor_10_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_335" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> forming water, whilst the nitrogen set free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
gives its oxygen compounds&mdash;that is, oxides of nitrogen. The decomposition
of ammonia into hydrogen and nitrogen not only takes place at a
red heat and under the action of electric sparks, but also by means of
many oxidising substances; for instance, by passing ammonia through
a tube containing red-hot copper oxide. The water thus formed may
be collected by substances absorbing it, and the quantity of nitrogen
may be measured in a gaseous form, and thus the composition of
ammonia determined. In this manner it is very easy to prove that
ammonia contains 3 parts by weight of hydrogen to 14 parts by
weight of nitrogen; and, by volume, 3 vols. of hydrogen and 1 vol. of
nitrogen form 2 vols. of ammonia.<a name="FNanchor_11_336" id="FNanchor_11_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_336" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Ammonia is capable of combining with a number of substances,
forming, like water, substances of various degrees of stability. It is
more soluble than any of the gases yet described, both in water and in
many aqueous solutions. We have already seen, in the <a href="#Page_40">first chapter</a>,
that one volume of water, at the ordinary temperature, dissolves about
700 vols. of ammonia gas. The great solubility of ammonia enables it
to be always kept ready for use in the form of an aqueous solution,<a name="FNanchor_12_337" id="FNanchor_12_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_337" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
which is commercially known as <i>spirits of hartshorn</i>. Ammonia water
is continually evolving ammoniacal vapour, and so has the characteristic
smell of ammonia itself. It is a very characteristic and important fact
that ammonia has an alkaline reaction, and colours litmus paper blue,
just like caustic potash or lime; it is therefore sometimes called <i>caustic
ammonia</i> (volatile alkali). Acids may be saturated by ammonia water
or gas in exactly the same way as by any other alkali. In this process
<i>ammonia combines directly with acids</i>, and this forms the most essential<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
chemical reaction of this substance. If sulphuric, nitric, acetic, or any
other acid be brought into contact with ammonia it absorbs it, and in
so doing evolves a large amount of heat and forms a compound having
all the properties of a salt. Thus, for example, sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
in absorbing ammonia, forms (on evaporating the solution) two salts,
according to the relative quantities of ammonia and acid. One salt is
formed from NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and consequently has the composition
NH<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and the other is formed from 2NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and its composition
is therefore N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>8</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The former has an acid reaction and the
latter a neutral reaction, and they are called respectively acid ammonium
sulphate (ammonium hydrogen sulphate), and normal ammonium
sulphate, or simply ammonium sulphate. The same takes place in the
action of all other acids; but certain of them are able to form normal
ammonium salts only, whilst others give both acid and normal ammonium
salts. This depends on the nature of the acid and not on the ammonia,
as we shall afterwards see. Ammonium salts are very similar in appearance
and in many of their properties to metallic salts; for instance,
sodium chloride, or table salt, resembles sal-ammoniac, or ammonium
chloride, not only in its outward appearance but even in crystalline
form, in its property of giving precipitates with silver salts, in its solubility
in water, and in its evolving hydrochloric acid when heated with
sulphuric acid&mdash;in a word, a most perfect analogy is to be remarked
in an entire series of reactions. An analogy in composition is seen
if sal-ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, be compared with table salt, NaCl; and the
ammonium hydrogen sulphate, NH<sub>4</sub>HSO<sub>4</sub>, with the sodium hydrogen
sulphate, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>; or ammonium nitrate, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, with sodium
nitrate, NaNO<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_13_338" id="FNanchor_13_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_338" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> It is seen, on comparing the above compounds, that
the part which sodium takes in the sodium salts is played in ammonium
salts by a group NH<sub>4</sub>, which is called <i>ammonium</i>. If table salt be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
called &lsquo;sodium chloride,&rsquo; then sal-ammoniac should be and is called
&lsquo;ammonium chloride.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The hypothesis that ammoniacal salts correspond with a complex
metal ammonium bears the name of the <i>ammonium theory</i>. It was
enunciated by the famous Swedish chemist Berzelius after the proposition
made by Ampère. The analogy admitted between ammonium and
metals is probable, owing to the fact that mercury is able to form an
amalgam with ammonium similar to that which it forms with sodium
or many other metals. The only difference between ammonium amalgam
and sodium amalgam consists in the instability of the ammonium, which
easily decomposes into ammonia and hydrogen.<a name="FNanchor_14_339" id="FNanchor_14_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_339" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Ammonium amalgam
may be prepared from sodium amalgam. If the latter be shaken up
with a strong solution of sal-ammoniac, the mercury swells up violently
and loses its mobility whilst preserving its metallic appearance. In so
doing, the mercury dissolves ammonium&mdash;that is, the sodium in the
mercury is replaced by the ammonium, and replaces it in the sal-ammoniac,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
forming sodium chloride, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + HgNa = NaCl + HgNH<sub>4</sub>.
Naturally, the formation of ammonium amalgam does not entirely prove
the existence of ammonium itself in a separate state; but it shows the
possibility of this substance existing, and its analogy with the metals,
because only metals dissolve in mercury.<a name="FNanchor_15_340" id="FNanchor_15_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_340" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Ammonium amalgam crystallises
in cubes, three times heavier than water; it is only stable in the
cold, and particularly at very low temperatures. It begins to decompose
at the ordinary temperature, evolving ammonia and hydrogen in the
proportion of two volumes of ammonia and one volume of hydrogen,
NH<sub>4</sub> = NH<sub>3</sub> + H. By the action of water, ammonium amalgam gives
hydrogen and ammonia water, just as sodium amalgam gives hydrogen
and sodium hydroxide; and therefore, in accordance with the ammonium
theory, ammonia water must be looked on as containing ammonium
hydroxide, NH<sub>4</sub>OH,<a name="FNanchor_16_341" id="FNanchor_16_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_341" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> just as an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide,
contains NaOH. The ammonium hydroxide, like ammonium itself, is
an unstable substance, which easily dissociates, and can only exist in
a free state at low temperatures.<a name="FNanchor_17_342" id="FNanchor_17_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_342" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Ordinary solutions of ammonia
must be looked on as the products of the dissociation of this hydroxide,
inasmuch as NH<sub>4</sub>OH = NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>All ammoniacal salts <i>decompose at a red heat</i> into ammonia and an
acid, which, on cooling in contact with each other, re-combine together.
If the acid be non-volatile, the ammoniacal salt, when heated, evolves
the ammonia, leaving the non-volatile acid behind; if the acid be
volatile, then, on heating, both the acid and ammonia volatilise together,
and on cooling re-combine into the salt which originally served for the
formation of their vapours.<a name="FNanchor_18_343" id="FNanchor_18_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_343" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Ammonia is not only capable of combining with acids, but also
with many salts, as was seen from its forming definite compounds,
AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> and 2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>, with silver chloride. Just as ammonia
is absorbed by various oxygen salts of the metals, so also is it absorbed
by the chlorine, iodine, and bromine compounds of many metals, and in
so doing evolves heat. Certain of these compounds part with their
ammonia even when left exposed to the air, but others only do so at a
red heat; many give up their ammonia when dissolved, whilst others
dissolve without decomposition, and when evaporated separate from their
solutions unchanged. All these facts only indicate that ammoniacal,
like aqueous, compounds dissociate with greater or lesser facility.<a name="FNanchor_19_344" id="FNanchor_19_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_344" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
Certain metallic oxides also absorb ammonia and are dissolved in
ammonia water. Such are, for instance, the oxides of zinc, nickel,
copper, and many others; the majority of such compounds are unstable.
The property of ammonia of combining with certain oxides explains
its action on certain metals.<a name="FNanchor_20_345" id="FNanchor_20_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_345" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> By reason of such action, copper vessels
are not suitable for holding liquids containing ammonia. Iron is not
acted on by such liquids.</p>

<p>The similarity between the relation of ammonia and water to salts
and other substances is more especially marked in those cases in which
the salt is capable of combining with both ammonia and water. Take,
for example, copper sulphate, CuSO<sub>4</sub>. As we saw in Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>., it
gives with water blue crystals, CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O; but it also absorbs
ammonia in the same molecular proportion, forming a blue substance,
CuSO<sub>4</sub>,5NH<sub>3</sub>, and therefore the ammonia combining with salts may
be termed <i>ammonia of crystallisation</i>.</p>

<p>Such are the <i>reactions of combination</i> proper to ammonia. Let us
now turn our attention to the reactions of substitution proper to this
substance. If ammonia be passed through a heated tube containing
metallic sodium, hydrogen is evolved, and a compound is obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
containing ammonia in which one atom of hydrogen is replaced by an atom
of sodium, NH<sub>2</sub>Na (according to the equation NH<sub>3</sub> + Na = NH<sub>2</sub>Na + H).
This body is termed sodium amide. We shall afterwards see that
iodine and chlorine are also capable of directly displacing hydrogen from
ammonia, and of replacing it. In fact, the hydrogen of ammonia may
be replaced in many ways by different elements. If in this replacement
NH<sub>2</sub> remains, the resultant substances NH<sub>2</sub>R are called <i>amides</i>, whilst
the substitution products, NHR<sub>2</sub>, in which only NH remains, are called
<i>imides</i>,<a name="FNanchor_20_BIS_346" id="FNanchor_20_BIS_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_BIS_346" class="fnanchor">[20 bis]</a> and those in which none of the ammoniacal hydrogen
remains, NR<sub>3</sub>, are known as <i>nitrides</i>. Free amidogen, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, is now
known in a state of hydration under the name of hydrazine;<a name="FNanchor_21_347" id="FNanchor_21_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_347" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> it combines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
with acids and resembles ammonia in this respect. In the action
of different substances on ammonia it is the <i>hydrogen that is substituted</i>,
whilst the nitrogen remains in the resultant compound, so to say, untouched.
The same phenomenon is to be observed in the action of
various substances on water. In the majority of cases the reactions
of water consist in the hydrogen being evolved, and in its being
replaced by different elements. This also takes place, as we have seen,
in acids in which the hydrogen is easily displaced by metals. This
chemical mobility of hydrogen is perhaps connected with the great
lightness of the atoms of this element.</p>

<p>In practical chemistry<a name="FNanchor_21_BIS_348" id="FNanchor_21_BIS_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_BIS_348" class="fnanchor">[21 bis]</a> ammonia is often employed, not only for
saturating acids, but also for effecting reactions of double decomposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
with salts, and especially for separating insoluble basic hydroxides
from soluble salts. Let MHO stand for an insoluble basic hydroxide
and HX for an acid. The salt formed by them will have a composition
MHO + XH - H<sub>2</sub>O = MX. If aqueous ammonia, NH<sub>4</sub>OH, be added
to a solution of this salt, the ammonia will change places with the
metal M, and thus form the insoluble basic hydroxide, or, as it is said,
give a precipitate.</p>

<p>Thus, for instance, if aqueous ammonia is added to a solution of a
salt of aluminium, then alumina hydrate is separated out as a colourless
gelatinous precipitate.<a name="FNanchor_22_349" id="FNanchor_22_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_349" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>In order to grasp the relation between ammonia and the oxygen
compounds of nitrogen it is necessary to recognise the general <i>law of
substitution</i>, applicable to all cases of substitution between elements,<a name="FNanchor_23_350" id="FNanchor_23_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_350" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and therefore showing what may be the cases of substitution between
oxygen and hydrogen as component parts of water. The law of substitution
may be deduced from mechanical principles if the molecule be
conceived as a system of elementary atoms occurring in a certain chemical
and mechanical equilibrium. By likening the molecule to a system of
bodies in a state of motion&mdash;for instance, to the sum total of the sun,
planets, and satellites, existing in conditions of mobile equilibrium&mdash;then
we should expect the action of one part, in this system, to be
equal and opposite to the other, according to Newton's third law of
mechanics. Hence, given a molecule of a compound, for instance,
H<sub>2</sub>O, NH<sub>3</sub>, NaCl, HCl, &amp;c., its every two parts must in a chemical sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
represent two things somewhat alike in force and properties, and therefore
<i>every two parts into which a molecule of a compound may be divided
are capable of replacing each other</i>. In order that the application of
the law should become clear it is evident that among compounds the
most stable should be chosen. We will therefore take hydrochloric acid
and water as the most stable compounds of hydrogen.<a name="FNanchor_24_351" id="FNanchor_24_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_351" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> According to
the above law of substitution, if the elements H and Cl are able to
form a molecule, HCl, and a stable one, they are able to replace each
other. And, indeed, we shall afterwards see (Chapter <a href="#Page_459">XI</a>.) that in a
number of instances a substitution between hydrogen and chlorine can
take place. Given RH, then RCl is possible, because HCl exists and
is stable. The molecule of water, H<sub>2</sub>O, may be divided in two ways,
because it contains 3 atoms: into H and (HO) on the one hand, and
into H<sub>2</sub> and O on the other. Consequently, being given RH, its
substitution products will be R(HO) according to the first form, and
R<sub>2</sub>O according to the second; being given RH<sub>2</sub>, its corresponding
substitution products will be RH(OH), R(OH)<sub>2</sub>, RO, (RH)<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c.
The group (OH) is the same hydroxyl or aqueous radicle which we
have already mentioned in the <a href="#Page_152">third chapter</a> as a component part of
hydroxides and alkalis&mdash;for instance, Na(OH), Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. It is
evident, judging from H(HO) and HCl, that (OH) can be substituted by
Cl, because both are replaceable by H; and this is of common occurrence
in chemistry, because metallic chlorides&mdash;for example, NaCl and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl&mdash;correspond
with hydroxides of the alkalis Na(OH) or NH<sub>4</sub>(OH).
In hydrocarbons&mdash;for instance, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>&mdash;the hydrogen is replaceable by
chlorine and by hydroxyl. Thus ordinary alcohol is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, in which
one atom of H is replaced by (OH); that is, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH). It is evident
that the replacement of hydrogen by hydroxyl essentially forms the
phenomenon of oxidation, because RH gives R(OH), or RHO.
Hydrogen peroxide may in this sense be regarded as water in which the
hydrogen is replaced by hydroxyl; H(OH) gives (OH)<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The
other form of substitution&mdash;namely, that of O in the place of H<sub>2</sub>&mdash;is
also a common chemical phenomenon. Thus alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, or
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH), when oxidising in the air, gives acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O(OH), in which H<sub>2</sub> is replaced by O.</p>

<p>In the further course of this work we shall have occasion to refer to
the law of substitution for explaining many chemical phenomena and
relations.</p>

<p>We will now apply these conceptions to ammonia in order to see its
relation to the oxygen compounds of nitrogen. It is evident that many
substances should be obtainable from ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, or aqueous
ammonia, NH<sub>4</sub>(OH), by substituting their hydrogen by hydroxyl, or H<sub>2</sub>
by oxygen. And such is the case. The two extreme cases of such substitution
will be as follows: (1) One atom of H in NH<sub>3</sub> is substituted by
(OH), and NH<sub>2</sub>(OH) is produced. Such a substance, still containing
much hydrogen, should have many of the properties of ammonia. It is
known under the name of <i>hydroxylamine</i>,<a name="FNanchor_25_352" id="FNanchor_25_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_352" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and, in fact, is capable, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
ammonia, of giving salts with acids; for example, with hydrochloric
acid, NH<sub>3</sub>(OH)Cl&mdash;which is a substance corresponding to sal-ammoniac,
in which one atom of hydrogen is replaced by hydroxyl.<a name="FNanchor_25_BIS_353" id="FNanchor_25_BIS_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_BIS_353" class="fnanchor">[25 bis]</a> (2) The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
other extreme case of substitution is that given by ammonium hydroxide,
NH<sub>4</sub>(OH), when the whole of the hydrogen of the ammonium is replaced
by oxygen; and, as ammonium contains 4 atoms of hydrogen,
the highest oxygen compound should be NO<sub>2</sub>(OH), or NHO<sub>3</sub>, as we
find to be really the case, for NHO<sub>3</sub> is nitric acid, exhibiting the
highest degree of oxidation of nitrogen.<a name="FNanchor_26_354" id="FNanchor_26_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_354" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> If instead of the two
extreme aspects of substitution we take an intermediate one, we obtain
the intermediate oxygen compounds of nitrogen. For instance,
N(OH)<sub>3</sub> is orthonitrous acid,<a name="FNanchor_27_355" id="FNanchor_27_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_355" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> to which corresponds nitrous acid,
NO(OH), or NHO<sub>2</sub>, equal to N(OH)<sub>3</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>O, and nitrous anhydride,
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 2N(OH)<sub>3</sub> - 3H<sub>2</sub>O. Thus nitrogen gives a series of oxygen
compounds, which we will proceed to describe. We will, however, first
show by two examples that in the first place the passage of ammonia
into the oxygen compounds of nitrogen up to nitric acid, as well as the
converse preparation of ammonia (and consequently of the intermediate
compounds also) from nitric acid, are reactions which proceed directly
and easily under many circumstances, and in the second place that the
above general principle of substitution gives the possibility of understanding
many, at first sight unexpected and complex, relations and
transformations, such as the preparation of hydronitrous acid, HN<sub>3</sub>. In
nature the matter is complicated by a number of influences and circumstances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
but in the law the relations are presented in their simplest
aspect.</p>

<p>1. It is easy to prove the possibility of the oxidation of ammonia
into nitric acid by passing a mixture of ammonia and air over heated
spongy platinum. This causes the oxidation of the ammonia, nitric
acid being formed, which partially combines with the excess of
ammonia.</p>

<p>The converse passage of nitric acid into ammonia is effected
by the action of hydrogen at the moment of its evolution.<a name="FNanchor_28_356" id="FNanchor_28_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_356" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Thus
metallic aluminium, evolving hydrogen from a solution of caustic soda,
is able to completely convert nitric acid added to the mixture (as a salt,
because the alkali gives a salt with the nitric acid) into ammonia,
NHO<sub>3</sub> + 8H = NH<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>2. In 1890 Curtius in Germany obtained a gaseous substance of the
composition HN<sub>3</sub> (hydrogen trinitride), having the distinctive properties
of an acid, and giving, like hydrochloric acid, salts; for example, a
sodium salt, NaN<sub>3</sub>; ammonium salt, NH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>3</sub> = N<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>; barium salt,
Ba(N<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., which he therefore named hydronitrous acid, <i>HN</i><sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_28_BIS_357" id="FNanchor_28_BIS_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_BIS_357" class="fnanchor">[28 bis]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
The extraordinary composition of the compound (ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>,
contains one N atom and three H atoms; in HN<sub>3</sub>, on the contrary, there
are three N atoms and one H atom), the facile decomposition of its salts
with an explosion, and above all its distinctly acid character (an aqueous
solution shows a strong acid reaction to litmus), not only indicated
the importance of this unexpected discovery, but at first gave rise to some
perplexity as to the nature of the substance obtained, for the relations
in which HN<sub>3</sub> stood to other simple compounds of nitrogen which had
long been known was not at all evident, and the scientific spirit
especially requires that there should be a distinct bond between every
innovation, every fresh discovery, and that which is already firmly
established and known, for upon this basis is founded that apparently
paradoxical union in science of a conservative stability with an
irresistible and never-ceasing improvement. This missing, connection
between the newly discovered hydronitrous acid, HN<sub>3</sub>, and the long
known ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, and nitric acid, HNO<sub>3</sub>, may be found in the
law of substitution, starting from the well-known properties and
composition of nitric acid and ammonia, as I mentioned in the &lsquo;Journal
of the Russian Physico-Chemical Society&rsquo; (1890). The essence of the
matter lies in the fact that to the hydrate of ammonium, or caustic
ammonia, NH<sub>4</sub>OH, there should correspond, according to the law of
substitution, an ortho-nitric acid (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_27_355">27</a>), H<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>4</sub> = NO(OH)<sub>3</sub>,
which equals NH<sub>4</sub>(OH) with the substitution in it of (<i>a</i>) two atoms of
hydrogen by oxygen (O&mdash;H<sub>2</sub>) and (<i>b</i>) two atoms of hydrogen by the
aqueous radicle (OH&mdash;H). Ordinary or meta-nitric acid is merely
this ortho-nitric acid minus water. To ortho-nitric acid there should
correspond the ammoniacal salts: mono-substituted, H<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>; bi-substituted,
H(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>; and tri-substituted, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>. These
salts, containing as they do hydrogen and oxygen, like many similar
ammoniacal salts (see, for instance, Chapter <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>.&mdash;Cyanides), are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
able to part with them in the form of water. Then from the first
salt we have H<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>4</sub> - 4H<sub>2</sub>O = N<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;nitrous oxide, and from the
second H(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NO4 - 4H<sub>2</sub>O = HN<sub>3</sub>&mdash;hydronitrous acid, and from the
third (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>NO - 4H<sub>2</sub>O = N<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>&mdash;the ammonium salt of the same acid.
The composition of HN<sub>3</sub> should be thus understood, whilst its acid
properties are explained by the fact that the water (4H<sub>2</sub>O) from
H(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>N_O<sub>4</sub> is formed at the expense of the hydrogen of the ammonium
and oxygen of the nitric acid, so that there remains the same hydrogen
as in nitric acid, or that which may be replaced by metals and give
salts. Moreover, nitrogen undoubtedly belongs to that category of
metalloids which give acids, like chlorine and carbon, and therefore,
under the influence of three of its atoms, one atom of hydrogen acquires
those properties which it has in acids, just as in HCN (hydrocyanic acid)
the hydrogen has received these properties under the influence of
the carbon and nitrogen (and HN<sub>3</sub> may be regarded as HCN where C
has been replaced by N<sub>2</sub>). Moreover, besides explaining the composition
and acid properties of HN<sub>3</sub>, the above method gives the
possibility of foretelling the closeness of the bond between hydronitrous
acid and nitrous oxide, for N<sub>2</sub>O + NH<sub>3</sub> = HN<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. This reaction,
which was foreseen from the above considerations, was accomplished by
Wislicenus (1892) by the synthesis of the sodium salt, by taking the
amide of sodium, NH<sub>2</sub>Na (obtained by heating Na in a current of
NH<sub>3</sub>), and acting upon it (when heated) with nitrous oxide, N<sub>2</sub>O,
when 2NH<sub>2</sub>Na + N<sub>2</sub>O = NaN<sub>3</sub> + NaHO + NH<sub>3</sub>. The resultant salt,
NaN<sub>3</sub>, gives hydronitrous acid when acted upon by sulphuric acid,
NaN<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = NaHSO<sub>4</sub> +HN<sub>3</sub>. The latter gives, with the corresponding
solutions of their salts, the insoluble (and easily explosive)
salts of silver, AgN<sub>3</sub> (insoluble, like AgCl or AgCN), and lead, Pb(N<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The compounds of nitrogen with oxygen present an excellent
example of the law of multiple proportions, because they contain, for 14
parts by weight of nitrogen, 8, 16, 24, 32, and 40 parts respectively by
weight of oxygen. The composition of these compounds is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Of these compounds,<a name="FNanchor_29_358" id="FNanchor_29_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_358" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> nitrous and nitric oxides, peroxide of nitrogen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and nitric acid, NHO<sub>3</sub>, are characterised as being the most stable. <i>The
lower oxides, when coming into contact with the higher, may give the
intermediate forms</i>; for instance, NO and NO<sub>2</sub> form N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, <i>and the
intermediate oxides may, in splitting up, give a higher and lower oxide</i>.
So N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> gives N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, or, in the presence of water, their
hydrates.</p>

<p>We have already seen that, under certain conditions, nitrogen
combines with oxygen, and we know that ammonia may he oxidised.
In these cases various oxidation products of nitrogen are formed, but
in the presence of water and an excess of oxygen they always give
nitric acid. Nitric acid, as corresponding with the highest oxide, is
able, in deoxidising, to give the lower oxides; it is the only nitrogen
acid whose salts occur somewhat widely in nature, and it has many
technical uses, for which reason we will begin with it.</p>

<p><i>Nitric acid</i>, NHO<sub>3</sub>, is likewise known as aqua fortis. In a free
state it is only met with in nature in small quantities, in the air and
in rain-water after storms; but even in the atmosphere nitric acid does
not long remain free, but combines with ammonia, traces of which are
always found in air. On falling on the soil and into running water,
&amp;c., the nitric acid everywhere comes into contact with bases (or their
carbonates), which easily act on it, and therefore it is converted into
the nitrates of these bases. Hence nitric acid is always met with in
the form of salts in nature. The soluble salts of nitric acid are called
<i>nitres</i>. This name is derived from the Latin <i>sal nitri</i>. The potassium
salt, KNO<sub>3</sub>, is common nitre, and the sodium salt, NaNO<sub>3</sub>, Chili saltpetre,
or cubic nitre. Nitres are formed in the soil when a nitrogenous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
substance is slowly oxidised in the presence of an alkali by means of
the oxygen of the atmosphere. In nature there are very frequent
instances of such oxidation. For this reason certain soils and rubbish
heaps&mdash;for instance, lime rubbish (in the presence of a base)&mdash;lime contain
a more or less considerable amount of nitre. One of these
nitres&mdash;sodium nitrate&mdash;is extracted from the earth in large quantities
in Chili, where it was probably formed by the oxidation of animal
refuse. This kind of nitre is employed in practice for the manufacture
of nitric acid and the other oxygen compounds of nitrogen. Nitric
acid is obtained from <i>Chili saltpetre</i> by heating it with <i>sulphuric acid</i>.
The hydrogen of the sulphuric acid replaces the sodium in the nitre.
The sulphuric acid then forms either an acid salt, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, or a
normal salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, whilst nitric acid is formed from the nitre and
is volatilised. The decomposition is expressed by the equations:
(1) NaNO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = HNO<sub>3</sub> + NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, if the acid salt be formed,
and (2) 2NaNO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2HNO<sub>3</sub>, if the normal sodium
sulphate is formed. With an excess of sulphuric acid, at a moderate
heat, and at the commencement of the reaction, the decomposition
proceeds according to the first equation; and on further heating with
a sufficient amount of nitre according to the second, because the acid
salt NaHSO<sub>4</sub> itself acts like an acid (its hydrogen being replaceable
as in acids), according to the equation NaNO<sub>3</sub> + NaHSO<sub>4</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
+ HNO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The sulphuric acid, as it is said, here displaces the nitric acid from
its compound with the base.<a name="FNanchor_29_BIS_359" id="FNanchor_29_BIS_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_BIS_359" class="fnanchor">[29 bis]</a> Thus, in the reaction of sulphuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
acid on nitre there is formed a non-volatile salt of sulphuric acid, which
remains, together with an excess of this acid, in the distilling apparatus,
and nitric acid, which is converted into vapour, and may be condensed,
because it is a liquid and volatile substance. On a small scale, this
reaction may be carried on in a glass retort with a glass condenser.
On a large scale, in chemical works, the process is exactly similar, only
iron retorts are employed for holding the mixture of nitre and sulphuric
acid, and earthenware three-necked bottles are used instead of a condenser,<a name="FNanchor_30_360" id="FNanchor_30_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_360" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>

furnace, and heated by the fire, B. The flame and products of combustion are at first led along
the flue, M (in order to heat the receivers), and afterwards into L. The retort is charged with
Chili saltpetre and sulphuric acid, and the cover is luted on with clay and gypsum. A clay tube,
<i>a</i>, is fixed into the neck of the retort (in order to prevent the nitric acid from corroding the cast
iron), and a bent glass tube, D, is luted on to it. This tube carries the vapours into a series of
earthenware receivers, E. Nitric acid mixed with sulphuric acid collects in the first. The purest
nitric acid is procured from the second, whilst that which condenses in the third receiver contains
hydrochloric acid, and that in the fourth nitrous oxide. Water is poured into the last receiver in
order to condense the residual vapours.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>Nitric acid so obtained always contains water. It is extremely
difficult to deprive it of all the admixed water without destroying a
portion of the acid itself and partially converting it into lower oxides,
because without the presence of an excess of water it is very unstable.
When rapidly distilled a portion is decomposed, and there are obtained
free oxygen and lower oxides of nitrogen, which, together with the
water, remain in solution with the nitric acid. Therefore it is necessary
to work with great care in order to obtain a pure hydrate of nitric acid,
HNO<sub>3</sub>, and especially to mix the nitric acid obtained from nitre, as
above described, with sulphuric acid, which takes up the water, and to
distil it at the lowest possible temperature&mdash;that is, by placing the
retort holding the mixture in a water or oil bath and carefully heating
it. The first portion of the nitric acid thus distilled boils at 86°, has a
specific gravity at 15° of 1·526, and solidifies at -50°; it is very
unstable at higher temperatures. This is the normal hydrate, HNO<sub>3</sub>,
which corresponds with the salts, NMO<sub>3</sub>, of nitric acid. When diluted
with water nitric acid presents a higher boiling point, not only as
compared with that of the nitric acid itself, but also with that of water;
so that, if very dilute nitric acid be distilled, the first portions passing
over will consist of almost pure water, until the boiling point in the
vapours reaches 121°. At this temperature a compound of nitric acid
with water, containing about 70 p.c. of nitric acid,<a name="FNanchor_31_361" id="FNanchor_31_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_361" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> distils over; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
specific gravity at 15° = 1·421. If the solution contain less than
25 p.c. of water, then, the specific gravity of the solution being above
1·44, HNO<sub>3</sub> evaporates off and fumes in the air, forming the above
hydrate, whose vapour tension is less than that of water. Such solutions
form <i>fuming nitric acid</i>. On distilling it gives monohydrated
acid,<a name="FNanchor_32_362" id="FNanchor_32_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_362" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> HNO<sub>3</sub>; it is a hydrate boiling at 121°, so that it is obtained
from both weak and strong solutions. Fuming nitric acid, under the
action not only of organic substances, but even of heat, loses a portion
of its oxygen, forming lower oxides of nitrogen, which impart a <i>red-brown
colour</i> to it;<a name="FNanchor_33_363" id="FNanchor_33_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_363" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> the pure acid is colourless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Nitric acid, as an <i>acid hydrate</i>, enters into reactions of double
decomposition with bases, basic hydrates (alkalis), and with salts. In all
these cases a salt of nitric acid is obtained. An alkali and nitric acid
give water and a salt; so, also, a basic oxide with nitric acid gives a
salt and water; for instance, lime, CaO + 2HNO<sub>3</sub> = Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.
Many of these salts are termed nitres.<a name="FNanchor_34_364" id="FNanchor_34_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_364" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> The composition of the ordinary
salts of nitric acid may be expressed by the general formula M(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub><i>n</i></sub>,
where M indicates a metal replacing the hydrogen in one or several
(<i>n</i>) equivalents of nitric acid. We shall find afterwards that the atoms M
of metals are equivalent to one (K, Na, Ag) atom of hydrogen, or two
(Ca, Mg, Ba), or three (Al, In), or, in general, <i>n</i> atoms of hydrogen.
<i>The salts of nitric acid</i> are especially characterised by being all <i>soluble
in water</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35_365" id="FNanchor_35_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_365" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> From the property common to all these salts of entering
into double decompositions, and owing to the volatility of nitric acid,
they evolve nitric acid when heated with sulphuric acid. They all, like
the acid itself, are capable of evolving oxygen when heated, and consequently
of acting as oxidising substances; they therefore, for instance,
deflagrate with ignited carbon, the carbon burning at the expense of
the oxygen of the salt and forming gaseous products of combustion.<a name="FNanchor_36_366" id="FNanchor_36_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_366" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Nitric acid also enters into double decompositions with a number
of hydrocarbons not in any way possessing alkaline characters and not
reacting with other acids. Under these circumstances the nitric acid
gives water and a new substance termed a <i>nitro-compound</i>. The
chemical character of the nitro-compound is the same as that of the
original substance; for example, if an indifferent substance be taken,
then the nitro compound obtained from it will also be indifferent;
if an acid be taken, then an acid is obtained also.<a name="FNanchor_36_BIS_367" id="FNanchor_36_BIS_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_BIS_367" class="fnanchor">[36 bis]</a> Benzene,

C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, is a liquid hydrocarbon having a faint tarry smell, boiling at 80°,
and lighter than water; by the action of nitric acid nitrobenzene is
obtained, which is a substance boiling at about 210°, heavier than water,
and having an almond-like odour: it is employed in large quantities
for the preparation of aniline and aniline dyes.<a name="FNanchor_37_368" id="FNanchor_37_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_368" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> As the nitro-compounds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
contain both combustible elements (hydrogen and carbon), as
well as oxygen in unstable combination with nitrogen, in the form of
the radicle NO<sub>2</sub> of nitric acid, they decompose with an explosion when
ignited or even struck, owing to the pressure of the vapours and gases
formed&mdash;free nitrogen, carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, carbonic oxide, CO, and
aqueous vapour. In the explosion of nitro compounds<a name="FNanchor_37_BIS_369" id="FNanchor_37_BIS_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_BIS_369" class="fnanchor">[37 bis]</a> much heat is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
evolved, as in the combustion of gunpowder or detonating gas, and in
this case the force of explosion in a closed space is great, because from
a solid or liquid nitro-compound occupying a small space there proceed
vapours and gases whose elasticity is great not only from the small
space in which they are formed, but owing to the high temperature
corresponding to the combustion of the nitro-compound.<a name="FNanchor_38_370" id="FNanchor_38_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_370" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

white heat&mdash;that is, nitrogen is formed, 2NHO<sub>3</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>5</sub>.
Hence it is easily understood that nitric acid may part with its oxygen
to a number of substances capable of being oxidised.<a name="FNanchor_39_371" id="FNanchor_39_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_371" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It is consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
an <i>oxidising agent</i>. Charcoal, as we have already seen,
burns in nitric acid; phosphorus, sulphur, iodine, and the majority of
metals also decompose nitric acid, some on heating and others even at
the ordinary temperature: the substances taken are oxidised and the
nitric acid is deoxidised, yielding compounds containing less oxygen.
Only a few metals, such as gold and platinum, do not act on nitric acid,
but the majority decompose it; in so doing, an oxide of the metal is
formed, which, if it has the character of a base, acts on the remaining
nitric acid; hence, with the majority of metals the result of the
reaction is usually not an oxide of the metal, but the corresponding salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
of nitric acid, and, at the same time, one of the lower oxides of nitrogen.
The resulting salts of the metals are soluble, and hence it is said that
nitric acid <i>dissolves</i> nearly all metals.<a name="FNanchor_40_372" id="FNanchor_40_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_372" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> This case is termed the solution
of metals by acids, although it is not a case of simple solution, but a complex
chemical change of the substances taken. When treated with this
acid, those metals whose oxides do not combine with nitric acid yield
the oxide itself, and not a salt; for example, tin acts in this manner
on nitric acid, forming a hydrated oxide, SnH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which is obtained in
the form of a white powder, Sn + 4NHO<sub>3</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>SnO<sub>3</sub> + 4NO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.
Silver is able to take up still more oxygen, and to convert a large
portion of nitric acid into nitrous anhydride, 4Ag + 6HNO<sub>3</sub>
= 4AgNO<sub>3</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O. Copper takes up still more oxygen from
nitric acid, converting it into nitric oxide, and, by the action of zinc,
nitric acid is able to give up a still further quantity of nitrogen,
forming nitrous oxide, 4Zn + 10NHO<sub>3</sub> = 4Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O + 5H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_41_373" id="FNanchor_41_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_373" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
Sometimes, and especially with dilute solutions of nitric acid, the
deoxidation proceeds as far as the formation of hydroxylamine and
ammonia, and sometimes it leads to the formation of nitrogen itself.
The formation of one or other nitrogenous substance from nitric acid is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
determined, not only by the nature of the reacting substances, but also
by the relative mass of water and nitric acid, and also by the temperature
and pressure, or the sum total of the conditions of reaction; and
as in a given mixture even these conditions vary (the temperature and
the relative mass vary), it not unfrequently happens that a mixture of
different products of the deoxidation of nitric acid is formed.</p>

<p>Thus the action of nitric acid on metals consists in their being
oxidised, whilst the acid itself is converted, according to the temperature,
concentration in which it is taken, and the nature of the metal, &amp;c.,
into lower oxides, ammonia, or even into nitrogen.<a name="FNanchor_42_374" id="FNanchor_42_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_374" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Many compounds
are oxidised by nitric acid like metals and other elements; for instance,
lower oxides are converted into higher oxides. Thus, arsenious acid is
converted into arsenic acid, suboxide of iron into oxide, sulphurous
acid into sulphuric acid, the sulphides of the metals, M<sub>2</sub>S, into sulphates,
M<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c.; in a word, nitric acid brings about oxidation, its oxygen
is taken up and transferred to many other substances. Certain substances
are oxidised by strong nitric acid so rapidly and with so great
an evolution of heat that they deflagrate and burst into flame. Thus
turpentine, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>, bursts into flame when poured into fuming nitric
acid. In virtue of its oxidising property, nitric acid <i>removes the
hydrogen</i> from many substances. Thus it decomposes hydriodic acid,
separating the iodine and forming water; and if fuming nitric acid be
poured into a flask containing gaseous hydriodic acid, then a rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
reaction takes place, accompanied by flame and the separation of violet
vapours of iodine and brown fumes of oxides of nitrogen.<a name="FNanchor_43_375" id="FNanchor_43_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_375" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>As nitric acid is very easily decomposed with the separation of
oxygen, it was for a long time supposed that it was not capable of
forming the corresponding <i>nitric anhydride</i>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; but Deville first
and subsequently Weber and others, discovered the methods of its formation.
Deville obtained nitric anhydride by decomposing silver nitrate
by chlorine under the influence of a moderate heat. Chlorine acts on the
above salt at a temperature of 95° (2AgNO<sub>3</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> = 2AgCl + N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + O),
and when once the reaction is started, it continues by itself without
further heating. Brown fumes are given off, which are condensed in a
tube surrounded by a freezing-mixture. A portion condenses in this
tube and a portion remains in a gaseous state. The latter contains
free oxygen. A crystalline mass and a liquid substance are obtained in
the tube; the liquid is poured off, and a current of dry carbonic acid
gas is passed through the apparatus in order to remove all traces of
volatile substances (liquid oxides of nitrogen) adhering to the crystals
of nitric anhydride. These form a voluminous mass of rhombic crystals
(density 1·64), which sometimes are of rather large size; they melt at
about 30° and distil at about 47°. In distilling, a portion of the substance
is decomposed. With water these crystals give nitric acid.
Nitric anhydride is also obtained by the action of phosphoric anhydride,
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, on cold pure nitric acid (below 0°). During the very careful
distillation of equal parts by weight of these two substances a portion
of the acid decomposes, giving a liquid compound, H<sub>2</sub>O,2N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>
= N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,2HNO<sub>3</sub>, whilst the greater part of the nitric acid gives the
anhydride according to the equation 2NHO<sub>3</sub> + P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> = 2PHO<sub>3</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>.
On heating, nitric anhydride decomposes with an explosion, or gradually,
into nitric peroxide and oxygen, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> = N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + O.</p>

<p><i>Nitrogen peroxide</i>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and <i>nitrogen dioxide</i>, NO<sub>2</sub>, express one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and the same composition, but they should be distinguished like ordinary
oxygen and ozone, although in this case their mutual conversion is
more easily effected and takes place on vaporisation; also, O<sub>3</sub> loses heat
in passing into O<sub>2</sub>, whilst N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> absorbs heat in forming NO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Nitric acid in acting on tin and on many organic substances (for
example, starch) gives brown vapours, consisting of a mixture of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
and NO<sub>2</sub>. A purer product is obtained by the decomposition of lead
nitrate by heat, Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = 2NO<sub>2</sub> + O + PbO, when non-volatile lead
oxide, oxygen gas, and nitrogen peroxide are formed. The latter condenses,
in a well-cooled vessel, to a brown liquid, which boils at about
22°. The purest peroxide of nitrogen, solidifying at -9°, is obtained
by mixing dry oxygen in a freezing-mixture with twice its volume
of dry nitric oxide, NO, when transparent prisms of nitrogen peroxide
are formed in the receiver: they melt into a colourless liquid at about
-10°. When the temperature of the receiver is above -9°, the
crystals melt,<a name="FNanchor_44_376" id="FNanchor_44_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_376" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and at 0° give a reddish yellow liquid, like that obtained
in the decomposition of lead nitrate. The vapours of nitrogen
peroxide have a characteristic odour, and at the ordinary temperature
are of a dark-brown colour, but at lower temperatures the colour of
the vapour is much fainter. When heated, especially above 50°, the
colour becomes a very dark brown, so that the vapours almost lose their
transparency.</p>

<p>The causes of these peculiarities of nitrogen peroxide were not
clearly understood until Deville and Troost determined the density
and dissociation of the vapour of this substance at different temperatures,
and showed that the density varies. If the density be referred to that
of hydrogen at the same temperature and pressure, then it is found to
vary from 38 at the boiling point, or about 27°, to 23 at 135°, after
which the density remains constant up to those high temperatures at
which the oxides of nitrogen are decomposed. As on the basis of the
laws enunciated in the <a href="#Page_299">following chapter</a>, the density 23 corresponds
with the compound NO<sub>2</sub> (because the weight corresponding with this
molecular formula = 46, and the density referred to hydrogen as unity is
equal to half the molecular weight); therefore at temperatures above 135°
the existence of nitrogen dioxide only must be recognised. It is this
gas which is of a brown colour. At a lower temperature it forms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
nitrogen peroxide, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, whose molecular weight, and therefore density,
is twice that of the dioxide. This substance, which is isomeric with
nitrogen dioxide, as ozone is isomeric with oxygen, and has twice as
great a vapour density (46 referred to hydrogen), is formed in greater
quantity the lower the temperature, and crystallises at -10°. The
reasons both of the variation of the colour of the gas (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> gives
colourless and transparent vapours, whilst those of NO<sub>2</sub> are brown and
opaque) and the variation of the vapour density with the variation of
temperature are thus made quite clear; and as at the boiling point a
density 38 was obtained, therefore at that temperature the vapours
consist of a mixture of 79 parts by weight of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> with 21 parts by
weight of NO<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_45_377" id="FNanchor_45_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_377" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It is evident that a decomposition here takes place
the peculiarity of which consists in the fact that the product of decomposition,
NO<sub>2</sub>, is polymerised (<i>i.e.</i> becomes denser, combines with itself)
at a lower temperature; that is, the reaction</p>

<p class="title">N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> = NO<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>is a reversible reaction, and consequently the whole phenomenon represents
a <i>dissociation</i> in a homogeneous gaseous medium, where the
original substance, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and the resultant, NO<sub>2</sub>, are both gases. The
<i>measure of dissociation</i> will be expressed if we find the proportion
of the quantity of the substance decomposed to the whole amount of
the substance. At the boiling point, therefore, the measure of the
decomposition of nitrogen peroxide will be 21 p.c.; at 135° it = 1,
and at 10° it = 0; that is, the N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is not then decomposable.
Consequently the limits of dissociation here are -10° and 135° at
the atmospheric pressure.<a name="FNanchor_46_378" id="FNanchor_46_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_378" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Within the limits of these temperatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the vapours of nitrogen peroxide have not a constant density, but,
on the other hand, above and below these limits definite substances exist.
Thus above 135° N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> has ceased to exist and NO<sub>2</sub> alone remains. It
is evident that at the ordinary temperature there is a partially dissociated
system or mixture of nitrogen peroxide, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and nitrogen dioxide,
NO<sub>2</sub>. In the brown liquid boiling at 22° probably a portion of the
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> has already passed into NO<sub>2</sub>, and it is only the colourless liquid
and crystalline substance at -10° that can be considered as pure
nitrogen peroxide.<a name="FNanchor_47_379" id="FNanchor_47_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_379" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>The above explains the action of nitrogen peroxide on water at low
temperatures. N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> then acts on water like a mixture of the anhydrides
of nitrous and nitric acids. The first, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, may be looked on
as water in which each of the two atoms of hydrogen is replaced by the
radicle NO, while in the second each hydrogen is replaced by the radicle
NO<sub>2</sub>, proper to nitric acid; and in nitrogen peroxide one atom of the
hydrogen of water is replaced by NO and the other by NO<sub>2</sub>, as is seen
from the formulæ&mdash;</p>

<p>In fact, nitrogen peroxide at low temperatures gives with water (ice)
both nitric, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and nitrous, HNO<sub>2</sub>, acids. The latter, as we shall
afterwards see, splits up into water and the anhydride, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. If, however,
warm water act on nitrogen peroxide, only nitric acid and monoxide
of nitrogen are formed: 3NO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = NO + 2NHO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Although NO<sub>2</sub> is not decomposed into N and O even at 500°,
still in many cases it acts as an oxidising agent. Thus, for instance,
it oxidises mercury, converting it into mercurous nitrate, 2NO<sub>2</sub> + Hg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
= HgNO<sub>3</sub> + NO, being itself deoxidised into nitric oxide, into which
the dioxide in many other instances passes, and from which it is
easily formed.<a name="FNanchor_48_380" id="FNanchor_48_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_380" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><i>Nitrous anhydride</i>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, corresponds<a name="FNanchor_49_381" id="FNanchor_49_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_381" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> to nitrous acid, NHO<sub>2</sub>,
which forms a series of salts, the nitrites&mdash;for example, the sodium salt
NaNO<sub>2</sub>, the potassium salt KNO<sub>2</sub>, the ammonium salt (NH<sub>4</sub>)NO<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_50_382" id="FNanchor_50_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_382" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
the silver salt AgNO<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_51_383" id="FNanchor_51_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_383" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> &amp;c. Neither the anhydride nor the hydrate
of the acid is known in a perfectly pure state. The anhydride has only
been obtained as a very unstable substance, and has not yet been fully
investigated; and on attempting to obtain the acid NHO<sub>2</sub> from its
salts, it always gives water and the anhydride, whilst the latter, as an
intermediate oxide, partially or wholly splits up into NO + NO<sub>2</sub>. But
the salts of nitrous acid are distinguished for their great stability.
Potassium nitrate, KNO<sub>3</sub>, may be converted into potassium nitrite by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
depriving it of a portion of its oxygen; for instance, by fusing it (at
not too high a temperature) with metals, such as lead, KNO<sub>3</sub> + Pb
= KNO<sub>2</sub> + PbO.<a name="FNanchor_51_BIS_384" id="FNanchor_51_BIS_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_BIS_384" class="fnanchor">[51 bis]</a> The resultant salt is soluble in water, whilst the
oxide of lead is insoluble. With sulphuric and other acids the solution
of potassium nitrite<a name="FNanchor_52_385" id="FNanchor_52_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_385" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> immediately evolves a brown gas, nitrous anhydride:
2KNO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. The same gas (N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>)
is obtained by passing nitric oxide at 0° through liquid peroxide of
nitrogen,<a name="FNanchor_53_386" id="FNanchor_53_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_386" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> or by heating starch with nitric acid of sp. gr. 1·3. At a
very low temperature it condenses into a blue liquid boiling below 0°,<a name="FNanchor_54_387" id="FNanchor_54_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_387" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>
but then partially decomposing into NO + NO<sub>2</sub>. Nitrous anhydride
possesses a remarkable capacity for oxidising. Ignited bodies burn in it,
nitric acid absorbs it, and then acquires the property of acting on silver
and other metals, even when diluted. <i>Potassium iodide</i> is oxidised by
this gas just as it is by ozone (and by peroxide of hydrogen, chromic
and other acids, but not by dilute nitric acid nor by sulphuric acid),
with the <i>separation of iodine</i>. This iodine may he recognised (<i>see</i>
Ozone, Chapter <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>.) by its turning starch blue. Very small traces
of nitrites may be easily detected by this method. If, for example,
starch and potassium iodide are added to a solution of potassium
nitrite (at first there will be no change, there being no free nitrous acid),
and then sulphuric acid be added, the nitrous acid (or its anhydride)
immediately set free liberates iodine, which produces a blue colour with
the starch. Nitric acid does not act in this manner, but in the presence
of zinc the coloration takes place, which proves the formation of
nitrous acid in the deoxidation of nitric acid.<a name="FNanchor_55_388" id="FNanchor_55_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_388" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Nitrous acid acts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
directly on ammonia, forming nitrogen and water, HNO<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub>
= N<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_56_389" id="FNanchor_56_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_389" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>As nitrous anhydride easily splits up into NO<sub>2</sub> + NO, so, like NO<sub>2</sub>,
with warm water it gives nitric acid and nitric oxide, according to the
equation 3N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 4NO + 2NHO<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Being in a lower degree of oxidation than nitric acid, nitrous acid
and its anhydride are oxidised in solutions by many oxidising substances&mdash;for
example, by potassium permanganate&mdash;into nitric acid.<a name="FNanchor_57_390" id="FNanchor_57_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_390" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p><i>Nitric oxide</i>, NO.&mdash;This permanent gas<a name="FNanchor_58_391" id="FNanchor_58_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_391" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> (that is, unliquefiable by
pressure without the aid of cold) may be obtained from all the above-described
compounds of nitrogen with oxygen. The deoxidation of
nitric acid by metals is the usual method employed for its preparation.
Dilute nitric acid (sp. gr. 1·18, but not stronger, as then N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and
NO<sub>2</sub> are produced) is poured into a flask containing metallic copper.<a name="FNanchor_59_392" id="FNanchor_59_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_392" class="fnanchor">[59]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
The reaction commences at the ordinary temperature. Mercury and
silver also give nitric oxide with nitric acid. In these reactions with
metals one portion of the nitric acid is employed in the oxidation of the
metal, whilst the other, and by far the greater, portion combines with the
metallic oxide so obtained, with formation of the nitrate corresponding
with the metal taken. The first action of the copper on the nitric acid
is thus expressed by the equation</p>

<p class="title">2NHO<sub>3</sub> + 3Cu = H<sub>2</sub>O + 3CuO + 2NO.</p>

<p>The second reaction consists in the formation of copper nitrate&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">6NHO<sub>3</sub> + 3CuO = 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 3Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Nitric oxide is a colourless gas which is only slightly soluble in
water (

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">1</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">20</span>
</span>

of a volume at the ordinary temperature). Reactions of
double decomposition in which nitric oxide readily takes part are not
known&mdash;that is to say, it is an indifferent, not a saline, oxide. Like
the other oxides of nitrogen, it is decomposed into its elements at a red
heat (starting from 900°, at 1,200° 60 per cent. give N<sub>2</sub> and 2N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, but
complete decomposition into N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> only takes place at the melting
point of platinum, Emich 1892). The most characteristic property of
nitric oxide is its capacity for directly and easily combining with oxygen
(owing to the evolution of heat in the combination). With oxygen it
forms nitrous anhydride and nitrogen peroxide, 2NO + O = N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
2NO + O<sub>2</sub> = 2NO<sub>2</sub>. If nitric oxide is mixed with oxygen and immediately
shaken up with caustic potash, it is almost entirely converted
into potassium nitrite; whilst after a certain time, when the formation
of nitric peroxide has already commenced, a mixture of potassium nitrite
and nitrate is obtained. If oxygen is passed into a bell jar filled with nitric
oxide, brown fumes of nitrous anhydride and nitric peroxide are formed,
even in the absence of moisture; these in the presence of water give, as
we already know, nitric acid and nitric oxide, so that in the presence of
an excess of water and oxygen the whole of the nitric oxide is easily and
directly converted into nitric acid. This reaction of the re-formation of
nitric acid from nitric oxide, air, and water, 2NO + H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>3</sub> = 2HNO<sub>3</sub>,
is frequently made use of in practice. The experiment showing the
conversion of nitric oxide into nitric acid is very striking and instructive.
As the intermixture of the oxygen with the oxide of nitrogen proceeds,
the nitric acid formed dissolves in water, and if an excess of oxygen
has not been added the whole of the gas (nitric oxide), being converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
into HNO<sub>3</sub>, is absorbed, and the water entirely fills the bell jar
previously containing the gas.<a name="FNanchor_60_393" id="FNanchor_60_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_393" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> It is evident that nitric oxide<a name="FNanchor_61_394" id="FNanchor_61_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_394" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> in
combining with oxygen has a strong tendency to give the higher
types of nitrogen compounds, which we see in nitric acid, HNO<sub>3</sub> or
NO<sub>2</sub>(OH), in nitric anhydride, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> or (NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O, and in ammonium
chloride, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. If X stand for an atom of hydrogen, or its
equivalents, chlorine, hydroxyl, &amp;c., and if O, which is, according to
the law of substitution, equivalent to H<sub>2</sub>, be indicated by X<sub>2</sub>, then the
three compounds of nitrogen above named should be considered as
compounds of the type or form NX<sub>5</sub>. For example, in nitric acid
X<sub>5</sub> = O<sub>2</sub> + (OH), where O<sub>2</sub> = X<sub>4</sub>, and OH = X; whilst nitric oxide is a
compound of the form NX<sub>2</sub>. Hence this lower form, like lower forms
in general, strives by combination to attain to the higher forms proper to
the compounds of a given element. NX<sub>2</sub> passes consecutively into NX<sub>3</sub>&mdash;namely,
into N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and NHO<sub>2</sub>, NX<sub>4</sub> (for instance NO<sub>2</sub>) and NX<sub>5</sub>.</p>

<p>As the decomposition of nitric oxide begins at temperatures above
900°, many substances burn in it; thus, ignited phosphorus continues
to burn in nitric oxide, but sulphur and charcoal are extinguished
in it. This is due to the fact that the heat evolved in the combustion
of these two substances is insufficient for the decomposition of the nitric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
oxide, whilst the heat developed by burning phosphorus suffices to produce
this decomposition. That nitric oxide really supports combustion,
owing to its being decomposed by the action of heat, is proved by the
fact that strongly ignited charcoal continues to burn in the same nitric
oxide<a name="FNanchor_62_395" id="FNanchor_62_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_395" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> in which a feebly incandescent piece of charcoal is extinguished.</p>

<p>The compounds of nitrogen with oxygen which we have so far considered
may all be prepared from nitric oxide, and may themselves be
converted into it. Thus nitric oxide stands in intimate connection
with them.<a name="FNanchor_63_396" id="FNanchor_63_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_396" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> The passage of nitric oxide into the higher degrees of
oxidation and the converse reaction is employed in practice as a means
for <i>transferring</i> the oxygen of the air to substances capable of being
oxidised. Starting with nitric oxide, it may easily be converted, with
the aid of the oxygen of the atmosphere and water, into nitric acid,
nitrous anhydride, and nitric peroxide, and by their means employed to
oxidise other substances. In this oxidising action nitric oxide is again
formed, and it may again be converted into nitric acid, and so on continuously,
if only oxygen and water be present. Hence the fact, which
at first appears to be a paradox, that by means of a small quantity of
nitric oxide in the presence of oxygen and water it is possible to oxidise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
an indefinitely large quantity of substances which cannot be directly
oxidised either by the action of the atmospheric oxygen or by the
action of nitric oxide itself. The sulphurous anhydride, SO<sub>2</sub>, which
is obtained in the combustion of sulphur and in roasting many metallic
sulphides in the air is an example of this kind. In practice this gas
is obtained by burning sulphur or iron pyrites, the latter being thereby
converted into oxide of iron and sulphurous anhydride. In contact with
the oxygen of the atmosphere this gas does not pass into the higher
degree of oxidation, sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>, and if it does form sulphuric
acid with water and the oxygen of the atmosphere, SO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + O
= H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, it does so very slowly. With nitric acid (and especially with
nitrous acid, but not with nitrogen peroxide) and water, sulphurous
anhydride, on the contrary, very easily forms sulphuric acid, and
especially so when slightly heated (about 40°), the nitric acid (or, better
still, nitrous acid) being converted into nitric oxide&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">3SO<sub>2</sub> + 2NHO<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2NO.</p>

<p>The presence of water is absolutely indispensable here, otherwise
sulphuric anhydride is formed, which combines with the oxides of
nitrogen (nitrous anhydride), forming a crystalline substance containing
oxides of nitrogen (<i>chamber crystals</i>, which will be described in Chapter
XX.) Water destroys this compound, forming sulphuric acid and
separating the oxides of nitrogen. The water must be taken in a
greater quantity than that required for the formation of the hydrate
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, because the latter absorbs oxides of nitrogen. With an excess
of water, however, solution does not take place. If, in the above reaction,
only water, sulphurous anhydride, and nitric or nitrous acid be
taken in a definite quantity, then a definite quantity of sulphuric acid
and nitric oxide will be formed, according to the preceding equation; but
there the reaction ends and the excess of sulphurous anhydride, if there
be any, will remain unchanged. But if we add air and water, then the
nitric oxide will unite with the oxygen to form nitrogen peroxide, and
the latter with water to form nitric and nitrous acids, which again give
sulphuric acid from a fresh quantity of sulphurous anhydride. Nitric
oxide is again formed, which is able to start the oxidation afresh if
there be sufficient air. Thus it is possible with a definite quantity of
nitric oxide to convert an indefinitely large quantity of sulphurous
anhydride into sulphuric acid, water and oxygen only being required.<a name="FNanchor_64_397" id="FNanchor_64_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_397" class="fnanchor">[64]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
This may be easily demonstrated by an experiment on a small scale, if
a certain quantity of nitric oxide be first introduced into a flask, and
sulphurous anhydride, steam, and oxygen be then continually passed in.
Thus the above-described reaction may be expressed in the following
manner:&mdash;</p>

<p class="title"><i>n</i>SO<sub>2</sub> + <i>n</i>O + (<i>n</i> + <i>m</i>)H<sub>2</sub>O + NO = <i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,<i>m</i>H<sub>2</sub>O + NO</p>

<p>if we consider only the original substances and those finally formed. In
this way a definite quantity of nitric oxide may serve for the conversion of
an indefinite quantity of sulphurous anhydride, oxygen, and water into
sulphuric acid. In reality, however, there is a limit to this, because air,
and not pure oxygen, is employed for the oxidation, so that it is necessary
to remove the nitrogen of the air and to introduce a fresh quantity
of air. A certain quantity of nitric oxide will pass away with this
nitrogen, and will in this way be lost.<a name="FNanchor_65_398" id="FNanchor_65_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_398" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>The preceding series of changes serve as the basis of the <i>manufacture
of sulphuric acid</i> or so-called <i>chamber acid</i>. This acid is prepared on a
very large scale in chemical works because it is the cheapest acid whose
action can be applied in a great number of cases. It is therefore used
in immense quantities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>The process is carried on in a series of chambers (or in one divided
by partitions as in fig. <a href="#fig_50">50</a>, which shows the beginning and end of a
chamber) constructed of sheet lead. These chambers are placed one
against the other, and communicate by tubes or special orifices so
placed that the inlet tubes are in the upper portion of the chamber,
and the outlet in the lower and opposite end. The current of steam
and gases necessary for the preparation of the sulphuric acid passes
through these chambers and tubes. The acid as it is formed falls to
the bottom of the chambers or runs down their walls, and flows from
chamber to chamber (from the last towards the first), to permit of
which the partitions do not reach to the bottom. The floor and walls
of the chambers should therefore be made of a material on which
the sulphuric acid will not act. Among the ordinary metals lead is
the only one suitable.<a name="FNanchor_65_BIS_399" id="FNanchor_65_BIS_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_BIS_399" class="fnanchor">[65 bis]</a></p>

<p>For the formation of the sulphuric acid it is necessary to introduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
sulphurous anhydride, steam, air, and nitric acid, or some oxide of
nitrogen, into the chambers. The sulphurous anhydride is produced by
burning sulphur or iron pyrites. This is carried on in the furnace with
four hearths to the left of the drawing. Air is led into the chambers
and furnace through orifices in the furnace doors. The current of air
and oxygen is regulated by opening or closing these orifices to a greater
or less extent. The ingoing draught in the chambers is brought about
by the fact that heated gases and vapours pass into the chambers, whose
temperature is further raised by the reaction itself, and also by the
remaining nitrogen being continually withdrawn from the outlet (above
the tower <span class="smcap">K</span>) by a tall chimney situated near the chambers. Nitric
acid is prepared from a mixture of sulphuric acid and Chili saltpetre,
in the same furnaces in which the sulphurous anhydride is evolved (or
in special furnaces). Not more than 8 parts of nitre are taken to 100
parts of sulphur burnt. On leaving the furnace the vapours of nitric
acid and oxides of nitrogen mixed with air and sulphurous anhydride
first pass along the horizontal tubes <span class="smcap">T</span> into the receiver <span class="smcap">B B</span>, which is
partially cooled by water flowing in on the right-hand side and running
out on the left by <i>o</i>, in order to reduce the temperature of the gases entering
the chamber. The gases then pass up a tower filled with coke, and
shown to the left of the drawing. In this tower are placed lumps of coke
(the residue from the dry distillation of coal), over which sulphuric acid
trickles from the reservoir <span class="smcap">M</span>. This acid has absorbed in the end tower <span class="smcap">K</span>
the oxides of nitrogen escaping from the chamber. This end tower is also
filled with coke, over which a stream of strong sulphuric acid trickles from
the reservoir <span class="smcap">M</span>. The acid spreads over the coke, and, owing to the large
surface offered by the latter, absorbs the greater part of the oxides of
nitrogen escaping from the chambers. The sulphuric acid in passing
down the tower becomes saturated with the oxides of nitrogen, and
flows out at <i>h</i> into a special receiver (in the drawing situated by the
side of the furnaces), from which it is forced up the tubes <i>h&#8242; h&#8242;</i> by steam
pressure into the reservoir <span class="smcap">M</span>, situated above the first tower. The gases
passing through this tower (hot) from the furnace on coming into contact
with the sulphuric acid take up the oxides of nitrogen contained
in it, and these are thus returned to the chamber and again participate
in the reaction. The sulphuric acid left after their extraction flows
into the chambers. Thus, on leaving the first coke tower the sulphurous
anhydride, air, and vapours of nitric acid and of the oxides of nitrogen
pass through the upper tube <i>m</i> into the chamber. Here they come
into contact with steam introduced by lead tubes into various parts of
the chamber. The reaction takes place in the presence of water, the
sulphuric acid falls to the bottom of the chamber, and the same process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
takes place in the following chambers until the whole of the sulphurous
anhydride is consumed. A somewhat greater proportion of air than is
strictly necessary is passed in, in order that no sulphurous anhydride
should be left unaltered for want of sufficient oxygen. The presence
of an excess of oxygen is shown by the colour of the gases escaping
from the last chamber. If they be of a pale colour it indicates an
insufficiency of air (and the presence of sulphurous anhydride), as otherwise
peroxide of nitrogen would be formed. A very dark colour shows
an excess of air, which is also disadvantageous, because it increases the
inevitable loss of nitric oxide by increasing the mass of escaping
gases.<a name="FNanchor_66_400" id="FNanchor_66_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_400" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><i>Nitrous oxide</i>, N<sub>2</sub>O,<a name="FNanchor_67_401" id="FNanchor_67_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_401" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> is similar to water in its volumetric composition.
Two volumes of nitrous oxide are formed from two volumes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
nitrogen and one volume of oxygen, which may be shown by the ordinary
method for the analysis of the oxides of nitrogen (by passing them over
red-hot copper or sodium). In contradistinction to the other oxides of
nitrogen, it is not directly oxidised by oxygen, but it may be obtained
from the higher oxides of nitrogen by the action of certain deoxidising
substances; thus, for example, a mixture of two volumes of nitric oxide
and one volume of sulphurous anhydride if left in contact with water
and spongy platinum is converted into sulphuric acid and nitrous oxide,
2NO + SO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>O. Nitric acid, also, under the action
of certain metals&mdash;for instance, of zinc<a name="FNanchor_68_402" id="FNanchor_68_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_402" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>&mdash;gives nitrous oxide, although
in this case mixed with nitric oxide. The usual method of preparing
nitrous oxide consists in the decomposition of ammonium nitrate by the
aid of heat, because in this case only water and nitrous oxide are formed,
NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>O (a mixture of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl and KNO<sub>3</sub> is sometimes
taken). The decomposition<a name="FNanchor_69_403" id="FNanchor_69_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_403" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> proceeds very easily in an apparatus like
that used for the preparation of ammonia or oxygen&mdash;that is, in a
retort or flask with a gas-conducting tube. The decomposition must,
however, be carried on carefully, as otherwise nitrogen is formed from
the decomposition of the nitrous oxide.<a name="FNanchor_70_404" id="FNanchor_70_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_404" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

The gas first passes though the vessel V, for drying, and then into the pump (a section of the
upper part of the apparatus is given on the left). The piston <i>t</i> of the force pump is moved by the
crank E and fly-wheel turned by hand. The gas is pumped into the iron chamber A, where it is
liquefied. The valve S allows the gas to enter A, but not to escape from it. The chamber and
pump are cooled by the jacket B, filled with ice. When the gas is liquefied the vessel A is unscrewed
from the pump, and the liquid may be poured from it by inverting it and unscrewing the
valve <i>v</i>, when the liquid runs out of the tube <i>x</i>.</p></div>

<p>Nitrous oxide is not a permanent gas (absolute boiling point +36°); it
is easily liquefied by the action of cold under a high pressure; at
15° it may be liquefied by a pressure of about 40 atmospheres. This
gas is usually liquefied by means of the force pump<a name="FNanchor_71_405" id="FNanchor_71_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_405" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> shown in fig.
<a href="#fig_51">51</a>. As it is liquefied with comparative ease, and as the cold produced
by its vaporisation is very considerable,<a name="FNanchor_72_406" id="FNanchor_72_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_406" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> it (as also liquid
carbonic anhydride) is often employed in investigations requiring a low
temperature. Nitrous oxide forms a very mobile, colourless liquid, which
acts on the skin, and is incapable in a cold state of oxidising either
metallic potassium, phosphorus, or carbon; its specific gravity is
slightly less than that of water (0° = 0·910, 10° = 0·856, 35° = 0·60,
39° = 0·45, Villard, 1894). When evaporated under the receiver of an
air-pump, the temperature falls to -100°, and the liquid solidifies
into a snow-like mass, and partially forms transparent crystals. Both
these substances are solid nitrous oxide. Mercury is immediately
solidified in contact with evaporating liquid nitrous oxide.<a name="FNanchor_73_407" id="FNanchor_73_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_407" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>When introduced into the respiratory organs (and consequently
into the blood also) nitrous oxide produces a peculiar kind of intoxication
accompanied by spasmodic movements, and hence this gas,
discovered by Priestley in 1776, received the name of &lsquo;laughing gas.&rsquo;
On a prolonged respiration it produces a state of insensibility (it is an
anæsthetic like chloroform), and is therefore employed in dental and
surgical operations.</p>

<p>Nitrous oxide is easily decomposed into nitrogen and oxygen by the
action of heat, or a series of electric sparks; and this explains why a
number of substances which cannot burn in nitric oxide do so with
great ease in nitrous oxide. In fact, when nitric oxide gives some
oxygen on decomposition, this oxygen immediately unites with a fresh
portion of the gas to form nitric peroxide, whilst nitrous oxide does
not possess this capacity for further combination with oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_74_408" id="FNanchor_74_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_408" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> A

gas, gaseous nitrogen being formed, N<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>. The
volume of the remaining nitrogen is equal to the original volume of
nitrous oxide, and is equal to the volume of hydrogen entering into
combination with the oxygen; hence in this reaction equal volumes of
nitrogen and hydrogen replace each other. Nitrous oxide is also very
easily decomposed by red-hot metals; and sulphur, phosphorus, and
charcoal burn in it, although not so brilliantly as in oxygen. A substance
in burning in nitrous oxide evolves more heat than an equal
quantity burning in oxygen; which most clearly shows that in the
formation of nitrous oxide by the combination of nitrogen with oxygen
there was not an evolution but an absorption of heat, there being no
other source for the excess of heat in the combustion of substances in
nitrous oxide (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_29_358">29</a>). If a given volume of nitrous oxide be
decomposed by a metal&mdash;for instance, sodium&mdash;then there remains,
after cooling and total decomposition, a volume of nitrogen, exactly
equal to that of the nitrous oxide taken; consequently the oxygen is,
so to say, distributed between the atoms of nitrogen without producing
an increase in the volume of the nitrogen.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_326" id="Footnote_1_326"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_326"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The ammonia in the air, water, and soil proceeds from the decomposition of the
nitrogenous substances of plants and animals, and also probably from the reduction of
nitrates. Ammonia is always formed in the rusting of iron. Its formation in this case
depends in all probability on the decomposition of water, and on the action of the hydrogen
at the moment of its evolution on the nitric acid contained in the air (Cloez), or on
the formation of ammonium nitrite, which takes place under many circumstances. The
evolution of vapours of ammonia compounds is sometimes observed in the vicinity of
volcanoes. At a red heat nitrogen combines directly with B Ca Mg, and with many other
metals, and these compounds, when heated with a caustic alkali, or in the presence of
water, give ammonia (<i>see</i> Chapter XIV., Note <a href="#Footnote_14_841">14</a>, and Chapter XVII., Note 12). These
are examples of the indirect combination of nitrogen with hydrogen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_327" id="Footnote_2_327"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_327"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> If a silent discharge or a series of electric sparks be passed through ammonia gas,
it is decomposed into nitrogen and hydrogen. This is a phenomenon of dissociation;
therefore, a series of sparks do not totally decompose the ammonia, but leave a certain
portion undecomposed. One volume of nitrogen and three volumes of hydrogen are
obtained from two volumes of ammonia decomposed. Ramsay and Young (1884) investigated
the decomposition of NH<sub>3</sub> under the action of heat, and showed that at 500°, 1&frac12; p.c.
is decomposed, at 600° about 18 p.c., at 800° 65 p.c., but these results were hardly free
from the influence of &lsquo;contact.&rsquo; The <i>presence</i> of free ammonia&mdash;that is, ammonia not
combined with acids&mdash;in a gas or aqueous solution may be recognised by its characteristic
smell. But many ammonia salts do not possess this smell. However, on the addition
of an alkali (for instance, caustic lime, potash, or soda), they evolve ammonia gas, especially
when heated. The presence of ammonia may be made visible by introducing a substance
moistened with strong hydrochloric acid into its neighbourhood. A white cloud,
or visible white vapour, then makes its appearance. This depends on the fact that both
ammonia and hydrochloric acid are volatile, and on coming into contact with each other
produce solid sal-ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which forms a cloud. This test is usually made by
dipping a glass rod into hydrochloric acid, and holding it over the vessel from which the
ammonia is evolved. With small amounts of ammonia this test is, however, untrustworthy,
as the white vapour is scarcely observable. In this case it is best to take paper
moistened with mercurous nitrate, HgNO<sub>3</sub>. This paper turns black in the presence
of ammonia, owing to the formation of a black compound of ammonia with mercurous
oxide. The smallest traces of ammonia (for instance, in river water) may be detected
by means of the so-called Nessler's reagent, containing a solution of mercuric chloride
and potassium iodide, which forms a brown coloration or precipitate with the smallest
quantities of ammonia. It will be useful here to give the thermochemical data (in
thousands of units of heat, according to Thomsen), or the quantities of heat <i>evolved</i> in
the formation of ammonia and its compounds in quantities expressed by their formulæ.
Thus, for instance, (N + H<sub>3</sub>) 26·7 indicates that 14 grams of nitrogen in combining with
3 grams of hydrogen develop sufficient heat to raise the temperature of 26·7 kilograms of
water 1°. (NH<sub>3</sub> + nH<sub>2</sub>O) 8·4 (heat of solution); (NH<sub>3</sub>,nH<sub>2</sub>O + HCl,nH<sub>2</sub>O) 12·3;
(N + H<sub>4</sub> + Cl) 90·6; (NH<sub>3</sub> + HCl) 41·9.</p></div>

by weight of slaked lime and finely-powdered sal-ammoniac, the neck of the flask
being connected with an arrangement for drying the gas obtained. In this instance
neither calcium chloride nor sulphuric acid can be used for drying the gas, since both
these substances absorb ammonia, and therefore solid caustic potash, which is capable of
retaining the water, is employed. The gas-conducting tube leading from the desiccating
apparatus is introduced into a mercury bath, if dry gaseous ammonia be required, because
water cannot be employed in collecting ammonia gas. Ammonia was first obtained in
this dry state by Priestley, and its composition was investigated by Berthollet at the end
of the last century. Oxide of lead mixed with sal-ammoniac (Isambert) evolves ammonia
with still greater ease than lime. The cause and process of the decomposition are almost
the same, 2PbO + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl = Pb<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + 2NH<sub>3</sub>. Lead oxychloride is (probably)

<p>This is evident from the fact that its absolute boiling point lies at about +130° (Chapter
II., Note <a href="#Footnote_29_153">29</a>). It may therefore be liquefied by pressure alone at the ordinary, and even
at much higher temperatures. The latent heat of evaporation of 17 parts by weight
of ammonia equals 4,400 units of heat, and hence liquid ammonia may be employed
for the production of cold. Strong aqueous solutions of ammonia, which in parting with
their ammonia act in a similar manner, are not unfrequently employed for this purpose.
Suppose a saturated solution of ammonia to be contained in a closed vessel furnished with
a receiver. If the ammoniacal solution be heated, the ammonia, with a small quantity
of water, will pass off from the solution, and in accumulating in the apparatus will
produce a considerable pressure, and will therefore liquefy in the cooler portions of the
receiver. Hence liquid ammonia will be obtained in the receiver. The heating of the
vessel containing the aqueous solution of ammonia is then stopped. After having been
heated it contains only water, or a solution poor in ammonia. When once it begins to cool
the ammonia vapours commence dissolving in it, the space becomes rarefied, and a rapid
vaporisation of the liquefied ammonia left in the receiver takes place. In evaporating in
the receiver it will cause the temperature in it to fall considerably, and will itself pass into
the aqueous solution. In the end, the same ammoniacal solution as originally taken is
re-obtained. Thus, in this case, on heating the vessel the pressure increases by itself,
and on cooling it diminishes, so that here heat directly replaces mechanical work. This
is the principle of the simplest forms of <i>Carré's ice-making machines</i>, shown in fig. <a href="#fig_44">44</a>.
C is a vessel made of boiler plates into which the saturated solution of ammonia is
poured; m is a tube conducting the ammonia vapour to the receiver A. All parts of
the apparatus should be hermetically joined together, and should be able to withstand
a pressure reaching ten atmospheres. The apparatus should be freed from air, which
would otherwise hinder the liquefaction of the ammonia. The process is carried on as
follows:&mdash;The apparatus is first so inclined that any liquid remaining in A may flow
into C. The vessel C is then placed upon a stove F, and heated until the thermometer <i>t</i>
indicates a temperature of 130° C. During this time the ammonia has been expelled from
C, and has liquefied in A. In order to facilitate the liquefaction, the receiver A should
be immersed in a tank of water R (<i>see</i> the left-hand drawing in fig. <a href="#fig_44">44</a>). After about
half an hour, when it may be supposed that the ammonia has been expelled, the fire is
removed from under C, and this is now immersed in the tank of water R. The apparatus
is represented in this position in the right-hand drawing of fig. <a href="#fig_44">44</a>. The liquefied ammonia
then evaporates, and passes over into the water in C. This causes the temperature
of A to fall considerably. The substance to be refrigerated is placed in a vessel G, in the
cylindrical space inside the receiver A. The refrigeration is also kept on for about half
an hour, and with an apparatus of ordinary dimensions (containing about two litres
of ammonia solution), five kilograms of ice are produced by the consumption of one
kilogram of coal. In industrial works more complicated types of Carré's machines are
employed.</p></div>

20° the compound 2AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub>. The tension of the ammonia evolved from the latter
substance is equal to the atmospheric pressure at 68°, whilst for AgCl,3NH<sub>3</sub> the
pressures are equal at about 20°; consequently, at higher temperatures it is greater
than the atmospheric pressure, whilst at lower temperatures the ammonia is absorbed
and forms this compound. Consequently, all the phenomena of dissociation are here
clearly to be observed. Joannis and Croisier (1894) investigated similar compounds
with AgBr, AgI, AgCN and AgNO<sub>3</sub>, and found that they all give definite compounds
with NH<sub>3</sub>, for instance AgBr,3NH<sub>3</sub>, 2AgBr,3NH<sub>3</sub> and AgBr,2NH<sub>3</sub>; they are all colourless,
solid substances which decompose under the atmospheric pressure at +3·5, +34° and
+51°.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_334" id="Footnote_9_334"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_334"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> The liquefaction of ammonia may be accomplished without an increase of pressure,
by means of refrigeration alone, in a carefully prepared mixture of ice and calcium
chloride (because the absolute boiling point of NH<sub>3</sub> is high, about +130°). It may even
take place in the severe frosts of a Russian winter. The application of liquid ammonia
as a motive power for engines forms a problem which has to a certain extent been solved
by the French engineer Tellier.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_335" id="Footnote_10_335"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_335"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The combustion of ammonia in oxygen may be effected by the aid of platinum.
A small quantity of an aqueous solution of ammonia, containing about 20 p.c. of the gas,
is poured into a wide-necked beaker of about one litre capacity. A gas-conducting tube
about 10 mm. in diameter, and supplying oxygen, is immersed in the aqueous solution of
ammonia. But before introducing the gas an incandescent platinum spiral is placed in
the beaker; the ammonia in the presence of the platinum is oxidised and burns, whilst
the platinum wire becomes still more incandescent. The solution of ammonia is heated,
and oxygen passed through the solution. The oxygen, as it bubbles off from the ammonia
solution, carries with it a part of the ammonia, and this mixture explodes on coming
into contact with the incandescent platinum. This is followed by a certain cooling
effect, owing to the combustion ceasing, but after a short interval this is renewed, so
that one feeble explosion follows after another. During the period of oxidation without
explosion, white vapours of ammonium nitrite and red-brown vapours of oxides of nitrogen
make their appearance, while during the explosion there is complete combustion and
consequently water and nitrogen are formed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_336" id="Footnote_11_336"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_336"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> This may be verified by their densities. Nitrogen is 14 times denser than hydrogen,
and ammonia is 8&frac12; times. If 3 volumes of hydrogen with 1 volume of nitrogen gave
4 volumes of ammonia, then these 4 volumes would weigh 17 times as much as 1 volume
of hydrogen; consequently 1 volume of ammonia would be 4&frac14; times heavier than the
same volume of hydrogen. But if these 4 volumes only give 2 volumes of ammonia,
the latter will be 8&frac12; times as dense as hydrogen, which is found to be actually the
case.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_337" id="Footnote_12_337"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_337"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Aqueous solutions of ammonia are lighter than water, and at 15°, taking water at
4° = 10,000, their specific gravity, as dependent on <i>p</i>, or the percentage amount (by
weight) of ammonia, is given by the expression <i>s</i> = 9,992 - 42·5<i>p</i> + 0·21<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>; for instance, with
10 p.c. <i>s</i> = 9,587. If <i>t</i> represents the temperature between the limits of +10° and +20°, then
the expression (15 - <i>t</i>)(1·5 + 0·14<i>p</i>) must be added to the formula for the specific gravity.
Solutions containing more than 24 p.c. have not been sufficiently investigated in respect
to the variation of their specific gravity. It is, however, easy to obtain more concentrated
solutions, and at 0° solutions approaching NH<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O (48·6 p.c. NH<sub>3</sub>) in their composition,
and of sp. gr. 0·85, may be prepared. But such solutions give up the bulk of their
ammonia at the ordinary temperature, so that more than 24 p.c. NH<sub>3</sub> is rarely contained
in solution. Ammoniacal solutions containing a considerable amount of ammonia give
ice-like crystals which seem to contain ammonia at temperatures far below 0° (for instance,
an 8 p.c. solution at -14°, the strongest solutions at -48°). The whole of the ammonia
may be expelled from a solution by heating, even at a comparatively low temperature;
hence on heating aqueous solutions containing ammonia a very strong solution of
ammonia is obtained in the distillate. Alcohol, ether, and many other liquids are also
capable of dissolving ammonia. Solutions of ammonia, when exposed to the atmosphere,
give off a part of their ammonia in accordance with the laws of the solution of gases in
liquids, which we have already considered. But the ammoniacal solutions at the same
time absorb carbonic anhydride from the air, and ammonium carbonate remains in the
solution.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 46.&mdash;Apparatus for preparing solutions of ammonia.</p></div>

<p>Solutions of ammonia are required both for laboratory and factory operations, and have
therefore to be frequently prepared. For this purpose the arrangement shown in fig. <a href="#fig_46">46</a>
is employed in the laboratory. In works the same arrangement is used, only on a larger
scale (with earthenware or metallic vessels). The gas is prepared in the retort, from
whence it is led into the two-necked globe A, and then through a series of Woulfe's
bottles, B, C, D, E. The impurities spurting over collect in A, and the gas is dissolved
in B, but the solution soon becomes saturated, and a purer (washed) ammonia passes
over into the following vessels, in which only a pure solution is obtained. The bent
funnel tube in the retort preserves the apparatus from the possibility both of the pressure
of the gas evolved in it becoming too great (when the gas escapes through it into
the air), and also from the pressure incidentally falling too low (for instance, owing to a
cooling effect, or from the reaction stopping). If this takes place, the air passes into the
retort, otherwise the liquid from B would be drawn into A. The safety tubes in each
Woulfe's bottle, open at both ends, and immersed in the liquid, serve for the same purpose.
Without them, in case of an accidental stoppage in the evolution of so soluble a gas as
ammonia, the solution would be sucked from one vessel to another&mdash;for instance, from E
into D, &amp;c. In order to clearly see the necessity for <i>safety tubes</i> in a gas apparatus,
it must be remembered that the <i>gaseous pressure</i> in the interior of the arrangement must
exceed the atmospheric pressure by the height of the sum of the columns of liquid
through which the gas has to pass.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_338" id="Footnote_13_338"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_338"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The analogy between the ammonium and sodium salts might seem to be destroyed
by the fact that the latter are formed from the alkali or oxide and an acid, with the separation
of water, whilst the ammonium salts are directly formed from ammonia and an
acid, without the separation of water; but the analogy is restored if we compare soda to
ammonia water, and liken caustic soda to a compound of ammonia with water. Then the
very preparation of ammonium salts from such a hydrate of ammonia will completely resemble
the preparation of sodium salts from soda. We may cite as an example the action
of hydrochloric acid on both substances.</p>

<p>Just as in soda the hydroxyl or aqueous radicle OH is replaced by chlorine, so it is in

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_339" id="Footnote_14_339"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_339"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Weyl (1864) by subjecting sodium to the action of ammonia at the ordinary temperature
and under considerable pressures, obtained a liquid, which was subsequently
investigated by Joannis (1889), who confirmed the results obtained by Weyl. At 0° and
the atmospheric pressure the composition of this substance is Na + 5·3NH<sub>3</sub>. The
removal (at 0°) of ammonia from the liquid gives a solid copper-red body having the
composition NH<sub>3</sub>Na. The determination of the molecular weight of this substance by
the fall of the tension of liquid ammonia gave N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>. It is, therefore, free ammonium
in which one H is replaced by Na. The compound with potassium, obtained under the
same conditions, proved to have an analogous composition. By the decomposition of
NH<sub>3</sub>Na at the ordinary temperature, Joannis (1891) obtained hydrogen and sodium-amide
NH<sub>2</sub>Na in small colourless crystals which were soluble in water. The addition of
liquid ammonia to metallic sodium and a saturated solution of sodium chloride, gives
NH<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>Cl, and this substance is sal-ammoniac, in which H<sub>2</sub> is replaced by Na<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>If pure oxygen be passed through a solution of these compounds in ammonia at a
temperature of about -50°, it is seen that the gas is rapidly absorbed. The liquid gradually
loses its dark red colour and becomes lighter, and when it has become quite colourless
a gelatinous precipitate is thrown down. After the removal of the ammonia, this
precipitate dissolves easily in water with a considerable evolution of heat, but without
giving off any gaseous products. The composition of the sodium compound thus obtained
is NH<sub>2</sub>Na<sub>2</sub>HO, which shows that it is a hydrate of bisodium-ammonium. Thus, although
free ammonium has not been obtained, still a sodium substitution product of it is known
which corresponds to it as a salt to a hydrate. Ammonium amalgam was originally
obtained in exactly the same way as sodium amalgam (Davy); namely, a piece of sal-ammoniac
was taken, and moistened with water (in order to render it a conductor of
electricity). A cavity was made in it, into which mercury was poured, and it was laid on
a sheet of platinum connected with the positive pole of a galvanic battery, while the
negative pole was put into connection with the mercury. On passing a current the
mercury increased considerably in volume, and became plastic, whilst preserving its
metallic appearance, just as would be the case were the sal-ammoniac replaced by a lump
of a sodium salt or of many other metals. In the analogous decomposition of common
metallic salts, the metal contained in a given salt separates out at the negative pole, immersed
in mercury, by which the metal is dissolved. A similar phenomenon is observed
in the case of sal-ammoniac; the elements of ammonium, NH<sub>4</sub>, in this case are also
collected in the mercury, and are retained by it for a certain time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_340" id="Footnote_15_340"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_340"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> We may mention, however, that under particular conditions hydrogen is also
capable of forming an amalgam resembling the amalgam of ammonium. If an amalgam
of zinc be shaken up with an aqueous solution of platinum chloride, without access of
air, then a spongy mass is formed which easily decomposes, with the evolution of
hydrogen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_341" id="Footnote_16_341"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_341"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> We saw above that the solubility of ammonia in water at low temperatures attains
to the molecular ratio NH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O, in which these substances are contained in caustic
ammonia, and perhaps it may be possible at exceedingly low temperatures to obtain
ammonium hydroxide, NH<sub>4</sub>HO, in a solid form. Regarding solutions as dissociated
definite compounds, we should see a confirmation of this view in the property shown by
ammonia of being extremely soluble in water, and in so doing of approaching to the
limit NH<sub>4</sub>HO.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_342" id="Footnote_17_342"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_342"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> In confirmation of the truth of this conclusion we may cite the remarkable fact
that there exist, in a free state and as comparatively stable compounds, a series of alkaline
hydroxides, NR<sub>4</sub>HO, which are perfectly analogous to ammonium hydroxide, and
present a striking resemblance to it and to sodium hydroxide, with the only difference
that the hydrogen in NH<sub>4</sub>HO is replaced by complex groups, R = CH<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, &amp;c., for
instance N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>HO. Details will be found in organic chemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_343" id="Footnote_18_343"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_343"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> The fact that ammoniacal salts are decomposed when ignited, and not simply
sublimed, may be proved by a direct experiment with sal-ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which in a
state of vapour is decomposed into ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, and hydrochloric acid, HCl, as will
be explained in the <a href="#Page_299">following chapter</a>. The readiness with which ammonium salts decompose
is seen from the fact that a solution of ammonium oxalate is decomposed with the
evolution of ammonia even at -1°. Dilute solutions of ammonium salts, when boiled
give aqueous vapour having an alkaline reaction, owing to the presence of free ammonia
given off from the salt.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_344" id="Footnote_19_344"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_344"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> Isambert studied the dissociation of ammoniacal compounds, as we have seen in
Note 8, and showed that at low temperatures many salts are able to combine with a
still greater amount of ammonia, which proves an entire analogy with hydrates; and as
in this case it is easy to isolate the definite compounds, and as the least possible tension
of ammonia is greater than that of water, therefore the ammoniacal compounds present
a great and peculiar interest, as a means for explaining the nature of aqueous solutions
and as a confirmation of the hypothesis of the formation of definite compounds in
them; for these reasons we shall frequently refer to these compounds in the further exposition
of this work.</p></div>

NHHCl, has apparently been obtained (1890) by Maumené by igniting the double bichloride
of platinum and ammonium chloride, PtCl<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl = Pt + 2HCl + NHHCl. It is
soluble in water, and crystallises from its solution in hexagonal rhombic prisms. It gives
a double salt with FeCl<sub>3</sub> of the composition FeCl<sub>3</sub>3NHHCl. The salt NHHCl is similar
(isomeric) with the first possible product of the metalepsis of ammonia, NH<sub>2</sub>Cl, although
it does not resemble it in any of its properties.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_347" id="Footnote_21_347"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_347"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> Free <i>amidogen</i> or <i>hydrazine</i>, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, or 2NH<sub>2</sub>, was prepared by Curtius (1887) by
means of ethyl diazoacetate, or triazoacetic acid. Curtius and Jay (1889) showed that
triazoacetic acid, CHN<sub>2</sub>.COOH (the formula should be tripled), when heated with water or a
mineral acid, gives (quantitatively) oxalic acid and amidogen (hydrazine), CHN<sub>2</sub>.COOH
+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O = C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> (empirically), the oxygen of the water replaces the nitrogen
of the azoacetic acid. The amidogen is thus obtained in the form of a salt. With
acids, amidogen forms very stable salts of the two types N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>HX and N_[2]H<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub>, as,
for example, with HCl, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c. These salts are easily crystallised; in acid solutions
they act as powerful reducing agents, evolving nitrogen; when ignited they are decomposed
into ammoniacal salts, nitrogen, and hydrogen; with nitrites they evolve nitrogen.
The sulphate N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is sparingly soluble in cold water (3 parts in 100 of water),
but is very soluble in hot water; its specific gravity is 1·378, it fuses at 254° with decomposition.
The hydrochloride N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,2HCl crystallises in octahedra, is very soluble
in water, but not in alcohol; it fuses at 198°, evolving hydrogen chloride and forming
the salt N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>HCl; when rapidly heated it decomposes with an explosion; with platinic
chloride it immediately evolves nitrogen, forming platinous chloride. By the action of
alkalis the salts N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,2HX give <i>hydrate of amidogen</i>, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, which is a fuming
liquid (specific gravity 1·03), boiling at 119°, almost without odour, and whose aqueous
solution corrodes glass and india-rubber, has an alkaline taste and poisonous properties.
The reducing capacities of the hydrate are clearly seen from the fact that it reduces the
metals platinum and silver from their solutions. With mercuric oxide it explodes. It
reacts directly with the aldehydes RO, forming N<sub>2</sub>R<sub>2</sub> and water; for example, with benzaldehydes
it gives the very stable insoluble <i>benzalazine</i> (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CHN)<sub>2</sub> of a yellow colour.
We may add that hydrazine often forms double salts; for example, MgSO<sub>4</sub>N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
or KClN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>HCl, and that it is also formed by the action of nitrous acid upon aldehyde-ammonia.
The products of the substitution of the hydrogen in hydrazine by hydrocarbon
groups R (R = CH<sub>3</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, &amp;c.) were obtained before hydrazine itself; for
example, NHRNH<sub>2</sub>, NR<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>2</sub>, and (NRH)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The heat of solution of the sulphuric acid salt (1 part in 200 and 300 parts of water
at 10°·8) is equal to -8·7 C. According to Berthelot and Matigon (1892), the heat of
neutralisation of hydrazine by sulphuric acid is +5·5 C and by hydrochloric acid +5·2 C.
Thus hydrazine is a very feeble base, for its heat of saturation is not only lower than
that of ammonia (+12·4 C. for HCl), but even below that of hydroxylamine (+9·3 C.)
The heat of formation from the elements of hydrated hydrazine -9·5 C was deduced
from the heat of combustion, determined by burning N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in a calorimetric bomb,
+127·7 C. Thus hydrazine is an endothermal compound; its passage into ammonia by
the combination of hydrogen is accompanied by the evolution of 51·5 C. In the presence
of an acid these figures were greater by +14·4 C. Hence the direct converse passage
from ammonia into hydrazine is impossible. As regards the passage of hydroxylamine
into hydrazine, it would be accompanied by the evolution of heat (+21·5 C.) in an aqueous
solution.</p>

<p>Amidogen must be regarded as a compound which stands to ammonia in the same
relation as hydrogen peroxide stands to water. Water, H(OH), gives, according to the
law of substitution, as was clearly to be expected, (OH)(OH)&mdash;that is, peroxide of hydrogen
is the free radicle of water (hydroxyl). So also ammonia, H(NH<sub>2</sub>), forms hydrazine,
(NH<sub>2</sub>)(NH<sub>2</sub>)&mdash;that is, the free radicle of ammonia, NH<sub>2</sub>, or amidogen. In the case of
phosphorus a similar substance, as we shall afterwards see, has long been known under
the name of liquid phosphuretted hydrogen, P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_BIS_348" id="Footnote_21_BIS_348"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_BIS_348"><span class="label">[21 bis]</span></a> In practice, the applications of ammonia are very varied. The use of ammonia as
a stimulant, in the forms of the so-called &lsquo;smelling salts&rsquo; or of spirits of hartshorn, in
cases of faintness, &amp;c., is known to everyone. The volatile carbonate of ammonium, or a
mixture of an ammonium salt with an alkali, is also employed for this purpose. Ammonia
also produces a well-known stimulating effect when rubbed on the skin, for which reason
it is sometimes employed for external applications. Thus, for instance, the well-known
volatile salve is prepared from any liquid oil shaken up with a solution of ammonia. A
portion of the oil is thus transformed into a soapy substance. The solubility of greasy
substances in ammonia, which proceeds from the formation both of emulsions and soaps,
explains its use in extracting grease spots. It is also employed as an external application
for stings from insects, and for bites from poisonous snakes, and in general in medicine.
It is also remarkable that in cases of drunkenness a few drops of ammonia in water taken
internally rapidly renders a person sober. A large quantity of ammonia is used in
dyeing, either for the solution of certain dyes&mdash;for example, carmine&mdash;or for changing
the tints of others, or else for neutralising the action of acids. It is also employed in
the manufacture of artificial pearls. For this purpose the small scales of a peculiar
small fish are mixed with ammonia, and the liquid so obtained is blown into small hollow
glass beads shaped like pearls.</p>

<p>In nature and the arts, however, ammonium salts, and not free ammonia, are most
frequently employed. In this form a portion of that <i>nitrogen</i> which is necessary for the
formation of albuminous substances is <i>supplied to plants</i>. Owing to this, a large
quantity of ammonium sulphate is now employed as a fertilising substance. But the same
effect may be produced by nitre, or by animal refuse, which in decomposing gives
ammonia. For this reason, an ammoniacal (hydrogen) compound may be introduced into
the soil in the spring which will be converted into a nitrate (oxygen salt) in the summer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_349" id="Footnote_22_349"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_349"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> As certain basic hydrates form peculiar compounds with ammonia, in some cases
it happens that the first portions of ammonia added to a solution of a salt produce a precipitate,
whilst the addition of a fresh quantity of ammonia dissolves this precipitate if
the ammoniacal compound of the base be soluble in water. This, for example, takes
place with the copper salts. But alumina does not dissolve under these circumstances.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_350" id="Footnote_23_350"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_350"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> When the element chlorine, as we shall afterwards more fully learn, replaces the
element hydrogen, the reaction by which such an exchange is accomplished proceeds
as a substitution, AH + Cl<sub>2</sub> = ACl + HCl, so that two substances, AH and chlorine, react
on each other, and two substances, ACl and HCl, are formed; and further, two molecules
react on each other, and two others are formed. The reaction proceeds very easily, but
the substitution of one element, <i>A</i>, by another, <i>X</i>, does not always proceed with such
ease, clearness, or simplicity. The substitution between oxygen and hydrogen is very
rarely accomplished by the reaction of the free elements, but the substitution between
these elements, one for another, forms the most common case of oxidation and reduction.
In speaking of the law of substitution, I have in view the substitution of the elements
one by another, and not the direct reaction of substitution. The law of substitution
determines the cycle of the combinations of a given element, if a few of its compounds
(for instance, the hydrogen compounds) be known. A development of the conceptions
of the law of substitution may be found in my lecture given at the Royal Institution in
London, 1889.</p></div>

than those corresponding with water should be looked for. They should possess the

similar acids present these properties, as we shall see in describing them.</p></div>

<p>Thus in this case the nitric acid is deoxidised, not directly into nitrogen, but into hydroxylamine.
Hydroxylamine is also formed by passing nitric oxide, NO, into a mixture of tin
and hydrochloric acid&mdash;that is, by the action of the hydrogen evolved on the nitric oxide,
NO + 3H + HCl = NH<sub>4</sub>OCl&mdash;and in many other cases. According to Lossen's method, a
mixture of 30 parts of ethyl nitrate, 120 parts of tin, and 40 parts of a solution of hydrochloric
acid of sp. gr. 1·06 are taken. After a certain time the reaction commences
spontaneously. When the reaction has ceased the tin is separated by means of hydrogen
sulphide, the solution is evaporated, and a large amount of sal-ammoniac is thus obtained
(owing to the further action of hydrogen on the hydroxylamine compound, the hydrogen
taking up oxygen from it and forming water); a solution ultimately remains containing
the hydroxylamine salt; this salt is dissolved in anhydrous alcohol and purified by the
addition of platinum chloride, which precipitates any ammonium salt still remaining in
the solution. After concentrating the alcoholic solution the hydroxylamine hydrochloride
separates in crystals. This substance melts at about 150°, and in so doing decomposes
into nitrogen, hydrogen chloride, water, and sal-ammoniac. A sulphuric acid compound
of hydroxylamine may be obtained by mixing a solution of the above salt
with sulphuric acid. The sulphate is also soluble in water like the hydrochloride;
this shows that hydroxylamine, like ammonia itself, forms a series of salts in which one
acid may be substituted for another. It might he expected that by mixing a strong
solution of a hydroxylamine salt with a solution of a caustic alkali hydroxylamine itself
would be liberated, just as an ammonia salt under these circumstances evolves ammonia;
but the liberated hydroxylamine is immediately decomposed with the formation of nitrogen
and ammonia (and probably nitrous oxide), 3NH<sub>3</sub>O = NH<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>. Dilute
solutions give the same reaction, although very slowly, but by decomposing a solution of
the sulphate with barium hydroxide a certain amount of hydroxylamine is obtained in
solution (it is partly decomposed). Hydroxylamine in aqueous solution, like ammonia,
precipitates basic hydrates, and it deoxidises the oxides of copper, silver, and other
metals. Free hydroxylamine was obtained by Lobry de Bruyn (1891). It is a solid,
colourless, crystalline substance, without odour, which does not melt below 27°. It has
the property of dissolving metallic salts; for instance, sodium chloride. Hydroxylamine,
when rapidly heated with platinum, decomposes with a flash and the formation of a
yellow flame. It is almost insoluble in ordinary solvents like chloroform, benzine, acetic
ether, and carbon bisulphide. Its aqueous solutions are tolerably stable, contain up to
60 per cent. (sp. gr. 1·15 at 20°), and may be kept for many weeks without undergoing any
change. Lobry de Bruyn used the hydrochloric salt to prepare pure hydroxylamine.
The salt was first treated with sodium methylate (CH<sub>3</sub>NaO), and then methyl alcohol was
added to the mixture. The precipitated sodium chloride was separated from the solution
by filtration. (The methyl alcohol is added to prevent the precipitated chloride of sodium
from coating the insoluble hydrochloric salt of hydroxylamine.) The methyl alcohol was
driven off under a pressure 150&ndash;200 mm., and after extracting a further portion of methyl
alcohol by ether and several fractional distillations, a solution was obtained containing
70 per cent. of free hydroxylamine, 8 per cent. water, 9·9 per cent. chloride of sodium, and
12·1 per cent. of the hydrochloric salt of hydroxylamine. Pure free hydroxylamine,
NH<sub>3</sub>O, is obtained by distilling under a pressure of 60 mm.; it then boils at 70°, and
solidifies in a condenser cooled to 0° in the form of long needles. It melts at 33°, boils
at 58° under a pressure of 22 mm., and has a sp. gr. of about 1·235 (Brühl). Under the
action of NaHO it gives NH<sub>3</sub> and NHO<sub>2</sub> or N<sub>2</sub>O, and forms nitric acid (Kolotoff, 1893)
under the action of oxidising agents. Hydroxylamine is obtained in a great number of
cases, for instance by the action of tin on dilute nitric acid, and also by the action of
zinc on ethyl nitrate and dilute hydrochloric acid, &amp;c. The relation between hydroxylamine,
NH<sub>2</sub>(OH), and nitrous acid, NO(OH), which is so clear in the sense of the law of
substitutions, becomes a reality in those cases when reducing agents act on salts of
nitrous acid. Thus Raschig (1888) proposed the following method for the preparation of
the hydroxylamine sulphate. A mixture of strong solutions of potassium nitrite, KNO<sub>2</sub>,
and hydroxide, KHO, in molecular proportions, is prepared and cooled. An excess of
sulphurous anhydride is then passed into the mixture, and the solution boiled for a long
time. A mixture of the sulphates of potassium and hydroxylamine is thus obtained:
KNO<sub>2</sub> + KHO + 2SO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = NH<sub>2</sub>(OH),H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The salts may be separated
from each other by crystallisation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_BIS_353" id="Footnote_25_BIS_353"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_BIS_353"><span class="label">[25 bis]</span></a> In order to illustrate the application of the law of substitution to a given case,
and to show the connection between ammonia and the oxides of nitrogen, let us consider
the possible products of an oxygen and hydroxyl substitution in caustic ammonia,
NH<sub>4</sub>(OH). It is evident that the substitution of H by OH can give: (1) NH<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>;
(2) NH<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>; (3) NH(OH)<sub>4</sub>; and (4) N(OH)<sub>5</sub>. They should all, like caustic ammonia
itself, easily part with water and form products (hydroxylic) of the oxidation of ammonia.
The first of them is the hydrate of hydroxylamine, NH<sub>2</sub>(OH) + H<sub>2</sub>O; the second,
NH(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O (and also the substance NH(OH)<sub>4</sub> or NH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), containing, as it does,
both hydrogen and oxygen, is able to part with all its hydrogen in the form of water
(which could not be done by the first product, since it contained too little oxygen), forming,
as the ultimate product, 2NH<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub> - 5H<sub>2</sub>O = N<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;that is, it corresponds with nitrous
oxide, or the lower degree of the oxidation of nitrogen. So, also, nitrous anhydride
corresponds with the third of the above products, 2NH(OH)<sub>4</sub> - 5H<sub>2</sub>O = N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and nitric
anhydride with the fourth, 2N(OH)<sub>5</sub> - 5H<sub>2</sub>O = N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. As, in these three equations, two
molecules of the substitution products (-5H<sub>2</sub>O) are taken, it is also possible to combine
two different products in one equation. For instance, the third and fourth products:
NH(OH)<sub>4</sub> + N(OH)<sub>5</sub> - 5H<sub>2</sub>O corresponds to N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> or 2NO<sub>2</sub>, that is, to peroxide of nitrogen.
Thus all the five (see later) oxides of nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>O, NO, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, may be
deduced from ammonia. The above may be expressed in a general form by the equation
(it should be remarked that the composition of all the substitution products of caustic
ammonia may be expressed by NH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>5 - <i>a</i></sub>, where <i>a</i> varies between 0 and 4):</p>

<p class="title">NH<sub>5</sub>O<sub>5-<i>a</i></sub> + NH<sub>5</sub>O<sub>5-<i>b</i></sub> - 5H<sub>2</sub>O = N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5-(<i>a</i>+<i>b</i>)</sub>,</p>

<p>where <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> can evidently be not greater than 5; when <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = 5 we have N<sub>2</sub>&mdash;nitrogen,
when = 4 we have N<sub>2</sub>O nitrous oxide; when <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = 3 we have N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or NO&mdash;nitric oxide,
and so on to N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, when <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = 0. Besides which it is evident that intermediate products
may correspond with (and hence also break up into) different starting points; for instance,
N<sub>2</sub>O is obtained when <i>a</i> + <i>b</i> = 2, and this may occur either when <i>a</i> = 0 (nitric acid), and
<i>b</i> = 2 (hydroxylamine), or when <i>a</i> = <i>b</i> = 1 (the third of the above substitution products).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_354" id="Footnote_26_354"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_354"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Nitric acid corresponds with the anhydride N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, which will afterwards be described,
but which must be regarded as the highest saline oxide of nitrogen, just as Na<sub>2</sub>O (and the
hydroxide NaHO) in the case of sodium, although sodium forms a peroxide possessing the
property of parting with its oxygen with the same ease as hydrogen peroxide, if not on
heating, at all events in reactions&mdash;for instance, with acids. So also nitric acid has its
corresponding peroxide, which may be called pernitric acid. Its composition is not well
known&mdash;probably NHO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;so that its corresponding anhydride would be N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. It is
formed by the action of a silent discharge on a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen, so that
a portion of its oxygen is in a state similar to that in ozone. The instability of this substance
(obtained by Hautefeuille, Chappuis, and Berthelot), which easily splits up with
the formation of nitric peroxide, and its resemblance to persulphuric acid, which we shall
afterwards describe, will permit our passing over the consideration of the little that is
further known concerning it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_355" id="Footnote_27_355"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_355"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> Phosphorus (Chapter XIX.) gives the hydride PH<sub>3</sub>, corresponding with ammonia,
NH<sub>3</sub>, and forms phosphorous acid, PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which is analogous to nitrous acid, just as
phosphoric acid is to nitric acid; but phosphoric (or, better, orthophosphoric) acid,
PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, is able to lose water and give pyro-and meta-phosphoric acids. The latter is
equal to the ortho-acid minus water = PHO<sub>3</sub>, and therefore nitric acid, NHO<sub>3</sub>, is really
meta-nitric acid. So also nitrous acid, HNO<sub>2</sub>, is meta-nitrous (anhydrous) acid, and thus
the ortho-acid is NH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = N(OH)<sub>3</sub>. Hence for nitric acid we should expect to find, besides
the ordinary or meta-nitric acid, HNO<sub>3</sub> (= &frac12;N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O), and ortho-nitric acid,
H<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>4</sub> (= &frac12;N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O), an intermediate pyro-nitric acid, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, corresponding to
pyrophosphoric acid, P<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>. We shall see (for instance, in Chapter XVI., Note 21)
that in nitric acid there is indeed an inclination of the ordinary salts (of the meta-acid),
MNO<sub>3</sub>, to combine with bases M<sub>2</sub>O, and to approximate to the composition of ortho-compounds
which are equal to meta-compound and bases (MNO<sub>3</sub> + M<sub>2</sub>O = M<sub>3</sub>NO<sub>4</sub>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_356" id="Footnote_28_356"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_356"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> The formation of ammonia is observed in many cases of oxidation by means of
nitric acid. This substance is even formed in the action of nitric acid on tin, especially
if dilute acid be employed in the cold. A still more considerable amount of ammonia is
obtained if, in the action of nitric acid, there are conditions directly tending to the evolution
of hydrogen, which then reduces the acid to ammonia; for instance, in the action
of zinc on a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_BIS_357" id="Footnote_28_BIS_357"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_BIS_357"><span class="label">[28 bis]</span></a> Curtius started with benzoylhydrazine, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CONHNH<sub>2</sub> (hydrazine, see Note
<a href="#Footnote_20_BIS_346">20 bis</a>). (This substance is obtained by the action of hydrated hydrazine on the compound
ether of benzoic acid). Benzoylhydrazine under the action of nitrous acid gives
benzoylazoimide and water:</p>

<p class="title">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CONHNH<sub>2</sub> + NO<sub>2</sub>H = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CON<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Benzoylazoimide when treated with sodium alcoholate gives the sodium salt of hydronitrous acid:</p>

<p class="title">C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>CON<sub>3</sub> + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>ONa = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub> + NaN<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The addition of ether to the resultant solution precipitates the NaN<sub>3</sub>, and this salt when
treated with sulphuric acid gives gaseous hydronitrous acid, HN<sub>3</sub>. It has an acrid smell,
and is easily soluble in water. The aqueous solution exhibits a strongly acid reaction.
Metals dissolve in this solution and give the corresponding salts. With hydronitrous
acid gaseous ammonia forms a white cloud, consisting of the salt of ammonium, NH<sub>4</sub>N<sub>3</sub>.
This salt separates out from an alcoholic solution in the form of white lustrous scales.
The salts of hydronitrous acid are obtained by a reaction of substitution with the sodium
or ammonium salts. In this manner Curtius obtained and studied the salts of silver
(AgN<sub>3</sub>), mercury (HgN<sub>3</sub>), lead (PbN<sub>6</sub>), barium (BaN<sub>6</sub>). With hydrazine, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, hydronitrous
acid forms saline compounds in the composition of which there are one or two
particles of N<sub>3</sub>H per one particle of hydrazine; thus N<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub> and N<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. The first was
obtained in an almost pure form. It crystallises from an aqueous solution in dense,
volatile, lustrous prisms (up to 1 in. long), which fuse at 50°, and deliquesce in the air;
from a solution in boiling alcohol it separates out in bright crystalline plates. This salt,
N<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, has the same empirical composition, NH, as the ammonium salt of hydronitrous
acid, N<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and imide; but their molecules and structure are different. Curtius also
obtained (1893) hydronitrous acid by passing the vapour of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> (evolved by the action
of HNO<sub>3</sub> on As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) into a solution of hydrazine, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. Similarly Angeli, by acting upon a
saturated solution of silver nitrite with a strong solution of hydrazine, obtained the
explosive AgN<sub>3</sub> in the form of a precipitate, and this reaction, which is based upon the
equation N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + NHO<sub>2</sub> = HN<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O, proceeds so easily that it forms an experiment
for the lecture table. A thermal investigation of hydronitrous acid by Berthelot and
Matignon gave the following figures for the heat of solution of the ammonium salt
N<sub>3</sub>HNH<sub>3</sub> (1 grm. in 100 parts of water) -708 C., and for the heat of neutralisation
by barium hydrate +10·0 C., and by ammonia +8·2 C. The heat of combustion of
N<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (+163·8 C. at a constant vol.) gives the heat of formation of the salt N<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (solid) as
- 25·3 C. and (solution) - 32·3 C.; this explains the explosive nature of this compound.
In its heat of formation from the elements N<sub>3</sub>H = -62·6 C., this compound differs from
all the hydrogen compounds of nitrogen in having a maximum absorption of heat, which
explains its instability.</p></div>

starting points, and if the compounds formed be also gaseous, the following amounts
of heat, expressed in thousands of heat units, are <i>absorbed</i> (hence a minus sign):&mdash;</p>

<p>The difference is given in the lower line. For example, if N<sub>2</sub>, or 28 grams of nitrogen,
combine with O&mdash;that is, with 16 grams of oxygen&mdash;then 21,000 units of heat are absorbed,
that is, sufficient heat to raise 21,000 grams of water through 1°. Naturally, direct
observations are impossible in this case; but if charcoal, phosphorus, or similar substances
are burnt both in nitrous oxide and in oxygen, and the heat evolved is observed
in both cases, then the difference (more heat will be evolved in burning in nitrous oxide)
gives the figures required. If N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, by combining with O<sub>2</sub>, gives N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, then, as is
seen from the table, heat should be developed, namely, 38,000 units of heat, or NO + O
= 19,000 units of heat. The differences given in the table show that the maximum absorption
of heat corresponds with nitric oxide, and that the higher oxides are formed from it
with evolution of heat. If liquid nitric acid, NHO<sub>3</sub>, were decomposed into N + O<sub>3</sub> + H,
then 41,000 heat units would be required; that is, an evolution of heat takes place in its
formation from the gases. It should be observed that the formation of ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>,
from the gases N + H<sub>3</sub> evolves 12·2 thousand heat units.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_BIS_359" id="Footnote_29_BIS_359"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_BIS_359"><span class="label">[29 bis]</span></a> This often gives rise to the supposition that sulphuric acid possesses a considerable
degree of affinity or energy compared with nitric acid, but we shall afterwards see
that the idea of the relative degree of affinity of acids and bases is, in many cases,
exceedingly unbiassed; it need not be accepted so long as it is possible to explain the
observed phenomena without admitting any supposition whatever of the degree of the
force of affinity, because the latter cannot be measured. The action of sulphuric acid
upon nitre may be explained by the fact alone that the resultant nitric acid is volatile.
The nitric acid is the only one of all the substances partaking in the reaction which is
able to pass into vapour; it alone is volatile, while the remainder are non-volatile, or,
more strictly speaking, exceedingly difficultly volatile substances. Let us imagine that
the sulphuric acid is only able to set free a small quantity of nitric acid from its salt,
and this will suffice to explain the decomposition of the whole of the nitre by the sulphuric
acid, because once the nitric acid is separated it passes into vapour when heated, and
passes away from the sphere of action of the remaining substances; then the free
sulphuric acid will set free a fresh small quantity of nitric acid, and so on until it drives
off the entire quantity. It is evident that, in this explanation, it is essential that the
sulphuric acid should be in excess (although not greatly) throughout the reaction;
according to the equation expressing the reaction, 98 parts of sulphuric acid are required
per 85 parts of Chili nitre; but if this proportion be maintained in practice the nitric
acid is not all disengaged by the sulphuric acid; an excess of the latter must be taken,
and generally 80 parts of Chili nitre are taken per 98 parts of acid, so that a portion of
the sulphuric acid remains free to the very end of the reaction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_360" id="Footnote_30_360"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_360"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> It must be observed that sulphuric acid, at least when undiluted (60° Baumé),
corrodes cast iron with difficulty, so that the acid may be heated in cast-iron retorts.
Nevertheless, both sulphuric and nitric acids have a certain action on cast iron, and
therefore the acid obtained will contain traces of iron. In practice sodium nitrate (Chili
saltpetre) is usually employed because it is cheaper, but in the laboratory it is best to
take potassium nitrate, because it is purer and does not froth up so much as sodium
nitrate when heated with sulphuric acid. In the action of an excess of sulphuric acid on
nitre and nitric acid a portion of the latter is decomposed, forming lower oxides of
nitrogen, which are dissolved in the nitric acid. A portion of the sulphuric acid itself is
also carried over as spray by the vapours of the nitric acid. Hence sulphuric acid occurs
as an impurity in commercial nitric acid. A certain amount of hydrochloric acid will
also be found to be present in it, because sodium chloride is generally found as an impurity
in nitre, and under the action of sulphuric acid it forms hydrochloric acid. Commercial
acid further contains a considerable excess of water above that necessary for the
formation of the hydrate, because water is first poured into the earthenware vessels
employed for condensing the nitric acid in order to facilitate its cooling and condensation.
Further, the acid of composition HNO<sub>3</sub> decomposes with great ease, with the evolution
of oxides of nitrogen. Thus the commercial acid contains a great number of
impurities, and is frequently purified in the following manner:&mdash;Lead nitrate is first
added to the acid because it forms non-volatile and almost insoluble (precipitated)
substances with the free sulphuric and hydrochloric acids, and liberates nitric acid in so
doing, according to the equations Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl = PbCl<sub>2</sub> + 2NHO<sub>3</sub> and Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
+ H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = PbSO<sub>4</sub> + 2NHO<sub>3</sub>. Potassium chromate is then added to the impure nitric acid, by
which means oxygen is liberated from the chromic acid, and this oxygen, at the moment
of its evolution, oxidises the lower oxides of nitrogen and converts them into nitric acid.
A pure nitric acid, containing no impurities other than water, may be then obtained by
carefully distilling the acid, treated as above described, and particularly if only the
middle portions of the distillate are collected. Such acid should give no precipitate,
either with a solution of barium chloride (a precipitate shows the presence of sulphuric
acid) or with a solution of silver nitrate (a precipitate shows the presence of hydrochloric
acid), nor should it, after being diluted with water, give a coloration with starch containing
potassium iodide (a coloration shows the admixture of other oxides of nitrogen).
The oxides of nitrogen may be most easily removed from impure nitric acid by heating
for a certain time with a small quantity of pure charcoal. By the action of nitric
acid on the charcoal carbonic anhydride is evolved, which carries off the lower oxides of
nitrogen. On redistilling, pure acid is obtained. The oxides of nitrogen occurring in
solution may also be removed by passing air through the nitric acid.</p></div>

point (see Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_60_107">60</a>) for nitric acid was the compound 2HNO<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, but Roscoe
showed that its composition changes with a variation of the pressure and temperature
under which the distillation proceeds. Thus, at a pressure of 1 atmosphere the solution
of constant boiling point contains 68·6 p.c., and at one-tenth of an atmosphere 66·8 p.c.
Judging from what has been said concerning solutions of hydrochloric acid, and from the
variation of specific gravity, I think that the comparatively large decrease in the
tensions of the vapours depends on the formation of a hydrate, NHO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O (= 63·6 p.c.).
Such a hydrate may be expressed by N(HO)<sub>5</sub>, that is, as NH<sub>4</sub>(HO), in which all the
equivalents of hydrogen are replaced by hydroxyl. The constant boiling point will
then be the temperature of the decomposition of this hydrate.</p>

<p>The variation of the specific gravity at 15° from water (<i>p</i> = 0) to the hydrate
NHO<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O (41·2 p.c. HNO<sub>3</sub>) is expressed by <i>s</i> = 9992 + 57·4<i>p</i> + 0·16<i>p<sup>2</sup></i>, if water = 10,000 at
4°. For example, when <i>p</i> = 30 p.c., <i>s</i> = 11,860. For more concentrated solutions, at least,
the above-mentioned hydrate, HNO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, must be taken, up to which the specific gravity
<i>s</i> = 9570 + 84·18<i>p</i> - 0·240<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>; but perhaps (since the results of observations of the specific
gravity of the solutions are not in sufficient agreement to arrive at a conclusion) the
hydrate HNO<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O should be recognised, as is indicated by many nitrates (Al, Mg, Co,
&amp;c.), which crystallise with this amount of water of crystallisation. From HNO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O
to HNO<sub>3</sub> the specific gravity of the solutions (at 15°) <i>s</i> = 10,652 + 62·08<i>p</i> - 0·160<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>. The
hydrate HNO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O is recognised by Berthelot on the basis of the thermochemical
data for solutions of nitric acid, because on approaching to this composition there is a
rapid change in the amount of heat evolved by mixing nitric acid with water. Pickering
(1892) by refrigeration obtained the crystalline hydrates: HNO<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, melting at -37°
and HNO<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O, melting at -18°. A more detailed study of the reactions of hydrated
nitric acid would no doubt show the existence of change in the process and rapidity of
reaction in approaching these hydrates.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_362" id="Footnote_32_362"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_362"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> The normal hydrate HNO<sub>3</sub>, corresponding with the ordinary salts, may be termed
the monohydrated acid, because the anhydride N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> with water forms this normal nitric
acid. In this sense the hydrate HNO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O is the pentahydrated acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_363" id="Footnote_33_363"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_363"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> For technical and laboratory purposes recourse is frequently had to <i>red fuming
nitric acid</i>&mdash;that is, the normal nitric acid, HNO<sub>3</sub>, containing lower oxides of nitrogen
in solution. This acid is prepared by decomposing nitre with half its weight of strong
sulphuric acid, or by distilling nitric acid with an excess of sulphuric acid. The normal
nitric acid is first obtained, but it partially decomposes, and gives the lower oxidation
products of nitrogen, which are dissolved by the nitric acid, to which they impart its
usual pale-brown or reddish colour. This acid fumes in the air, from which it attracts
moisture, forming a less volatile hydrate. If carbonic anhydride be passed through the
red-brown fuming nitric acid for a long period of time, especially if, assisted by a
moderate heat, it expels all the lower oxides, and leaves a colourless acid free from these
oxides. It is necessary, in the preparation of the red acid, that the receivers should be
kept quite cool, because it is only when cold that nitric acid is able to dissolve a large
proportion of the oxides of nitrogen. The strong red fuming acid has a specific gravity
1·56 at 20°, and has a suffocating smell of the oxides of nitrogen. When the red acid is
mixed with water it turns green, and then of a bluish colour, and with an excess of water
ultimately becomes colourless. This is owing to the fact that the oxides of nitrogen in
the presence of water and nitric acid are changed, and give coloured solutions.</p>

<p>Markleffsky (1892) showed that the green solutions contain (besides HNO<sub>3</sub>) HNO<sub>2</sub>
and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, whilst the blue solutions only contain HNO<sub>2</sub> (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_48_380">48</a>).</p>

<p>The action of red fuming nitric acid (or a mixture with sulphuric acid) is in many
cases very powerful and rapid, and it sometimes acts differently from pure nitric
acid. Thus iron becomes covered with a coating of oxides, and insoluble in acids; it
becomes, as is said, passive. Thus chromic acid (and potassium dichromate) gives oxide
of chromium in this red acid&mdash;that is, it is deoxidised. This is owing to the presence of
the lower oxides of nitrogen, which are capable of being oxidised&mdash;that is, of passing into
nitric acid like the higher oxides. But, generally, the action of fuming nitric acid, both
red and colourless, is powerfully oxidising.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_364" id="Footnote_34_364"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_364"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Hydrogen is not evolved in the action of nitric acid (especially strong) on metals,
even with those metals which evolve hydrogen under the action of other acids. This is
because the hydrogen at the moment of its separation reduces the nitric acid, with formation
of the lower oxides of nitrogen, as we shall afterwards see.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_365" id="Footnote_35_365"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_365"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Certain basic salts of nitric acid, however (for example, the basic salt of bismuth),
are insoluble in water; whilst, on the other hand, all the normal salts are soluble, and
this forms an exceptional phenomenon among acids, because all the ordinary acids form
insoluble salts with one or another base. Thus, for sulphuric acid the salts of barium,
lead, &amp;c., for hydrochloric acid the salts of silver, &amp;c., are insoluble in water. However,
the normal salts of acetic and certain other acids are all soluble.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_366" id="Footnote_36_366"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_366"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> <i>Ammonium nitrate</i>, NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>, is easily obtained by adding a solution of ammonia
or of ammonium carbonate to nitric acid until it becomes neutral. On evaporating
this solution, crystals of the salt are formed which contain no water of crystallisation.
It crystallises in prisms like those formed by common nitre, and has a refreshing taste;
100 parts of water at <i>t</i>° dissolve 54 + 0·61<i>t</i> parts by weight of the salt. It is soluble in
alcohol, melts at 160°, and is decomposed at about 180°, forming water and nitrous oxide,
NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>O. If ammonium nitrate be mixed with sulphuric acid, and the
mixture be heated to about the boiling point of water, then nitric acid is evolved, and
ammonium hydrogen sulphate remains in solution; but if the mixture be heated rapidly
to 16O°, then nitrous oxide is evolved. In the first case the sulphuric acid takes up
ammonia, and in the second place water. Ammonium nitrate is employed in practice for
the artificial production of cold, because in dissolving in water it lowers the temperature
very considerably. For this purpose it is best to take equal parts by weight of the salt
and water. The salt must first be reduced to a powder and then rapidly stirred up in
the water, when the temperature will fall from +15° to -10°, so that the water freezes.</p>

<p>Ammonium nitrate absorbs ammonia, with which it forms unstable compounds
resembling compounds containing water of crystallisation. (Divers 1872, Raoult 1873.)
At -10° NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>,2NH<sub>3</sub> is formed: it is a liquid of sp. gr. 1·15, which loses all its
ammonia under the influence of heat. At +28° NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>,NH<sub>3</sub> is formed: it is a solid
which easily parts with its ammonia when heated, especially in solution.</p>

<p>Troost (1882) investigated the tension of the dissociation of the compounds formed,
and came to the conclusion that a definite compound corresponding to the formula
2NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>,3NH<sub>3</sub> is formed, because the tension of dissociation remains constant in the
decomposition of such a compound at 0°. Y. Kouriloff (1893), however, considers that
the constancy of the tension of the ammonia evolved is due to the decomposition of a
saturated solution, and not of a definite compound. During decomposition the system is
composed of a liquid and a solid; the tension only becomes constant from the moment
the solid falls down. The composition 2NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>,3NH<sub>3</sub> corresponds to a saturated
solution at 0°, and the solubility of NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> in NH<sub>3</sub> increases with a rise of temperature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_BIS_367" id="Footnote_36_BIS_367"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_BIS_367"><span class="label">[36 bis]</span></a> This is explained by saying that in true nitro-compounds the residue of nitric
acid NO<sub>2</sub> takes the place of the hydrogen in the hydrocarbon group. For example, if
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH be given, then C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(NO<sub>2</sub>)OH will be a true nitro-compound having the radical
properties of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH. If, on the other hand, the NO<sub>2</sub> replace the hydrogen of the
aqueous radicle (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>ONO<sub>2</sub>), then the chemical character varies, as in the passage of
KOH into KONO<sub>2</sub> (nitre) (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_37_368">37</a> and Organic Chemistry).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_368" id="Footnote_37_368"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_368"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> The compound ethers of nitric acid in which the hydrogen of the aqueous radicle
(OH) is replaced by the residue of nitric acid (NO<sub>2</sub>) are frequently called nitro-compounds.
But in their chemical character they differ from true nitro-compounds
(for details <i>see</i> Organic Chemistry) and do not burn like them.</p>

<p>The action of nitric acid on cellulose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, is an example. This substance, which
forms the outer coating of all plant cells, occurs in an almost pure state in cotton, in
common writing-paper, and in flax, &amp;c.; under the action of nitric acid it forms water
and nitrocellulose (like water and KNO<sub>3</sub> from KHO), which, although it has the same
appearance as the cotton originally taken, differs from it entirely in properties. It
explodes when struck, bursts into flame very easily under the action of sparks, and acts
like gunpowder, whence its name of pyroxylin, or gun-cotton. The composition of
gun-cotton is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>7</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>11</sub> = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 3NHO<sub>3</sub> - 3H<sub>2</sub>O. The proportion of the group NO<sub>2</sub>
in nitrocellulose may be decreased by limiting the action of the nitric acid and
compounds obtained with different properties; for instance, the (impure) well-known
<i>collodion cotton</i>, containing from 11 to 12 per cent. of nitrogen, and <i>pyro-collodion</i>
(Mendeléeff, 1890), containing 12·4 per cent. of nitrogen. Both these products are soluble in
a mixture of alcohol and ether (in collodion a portion of the substance is soluble in alcohol),
and the solution when evaporated gives a transparent film, which is insoluble in water. A
solution of collodion is employed in medicine for covering wounds, and in wet-plate
photography for giving on glass an even coating of a substance into which the various
reagents employed in the process are introduced. Extremely fine threads (obtained by
forcing a gelatinous mixture of collodion, ether, and alcohol through capillary tubes in
water) of collodion form artificial silk.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_BIS_369" id="Footnote_37_BIS_369"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_BIS_369"><span class="label">[37 bis]</span></a> The property possessed by nitroglycerin (occurring in dynamite), nitrocellulose,
and the other nitro-compounds, of burning with an explosion, and their employment for
smokeless powder and as explosives in general, depends on the reasons in virtue of
which a mixture of nitre and charcoal deflagrates and explodes; in both cases the
elements of the nitric acid occurring in the compound are decomposed, the oxygen in
burning unites with the carbon, and the nitrogen is set free; thus a very large volume
of gaseous substances (nitrogen and oxides of carbon) is rapidly formed from the solid
substances originally taken. These gases occupy an incomparably larger volume than
the original substance, and therefore produce a powerful pressure and explosion. It is
evident that in exploding with the development of heat (that is, in decomposing, not
with the absorption of energy, as is generally the case, but with the evolution of energy)
the nitro-compounds form stores of energy which are easily set free, and that consequently
their elements occur in a state of particularly energetic motion, which is
especially strong in the group NO<sub>2</sub>: this group is common to all nitro-compounds, and
all the oxygen compounds of nitrogen are unstable, easily decomposable, and (Note <a href="#Footnote_29_358">29</a>)
absorb heat in their formation. On the other hand, the nitro-compounds are instructive
as an example and proof of the fact that the elements and groups forming compounds
are united in definite order in the molecules of a compound. A blow, concussion, or
rise of temperature is necessary to bring the combustible elements C and H into the
most intimate contact with NO<sub>2</sub>, and to distribute the elements in a new order in new
compounds.</p>

<p>As regards the composition of the nitro-compounds, it will be seen that the hydrogen
of a given substance is replaced by the complex group NO<sub>2</sub> of the nitric acid. The same
is observed in the passage of alkalis into nitrates, so that the reactions of substitution of
nitric acid&mdash;that is, the formation of salts and nitro-compounds&mdash;may be expressed in
the following manner. In these cases the hydrogen is replaced by the so-called <i>radicle
of nitric acid</i> NO<sub>2</sub>, as is evident from the following table:&mdash; </p>

<p>The difference between the salts formed by nitric acid and the nitro-compounds
consists in the fact that nitric acid is very easily separated from the salts of nitric acid
by means of sulphuric acid (that is, by a method of double saline decomposition), whilst
nitric acid is not displaced by sulphuric acid from true nitro-compounds; for instance,
nitrobenzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·NO<sub>2</sub>. As nitro-compounds are formed exclusively from hydrocarbons,
they are described with them in organic chemistry.</p>

<p>The group NO<sub>2</sub> of nitro-compounds in many cases (like all the oxidised compounds of
nitrogen) passes into the ammonia group or into the ammonia radicle NH<sub>2</sub>. This requires
the action of reducing substances evolving hydrogen: RNO<sub>2</sub> + 6H = RNH<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. Thus
Zinin converted nitrobenzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·NO<sub>2</sub>, into aniline, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·NH<sub>2</sub>, by the action of
hydrogen sulphide.</p>

<p>Admitting the existence of the group NO<sub>2</sub>, as replacing hydrogen in various
compounds, then nitric acid may be considered as water in which half the hydrogen
is replaced by the radical of nitric acid. In this sense nitric acid is nitro-water,
NO<sub>2</sub>OH, and its anhydride dinitro-water, (NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O. In nitric acid the radical of
nitric acid is combined with hydroxyl, just as in nitrobenzene it is combined with the
radical of benzene.</p>

<p>It should here be remarked that the group NO<sub>3</sub> may be recognised in the salts of
nitric acid, because the salts have the composition M(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>n</sub>, just as the metallic chlorides
have the composition MCl<sub>n</sub>. But the group NO<sub>3</sub> does not form any other compounds
beyond the salts, and therefore it should he considered as hydroxyl, HO, in which H is
replaced by NO<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_370" id="Footnote_38_370"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_370"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> The nitro-compounds play a very important part in mining and artillery. Detailed
accounts of them must be looked for in special works, among which the works of
A. R. Shuliachenke and T. M. Chelletsoff occupy an important place in the Russian
literature on this subject, although historically the scientific works of Abel in England
and Berthelot in France stand pre-eminent. The latter elucidated much in connection
with explosive compounds by a series of both experimental and theoretical researches.
Among explosives a particularly important place from a practical point of view is
occupied by ordinary or black gunpowder (Chapter XIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_16_795">16</a>), fulminating
mercury (Chapter XVI., Note 26), the different forms of gun-cotton (Chapter VI., Note <a href="#Footnote_37_368">37</a>),
and nitro-glycerine (Chapter VIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_45_491">45</a>, and Chapter XII., Note <a href="#Footnote_33_753">33</a>). The latter
when mixed with solid pulverulent substances, like magnesia, tripoli, &amp;c., forms
dynamite, which is so largely used in quarries and mines in driving tunnels, &amp;c. We
may add that the simplest true nitro-compound, or marsh gas, CH<sub>4</sub>, in which all the
hydrogens are replaced by NO<sub>2</sub> groups has been obtained by L. N. Shishkoff, C(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>,
as well as nitroform, CH(NO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.</p></div>

<p>Nitric acid may be entirely decomposed by passing its vapour over highly incandescent
copper, because the oxides of nitrogen first formed give up their oxygen to the
red-hot metallic copper, so that water and nitrogen gas alone are obtained. This
forms a means for determining the composition both of nitric acid and of all the
other compounds of nitrogen with
oxygen, because by collecting the
gaseous nitrogen formed it is
possible to calculate, from its
volume, its weight and consequently
its amount in a given
quantity of a nitrogenous substance,
and by weighing the copper
before and after the decomposition
it is possible to determine
the amount of oxygen by the
increase in weight. The complete
decomposition of nitric acid is
also accomplished by passing a
mixture of hydrogen and nitric
acid vapours through a red-hot
tube. Sodium also decomposes the oxides of nitrogen at a red-heat, taking up all the
oxygen. This method is sometimes used for determining the composition of the oxides
of nitrogen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_372" id="Footnote_40_372"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_372"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> The application of this acid for etching copper or steel in engraving is based on
this fact. The copper is covered with a coating of wax, resin, &amp;c. (etching ground), on
which nitric acid does not act, and then the ground is removed in certain parts with a
needle, and the whole is washed in nitric acid. The parts coated remain untouched,
whilst the uncovered portions are eaten into by the acid. Copper plates for etchings,
aquatints, &amp;c., are prepared in this manner.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_373" id="Footnote_41_373"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_373"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> The formation of such complex equations as the above often presents some difficulty
to the beginner. It should be observed that if the reacting and resultant substances
be known, it is easy to form an equation for the reaction. Thus, if we wish to
form an equation expressing the reaction that nitric acid acting on zinc gives nitrous
oxide, N<sub>2</sub>O, and zinc nitrate, Zn(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, we must reason as follows:&mdash;Nitric acid contains
hydrogen, whilst the salt and nitrous oxide do not; hence water is formed, and therefore
it is as though anhydrous nitric acid, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, were acting. For its conversion into nitrous
oxide it parts with four equivalents of oxygen, and hence it is able to oxidise four equivalents
of zinc and to convert it into zinc oxide, ZnO. These four equivalents of zinc
oxide require for their conversion into the salt four more equivalents of nitric anhydride;
consequently five equivalents in all of the latter are required, or ten equivalents of nitric
acid. Thus ten equivalents of nitric acid are necessary for four equivalents of
zinc in order to express the reaction in whole equivalents. It must not be forgotten,
however, that there are very few such reactions which can be entirely expressed by simple
equations. The majority of equations of reactions only express the chief and ultimate
products of reaction, and thus none of the three preceding equations express all that
in reality occurs in the action of metals on nitric acid. In no one of them is only one
oxide of nitrogen formed, but always several together or consecutively&mdash;one after the
other, according to the temperature and strength of the acid. And this is easily intelligible.
The resulting oxide is itself capable of acting on metals and of being
deoxidised, and in the presence of the nitric acid it may change the acid and be itself
changed. The equations given must be looked on as a systematic expression of the
main features of reactions, or as a limit towards which they tend, but to which they
only attain in the absence of disturbing influences.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_374" id="Footnote_42_374"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_374"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Montemartini endeavours to show that the products evolved in the action of nitric
acid upon metals (and their amount) is in direct connection with both the concentration
of the acid and the capacity of the metals to decompose water. Those metals which
only decompose water at a high temperature give, under the action of nitric acid, NO<sub>2</sub>,
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and NO; whilst those metals which decompose water at a lower temperature give,
besides the above products, N<sub>2</sub>O, N, and NH<sub>3</sub>; and, lastly, the metals which decompose
water at the ordinary temperature also evolve hydrogen. It is observed that concentrated
nitric acid oxidises many metals with much greater difficulty than when diluted with
water; iron, copper, and tin are very easily oxidised by dilute nitric acid, but remain
unaltered under the influence of monohydrated nitric acid or of the pure hydrate NHO<sub>3</sub>.
Nitric acid diluted with a large quantity of water does not oxidise copper, but it oxidises
tin; dilute nitric acid also does not oxidise either silver or mercury; but, on the addition
of nitrous acid, even dilute acid acts on the above metals. This naturally depends on
the smaller stability of nitrous acid, and on the fact that after the commencement of
the action the nitric acid is itself converted into nitrous acid, which continues to act on the
silver and mercury. Veley (Oxford 1891) made detailed researches on the action of
nitric acid upon Cu, Hg, and Bi, and showed that nitric acid of 30 p.c. strength does
not act upon these metals at the ordinary temperature if nitrous acid (traces are destroyed
by urea) and oxidising agents such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, KClO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. be entirely absent; but in the
presence of even a small amount of nitrous acid the metals form nitrites, which, with
HNO<sub>3</sub>, form nitrates and the oxides of nitrogen, which re-form the nitrous acid
necessary for starting the reaction, because the reaction 2NO + HNO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 3HNO<sub>2</sub> is
reversible. The above metals are quickly dissolved in a 1 p.c. solution of nitrous acid.
Moreover, Veley observed that nitric acid is partially converted into nitrous acid by
gaseous hydrogen in the presence of the nitrates of Cu and Pb.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_375" id="Footnote_43_375"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_375"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> When nitric acid acts on many organic substances it often happens that not only
is hydrogen removed, but also oxygen is combined; thus, for example, nitric acid converts
toluene, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, into benzoic acid, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In certain cases, also, a portion of the
carbon contained in an organic substance burns at the expense of the oxygen of the
nitric acid. So, for instance, phthalic acid, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, is obtained from naphthalene, <sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>.
Thus the action of nitric acid on the hydrocarbons is often most complex; not only does
nitrification take place, but also separation of carbon, displacement of hydrogen, and
combination of oxygen. There are few organic substances which can withstand the
action of nitric acid, and it causes fundamental changes in a number of them.
It leaves a yellow stain on the skin, and in a large quantity causes a wound and entirely
eats away the membranes of the body. The membranes of plants are eaten into with the
greatest ease by strong nitric acid in just the same manner. One of the most durable
blue vegetable dyes employed in dyeing tissues is <i>indigo</i>; yet it is easily <i>converted into
a yellow substance</i> by the action of nitric acid, and small traces of free nitric acid may
be recognised by this means.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_378" id="Footnote_46_378"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_378"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> The phenomena and laws of dissociation, which we shall consider only in particular
instances, are discussed in detail in works on theoretical chemistry. Nevertheless, in
respect to nitrogen peroxide, as an historically important example of dissociation in a
homogeneous gaseous medium, we will cite the results of the careful investigations (1885&ndash;1880)
of E. and L. Natanson, who determined the densities under various conditions of
temperature and pressure. The degree of dissociation, expressed as above (it may also he
expressed otherwise&mdash;for example, by the ratio of the quantity of substance decomposed to
that unaltered), proves to increase at all temperatures as the pressure diminishes, which
would he expected for a homogeneous gaseous medium, as a decreasing pressure aids
the formation of the lightest product of dissociation (that having the least density or
largest volume). Thus, in the Natansons' experiments the degree of dissociation at 0° increases
from 10 p.c. to 30 p.c., with a decrease of pressure of from 251 to 38 mm.; at 49°·7
it increases from 49 p.c. to 93 p.c., with a fall of pressure of from 498 to 27 mm., and at
100° it increases from 89·2 p.c. to 99·7 p.c., with a fall of pressure of from 732·5 to 11·7 mm.
At 130° and 150° the decomposition is complete&mdash;that is, only NO<sub>2</sub> remains at the low
pressures (less than the atmospheric) at which the Natansons made their determinations;
but it is probable that at higher pressures (of several atmospheres) molecules of
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> would still be formed, and it would be exceedingly interesting to trace the phenomena
under the conditions of both very considerable pressures and of relatively large
volumes.</p></div>

at 0° = 1·494 and at 15° = 1·474. It is evident that, in the liquid as in the gaseous state,
the variation of density with the temperature depends, not only on physical, but also on
chemical changes, as the amount of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> decreases and the amount of NO<sub>2</sub> increases with
the temperature, and they (as polymeric substances) should have different densities, as
we find, for instance, in the hydrocarbons C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub> and C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>20</sub>.</p>

<p>It may not be superfluous to mention here that the measurement of the specific heat
of a mixture of the vapours of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> enabled Berthelot to determine that the
transformation of 2NO<sub>2</sub> into N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is accompanied by the evolution of about 13,000 units
of heat, and as the reaction proceeds with equal facility in either direction, it will be
exothermal in the one direction and endothermal in the other; and this clearly demonstrates
the possibility of reactions taking place in either direction, although, as a rule,
reactions evolving heat proceed with greater ease.</p></div>

as dark brown powders, which do not, however, exhibit the reactions of salts. Thus
by passing gaseous nitrogen dioxide over freshly reduced (from the oxides by heating

decomposition (for instance, of the barium salt with ammonium sulphate) to the other
salts of nitrous acid, but it decomposes with great ease when evaporated, with evolution
of gaseous nitrogen, as already mentioned (Chapter <a href="#Page_223">V</a>.) If the solution, however,
be evaporated at the ordinary temperature under the receiver of an air-pump, a solid
saline mass is obtained, which is easily decomposed when heated. The dry salt even
decomposes with an explosion when struck, or when heated to about 70°&mdash;NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub>
= 2H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>. It is also formed by the action of aqueous ammonia on a mixture of nitric
oxide and oxygen, or by the action of ozone on ammonia, and in many other instances.
Zörensen (1894) prepared NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>2</sub> by the action of a mixture of N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and other oxides
of nitrogen on lumps of ammonium carbonate, extracting the nitrite of ammonium
formed with absolute alcohol, and precipitating it from this solution by ether. This salt
is crystalline, dissolves in water with absorption of heat, and attracts moisture from the
air. The solid salt and its concentrated solutions decompose with an explosion when
heated to 50°&ndash;80°, especially in the presence of traces of foreign acids. Decomposition
also proceeds at the ordinary temperature, but more slowly; and in order to preserve the
salt it should be covered with a layer of pure dry ether.</p></div>

silver oxide, which is also present in the precipitate, owing to the fact that potassium
nitrite always contains a certain amount of oxide, which with water gives the hydroxide,
forming oxide of silver with silver nitrate. The solution of silver nitrite gives, by double

<p>If nitrogen peroxide be cooled to -20°, and half its weight of water be added to it drop
by drop, then the peroxide is decomposed, as we have already said, into nitrous and nitric
acids; the former does not then remain as a hydrate, but straightway passes into the
anhydride, and, hence, if the resultant liquid be slightly warmed vapours of nitrous
anhydride, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, are evolved, and condense into a blue liquid, as Fritzsche showed.
This method of preparing nitrous anhydride apparently gives the purest product, but it
easily dissociates, forming NO and NO<sub>2</sub> (and therefore also nitric acid in the presence
of water).</p></div>

and common oxygen O<sub>2</sub>. In a physical aspect the relation between N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and O<sub>3</sub> is

This reaction is employed for transforming many nitrogenous organic substances having

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_392" id="Footnote_59_392"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_392"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> Kammerer proposed preparing nitric oxide, NO, by pouring a solution of sodium
nitrate over copper shavings, and adding sulphuric acid drop by drop. The oxidation of
ferrous salts by nitric acid also gives NO. One part of strong hydrochloric acid is taken
and iron is dissolved in it (FeCl<sub>2</sub>), and then an equal quantity of hydrochloric acid and
nitre is added to the solution. On heating, nitric oxide is evolved. In the presence of
an excess of sulphuric acid and mercury the conversion of nitric acid into nitric oxide is
complete (that is, the reaction proceeds to the end and the nitric oxide is obtained without
other products), and upon this is founded one of the methods for determining nitric acid
(in nitrometers of various kinds, described in text-books of analytical chemistry), as the
amount of NO can be easily and accurately measured volumetrically. The amount of
nitrogen in gun-cotton, for instance, is determined by dissolving it in sulphuric acid.
Nitrous acid acts in the same manner. Upon this property Emich (1892) founds his
method for preparing pure NO. He pours mercury into a flask, and then covers it with
sulphuric acid, in which a certain amount of NaNO<sub>2</sub> or other substance corresponding
to HNO<sub>2</sub> or HNO<sub>3</sub> has been dissolved. The evolution of NO proceeds at the ordinary
temperature, being more rapid as the surface of the mercury is increased (if shaken, the
reaction proceeds very rapidly). If the gas be passed over KHO, it is obtained quite
pure, because KHO does not act upon NO at the ordinary temperature (if heated, KNO<sub>2</sub>
and N<sub>2</sub>O or N<sub>2</sub>, are formed).</p></div>

nitric acid in the presence of water, and with the evolution of heat, presents a most
striking instance of liquefaction produced by the action of chemical forces. They perform
with ease the work which physical (cooling) and mechanical (pressure) forces effect
with difficulty. In this the motion, which is so distinctively the property of the gaseous
molecules, is apparently destroyed. In other cases of chemical action it is apparently
created, arising, no doubt, from latent energy&mdash;that is, from the internal motion of the
atoms in the molecules.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61_394" id="Footnote_61_394"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_394"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> Nitric oxide is capable of entering into many characteristic combinations; it is
absorbed by the solutions of many acids, for instance, tartaric, acetic, phosphoric,
sulphuric, and metallic chlorides (for example, SbCl<sub>5</sub>, BiCl<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., with which it forms
definite compounds; Besson 1889), and also by the solutions of many salts, especially
those formed by suboxide of iron (for instance, ferrous sulphate). In this case a brown
compound is formed which is exceedingly unstable, like all the analogous compounds of
nitric oxide. The amount of nitric oxide combined in this manner is in atomic proportion
with the amount of the substance taken; thus ferrous sulphate, FeSO<sub>4</sub>, absorbs
it in the proportion of NO to 2FeSO<sub>4</sub>. Ammonia is obtained by the action of a caustic
alkali on the resultant compound, because the oxygen of the nitric oxide and water are
transferred to the ferrous oxide, forming ferric oxide, whilst the nitrogen combines with
the hydrogen of the water. According to the investigations of Gay (1885), the compound
is formed with the evolution of a large quantity of heat, and is easily dissociated, like a
solution of ammonia in water. It is evident that oxidising substances (for example,
potassium permanganate, KMnO<sub>4</sub>, Note <a href="#Footnote_57_390">57</a>) are able to convert it into nitric acid. If
the presence of a radicle NO<sub>2</sub>, composed like nitrogen peroxide, must be recognised in
the compounds of nitric acid, then a radicle NO, having the composition of nitric oxide,
may be admitted in the compounds of nitrous acid. The compounds in which the radicle
NO is recognised are called <i>nitroso-compounds</i>. These substances are described in
Prof. Bunge's work (Kief, 1868).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62_395" id="Footnote_62_395"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_395"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> A mixture of nitric oxide and hydrogen is inflammable. If a mixture of the two
gases be passed over spongy platinum the nitrogen and hydrogen even combine, forming
ammonia. A mixture of nitric oxide with many combustible vapours and gases is very inflammable.
A very characteristic flame is obtained in burning a mixture of nitric oxide
and the vapour of the combustible carbon bisulphide, CS<sub>2</sub>. The latter substance is very
volatile, so that it is sufficient to pass the nitric oxide through a layer of the carbon bisulphide
(for instance, in a Woulfe's bottle) in order that the gas escaping should contain a
considerable amount of the vapours of this substance. This mixture continues to burn
when ignited, and the flame emits a large quantity of the so-called ultra-violet rays,
which are capable of inducing chemical combinations and decompositions, and therefore
the flame may be employed in photography in the absence of sufficient daylight (magnesium
light and electric light have the same property). There are many gases (for instance,
ammonia) which when mixed with nitric oxide explode in a eudiometer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_63_396" id="Footnote_63_396"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_396"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> The oxides of nitrogen naturally do not proceed directly from oxygen and nitrogen
by contact alone, because their formation is accompanied by the absorption of a large
quantity of heat, for (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_29_358">29</a>) about 21,500 heat units are absorbed when 16
parts of oxygen and 14 parts of nitrogen combine; consequently the decomposition of
nitric oxide into oxygen and nitrogen is accompanied by the evolution of this amount of
heat; and therefore with nitric oxide, as with all explosive substances and mixtures, the
reaction once started is able to proceed by itself. In fact, Berthelot remarked the decomposition
of nitric oxide in the explosion of fulminate of mercury. This decomposition
does not take place spontaneously; substances even burn with difficulty in nitric oxide,
probably because a certain portion of the nitric oxide in decomposing gives oxygen, which
combines with another portion of nitric oxide, and forms nitric peroxide, a somewhat more
stable compound of nitrogen and oxygen. The further combinations of nitric oxide with
oxygen all proceed with the evolution of heat, and take place spontaneously by contact
with air alone. It is evident from these examples that the application of thermochemical
data is limited.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_64_397" id="Footnote_64_397"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_397"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> The instance of the action of a small quantity of NO in inducing a definite
chemical reaction between large masses (SO<sub>2</sub> + O + H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) is very instructive,
because the particulars relating to it have been studied, and show that intermediate
forms of reaction may be discovered in the so-called contact or catalytic phenomena.
The essence of the matter here is that A (= SO<sub>2</sub>) reacts upon B (= O and H<sub>2</sub>O) in the presence
of C, because it gives BC, a substance which forms AB with A, and again liberates
C. Consequently C is a medium, a transferring substance, without which the reaction
does not proceed. Many similar phenomena may be found in other departments of life.
Thus the merchant is an indispensable medium between the producer and the consumer;
experiment is a medium between the phenomena of nature and the cognisant faculties,
and language, customs, and laws are media which are as necessary for the exchanges
of social intercourse as nitric oxide for those between sulphurous anhydride and oxygen
and water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65_398" id="Footnote_65_398"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_398"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> If the sulphurous anhydride be prepared by roasting iron pyrites, FeS<sub>2</sub>, then
each equivalent of pyrites (equivalent of iron, 56, of sulphur 32, of pyrites 120) requires
six equivalents of oxygen (that is 96 parts) for the conversion of its sulphur into sulphuric
acid (for forming 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> with water), besides 1&frac12; equivalents (24 parts) for converting
the iron into oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; hence the combustion of the pyrites for the formation
of sulphuric acid and ferric oxide requires the introduction of an equal weight of oxygen
(120 parts of oxygen to 120 parts of pyrites), or five times its weight of air, whilst four
parts by weight of nitrogen will remain inactive, and in the removal of the exhausted
air will carry off the remaining nitric oxide. If not all, at least a large portion of the
nitric oxide may be collected by passing the escaping air, still containing some oxygen,
through substances which absorb oxides of nitrogen. Sulphuric acid itself may be employed
for this purpose if it be used in the form of the hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, or containing only a
small amount of water, because such sulphuric acid dissolves the oxides of nitrogen.
They may be easily expelled from this solution by heating or by dilution with water, as
they are only slightly soluble in aqueous sulphuric acid. Besides which, sulphurous
anhydride acts on such sulphuric acid, being oxidised at the expense of the nitrous anhydride,
and forming nitric oxide from it, which again enters into the cycle of action. For
this reason the sulphuric acid which has absorbed the oxides of nitrogen escaping from
the chambers in the tower <span class="smcap">K</span> (<i>see</i> fig. <a href="#fig_50">50</a>) is led back into the first chamber, where it
comes into contact with sulphurous anhydride, by which means the oxides of nitrogen
are reintroduced into the reaction which proceeds in the chambers. This is the use of
the towers (Gay-Lussac's and Glover's) which are erected at either end of the chambers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65_BIS_399" id="Footnote_65_BIS_399"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_BIS_399"><span class="label">[65 bis]</span></a> Other metals, iron, copper, zinc, are corroded by it; glass and china are not
acted upon, but they crack from the variations of temperature taking place in the chambers,
and besides they are more difficult to join properly than lead; wood, &amp;c., becomes
charred.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_66_400" id="Footnote_66_400"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_400"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> By this means as much as 2,500,000 kilograms of chamber acid, containing about
60 per cent. of the hydrate H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and about 40 per cent. of water, may be manufactured
per year in one plant of 5,000 cubic metres capacity (without stoppages). This process
has been brought to such a degree of perfection that as much as 300 parts of the hydrate
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are obtained from 100 parts of sulphur, whilst the theoretical amount is not
greater than 306 parts. The acid parts with its excess of water on heating. For this
purpose it is heated in lead vessels. However, the acid containing about 75 per cent. of
the hydrate (60° Baumé) already begins to act on the lead when heated, and therefore
the further removal of water is conducted by evaporating in glass or platinum vessels,
as will he described in Chapter XX. The aqueous acid (50° Baumé) obtained in the
chambers is termed chamber acid. The acid concentrated to 60° Baumé is more
generally employed, and sometimes the hydrate (66° Baumé) termed vitriol acid is also
used. In England alone more than 1,000 million kilograms of chamber acid are produced
by this method. The formation of sulphuric acid by the action of nitric acid was discovered
by Drebbel, and the first lead chamber was erected by Roebuck, in Scotland, in
the middle of the last century. The essence of the process was only brought to light at
the beginning of this century, when many improvements were introduced into practice.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_67_401" id="Footnote_67_401"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_401"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> If the hydrate HNO<sub>3</sub> corresponds to N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the hydrate HNO, <i>hyponitrous acid</i>,
corresponds to N<sub>2</sub>O, and in this sense N<sub>2</sub>O is <i>hyponitrous anhydride</i>. Hyponitrous
acid, corresponding with nitrous oxide (as its anhydride), is not known in a pure state,
but its salts (Divers) are known. They are prepared by the reduction of nitrous (and
consequently of nitric) salts by sodium amalgam. If this amalgam he added to a cold
solution of an alkaline nitrite until the evolution of gas ceases, and the excess of alkali
saturated with acetic acid, an insoluble yellow precipitate of silver hyponitrite, NAgO,
will he obtained on adding a solution of silver nitrate. This hyponitrite is insoluble in
cold acetic acid, and decomposes when heated, with the evolution of nitrous oxide. If
rapidly heated it decomposes with an explosion. It is dissolved unchanged by weak
mineral acids, whilst the stronger acids (for example, sulphuric and hydrochloric acids)
decompose it, with the evolution of nitrogen, nitric and nitrous acids remaining in solution.
Among the other salts of hyponitrous acid, HNO, the salts of lead, copper, and mercury
are insoluble in water. Judging by the bond between hyponitrous acid and the other
compounds of nitrogen, there is reason for thinking that its formula should he doubled,
N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. For instance, Thoune (1893) on gradually oxidising hydroxylamine, NH<sub>2</sub>(OH),
into nitrous acid, NO(OH) (Note <a href="#Footnote_25_352">25</a>), by means of an alkaline solution of KMnO<sub>4</sub>, first
obtained hyponitrous acid, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and then a peculiar intermediate acid, N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which,
by further oxidation, gave nitrous acid. On the other hand, Wislicenus (1893) showed
that in the action of the sulphuric acid salt of hydroxylamine upon nitrite of sodium,
there is formed, besides, nitrous oxide (according to V. Meyer, NH<sub>3</sub>O,H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + NaNO<sub>2</sub>
= NaHSO<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>O), a small amount of hyponitrous acid which may be precipitated
in the form of the silver salt; and this reaction is most simply expressed by taking the
doubled formula of hyponitrous acid, NH<sub>2</sub>(OH) + NO(OH) = H<sub>2</sub>O + N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. The best
argument in favour of the doubled formula is the property possessed by hyponitrous acid
of forming acid salts, HNaN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Zorn).</p>

<p>According to Thoune, the following are the properties of hyponitrous acid. When
liberated from the dry silver salt by the action of dry sulphuretted hydrogen, hyponitrous
acid is unstable, and easily explodes even at low temperatures. But when dissolved in
water (having been formed by the action of hydrochloric acid upon the silver salt), it is
stable even when boiled with dilute acids and alkalis. The solution is colourless and
has a strongly acid reaction. In the course of time, however, the aqueous solution also
decomposes into nitrous oxide and water. The complete oxidation by permanganate of
potash proceeds according to the following equation: 5H<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 8KMnO<sub>4</sub> + 12H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
= 10HNO<sub>3</sub> + 4K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 8MnSO<sub>4</sub> + 12H<sub>2</sub>O. In an alkaline solution, KMnO<sub>4</sub> only oxidises
hyponitrous acid into nitrous and not into nitric acid. Nitrous acid has a decomposing
action upon hyponitrous acid, and if the aqueous solutions of the two acids be mixed together
they immediately give off oxides of nitrogen. Hyponitrous acid does not liberate
CO<sub>2</sub> from its salts, but on the other hand it is not displaced by CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_68_402" id="Footnote_68_402"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_402"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> It is remarkable that electro-deposited copper powder gives nitrous oxide with a
10 p.c. solution of nitric acid, whilst ordinary copper gives nitric oxide. It is here
evident that the physical and mechanical structure of the substance affects the course of
the reaction&mdash;that is to say, it is a case of contact-action.</p></div>

must be collected over warm water. The nitrous oxide is much more soluble than nitric

conducted with great care, as the pressure of the nitrous oxide in a liquid state is considerable,
namely (according to Regnault), at +10° = 45 atmospheres, at 0° = 36 atmospheres,
at -10° = 29 atmospheres, and at -20° = 23 atmospheres. It boils at -92°,

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">MOLECULES AND ATOMS. THE LAWS OF GAY-LUSSAC AND AVOGADRO-GERHARDT</span></h2>

<p>Hydrogen combines with oxygen in the proportion of two volumes to
one. The composition by volume of nitrous oxide is exactly similar&mdash;it
is composed of two volumes of nitrogen and one volume of oxygen.
By decomposing ammonia by the action of an electric spark it is easy
to prove that it contains one volume of nitrogen to three volumes of
hydrogen. So, similarly, it is found, whenever a compound is decomposed
and the volumes of the gases proceeding from it are measured,
that the volumes of the gases or vapours entering into combination
are in a very simple proportion to one another. With water, nitrous
oxide, &amp;c., this may be proved by direct observation; but in the majority
of cases, and especially with substances which, although volatile&mdash;that
is, capable of passing into a gaseous (or vaporous) state&mdash;are liquid at
the ordinary temperature, such a direct method of observation presents
many difficulties. But, then, if the densities of the vapours and gases
be known, the same simplicity in their ratio is shown by calculation.
The volume of a substance is proportional to its weight, and inversely
proportional to its density, and therefore by dividing the amount by
weight of each substance entering into the composition of a compound
by its density in the gaseous or vaporous state we shall obtain factors
which will be in the same proportion as the volumes of the substances
entering into the composition of the compound.<a name="FNanchor_1_409" id="FNanchor_1_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_409" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> So, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
water contains eight parts by weight of oxygen to one part by weight
of hydrogen, and their densities are 16 and 1, consequently their
volumes (or the above-mentioned factors) are 1 and &frac12;, and therefore
it is seen without direct experiment that water contains two volumes
of hydrogen for every one volume of oxygen. So also, knowing that
nitric oxide contains fourteen parts of nitrogen and sixteen parts of
oxygen, and knowing that the specific gravities of these last two gases are
fourteen and sixteen, we find that the volumes in which nitrogen and
oxygen combine for the formation of nitric oxide are in the proportion
of 1 : 1. We will cite another example. In the last <a href="#Page_246">chapter</a> we saw
that the density of NO<sub>2</sub> only becomes constant and equal to twenty-three
(referred to hydrogen) above 135°, and as a matterof fact a method
of direct observation of the volumetric composition of this substance
would be very difficult at so high a temperature. But it may be
easily calculated. NO<sub>2</sub>, as is seen from its formula and analysis, contains
thirty-two parts by weight of oxygen to fourteen parts by weight of
nitrogen, forming forty-six parts by weight of NO<sub>2</sub>, and knowing the
densities of these gases we find that one volume of nitrogen with two
volumes of oxygen gives two volumes of nitrogen peroxide. Therefore,
knowing the amounts by weight of the substances participating in a
reaction or forming a given substance, and knowing the density of the
gas or vapour,<a name="FNanchor_2_410" id="FNanchor_2_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_410" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the volumetric relations of the substances acting in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
reaction or entering into the composition of a compound, may be also
determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a><br /><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a><br /><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>Such an investigation (either direct, or by calculation from the densities
and composition) of every chemical reaction, resulting in the formation
of definite chemical compounds, shows that the volumes of the reacting
substances in a gaseous or vaporous state are either equal or are in
simple multiple proportion.<a name="FNanchor_3_411" id="FNanchor_3_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_411" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> This forms the <i>first law</i> of those discovered
by <i>Gay-Lussac</i>. It may be formulated as follows: <i>The amounts of substances
entering into chemical reaction occupy under similar physical
conditions, in a gaseous or vaporous state, equal or simple multiple
volumes.</i> This law refers not only to elements, but also to compounds
entering into mutual chemical combination; thus, for example, one
volume of ammonia gas combines with one volume of hydrogen chloride.
For in the formation of sal-ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, there enter into reaction
17 parts by weight of ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, which is 8·5 times denser than
hydrogen, and 36·5 parts by weight of hydrogen chloride, whose vapour
density is 18·25 times that of hydrogen, as has been proved by direct
experiment. By dividing the weights by the respective densities we
find that the volume of ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, is equal to two, and so also the
volume of hydrogen chloride. Hence the volumes of the compounds
which here combine together are equal to each other. Taking into
consideration that the law of Gay-Lussac holds good, not only for
elements, but also for compounds, it should be expressed as follows:
<i>Substances interact with one another in commensurable volumes of their
vapours.</i><a name="FNanchor_4_412" id="FNanchor_4_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_412" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>The law of combining volumes and the law of multiple proportion
were discovered independently of each other&mdash;the one in France by
Gay-Lussac, the other in England by Dalton&mdash;almost simultaneously.
In the language of the atomic hypothesis it may be said that atomic
quantities of elements occupy equal or multiple volumes.</p>

<p>The first law of Gay-Lussac expresses the relation between the
volumes of the component parts of a compound. Let us now consider
the relation existing between the volumes of the component parts and
of the compounds which proceed from them. This may sometimes be
determined by direct observation. Thus the volume occupied by water,
formed by two volumes of hydrogen and one volume of oxygen, may be
determined by the aid of the apparatus shown in fig. <a href="#fig_56">56</a>. The long
glass tube is closed at the top and open at the bottom, which is
immersed in a cylinder containing mercury. The closed end is
furnished with wires like a eudiometer. The tube is filled with
mercury, and then a certain volume of detonating gas is introduced.
This gas is obtained from the decomposition of water, and therefore in
every three volumes contains two volumes of hydrogen and one volume
of oxygen. The tube is surrounded by a second and wider glass tube,
and the vapour of a substance boiling above 100°&mdash;that is, whose boiling
point is higher than that of water&mdash;is passed through the annular space
between them. Amyl alcohol, whose boiling point is 132°, may be
taken for this purpose. The amyl alcohol is boiled in the vessel to the
right hand and its vapour passed between the walls of the two tubes.
In the case of amyl alcohol the outer glass tube should be connected with
a condenser to prevent the escape into the air of the unpleasant-smelling
vapour. The detonating gas is thus heated up to a temperature of
132°. When its volume becomes constant it is measured, the height of
the column of mercury in the tube above the level of the mercury in the
cylinder being noted. Let this volume equal <i>v</i>; it will therefore contain
&#8531; <i>v</i> of oxygen and &#8532; <i>v</i> of hydrogen. The current of vapour is then
stopped, and the gas exploded; water is formed, which condenses into
a liquid. The volume occupied by the vapour of the water formed has
now to be determined. For this purpose the vapour of the amyl alcohol
is again passed between the tubes, and thus the whole of the water
formed is converted into vapour at the same temperature as that at
which the detonating gas was measured; and the cylinder of mercury
being raised until the column of mercury in the tube stands at the same
height above the surface of the mercury in the cylinder as it did before
the explosion, it is found that the volume of the water formed is equal
to &#8532; <i>v</i>&mdash;that is, it is equal to the volume of the hydrogen contained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a><br /><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
in it. Consequently the volumetric composition of water is expressed
in the following terms: Two volumes of hydrogen combine with
one volume of oxygen to form two volumes of aqueous vapour. For
substances which are gaseous at the ordinary temperature, this direct
method of observation is sometimes very easily conducted; for
instance, with ammonia, nitric and nitrous oxides. Thus to determine
the composition by volume of nitrous oxide, the above-described
apparatus may be employed. Nitrous oxide is introduced into the
tube, and after measuring its volume electric sparks are passed
through the gas; it is then found that two volumes of nitrous oxide
have given three volumes of gases&mdash;namely, two volumes of nitrogen
and one volume of oxygen. Consequently the composition of nitrous
oxide is similar to that of water; two volumes of nitrogen and one
volume of oxygen give two volumes of nitrous oxide. By decomposing
ammonia it is found to be composed in such a manner that two volumes
give one volume of nitrogen and three volumes of hydrogen; also two
volumes of nitric oxide are formed by the union of one volume of oxygen
with one volume of nitrogen. The same relations may be proved by
calculation from the vapour densities, as was described above.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 56.&mdash;Apparatus for demonstrating the volume occupied by the steam
formed from the explosion of detonating gas.</p></div>

<p>Comparisons of various results made by the aid of direct observations
or calculation, an example of which has just been cited, led Gay-Lussac
to the conclusion that <i>the volume of a compound in a gaseous or
vaporous state is always in simple multiple proportion to the volume
of each of the component parts of which it is formed</i> (and consequently
to the sum of the volumes of the elements of which it is formed). This
is the <i>second law of Gay-Lussac</i>; it extends the simplicity of the
volumetric relations to compounds, and is of the same nature as
that presented by the elements entering into mutual combination.
Hence not only the substances forming a given compound, but also
the substances formed, exhibit a simple relation of volume when
measured as vapour or gas.<a name="FNanchor_5_413" id="FNanchor_5_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_413" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>When a compound is formed from two or more components, there
may or may not be a contraction; the volume of the reacting substances
is in this case either equal to or greater than the volume of the resultant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
compound. The reverse is naturally observed in the case of decompositions,
when from one substance there are produced several of
simpler nature. Therefore in the future we shall term <i>combination</i>
a reaction in which a contraction is observed&mdash;that is, a diminution in
the volume of the component bodies in a state of vapour or gas; and
we shall term <i>decomposition</i> a reaction in which an expansion is produced;
while those reactions in which the volumes in a gaseous or
vaporous state remain constant (the volumes being naturally compared
at the same temperature and pressure) we shall term reactions
of <i>substitution</i> or of double decomposition. Thus the transition of
oxygen into ozone is a reaction of combination, the formation of nitrous
oxide from oxygen and nitrogen will also be a combination, the
formation of nitric oxide from the same will be a reaction of substitution,
the action of oxygen on nitric oxide a combination, and
so on.</p>

<p>The degree of contraction produced in the formation of chemical
compounds not unfrequently leads to the possibility of distinguishing
the degree of change which takes place in the chemical character of
the components when combined. In those cases in which a contraction
occurs, the properties of the resultant compound are very different
from the properties of the substances of which it is composed.
Thus ammonia bears no resemblance in its physical or chemical properties
to the elements from which it is derived; a contraction takes
place in a state of vapour, indicating a proximation of the elements&mdash;the
distance between the atoms is diminished, and from gaseous substances
there is formed a liquid substance, or at any rate one which is
easily liquefied. For this reason nitrous oxide formed by the condensation
of two permanent gases is a substance which is somewhat easily
converted into a liquid; again, nitric acid, which is formed from
elements which are permanent gases, is a liquid, whilst, on the contrary,
nitric oxide, which is formed without contraction and is decomposed
without expansion, remains a gas which is as difficult to liquefy as
nitrogen and oxygen. In order to obtain a still more complete idea of
the dependence of the properties of a compound on the properties of
the component substances, it is further necessary to know the quantity
of heat which is developed in the formation of the compound. If this
quantity be large&mdash;as, for example, in the formation of water&mdash;then
the amount of energy in the resultant compound will be considerably
less than the energy of the elements entering into its composition;
whilst, on the contrary, if the amount of heat evolved in the formation
of a compound be small, or if there even be an absorption of heat, as
in the formation of nitrous oxide, then the energy of the elements is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
not destroyed, or is only altered to a slight extent; hence, notwithstanding
the contraction (compression) involved in its formation,
nitrous oxide supports combustion.</p>

<p>The preceding laws were deduced from purely experimental and
empirical data and as such evoke further consequences, as the law of
multiple proportions gave rise to the atomic theory and the law of
equivalents (Chapter <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>.) In view of the atomic conception of the
constitution of substances, the question naturally arises as to what,
then, are the relative volumes proper to those physically indivisible
molecules which chemically react on each other and consist of the
atoms of elements. The simplest possible hypothesis in this respect
would be that the volumes of the molecules of substances are equal; or,
what is the same thing, to suppose that equal volumes of vapours and
gases contain an equal number of molecules. This proposition was
first enunciated by the Italian savant <i>Avogadro</i> in 1810. It was
also admitted by the French physico-mathematician <i>Ampère</i> (1815)
for the sake of simplifying all kinds of physico-mathematical conceptions
respecting gases. But Avogadro and Ampère's propositions were
not generally received in science until Gerhardt in the forties had
applied them to the generalisation of chemical reactions, and had
demonstrated, by aid of a series of phenomena, that the reactions of
substances actually take place with the greatest simplicity, and more
especially that such reactions take place between those quantities of
substances which occupy equal volumes, and until he had stated the
hypothesis in an exact manner and deduced the consequences that
necessarily follow from it. Following Gerhardt, Clausius, in the fifties,
placed this hypothesis of the equality of the number of molecules in
equal volumes of gases and vapours on the basis of the kinetic theory
of gases. At the present day the hypothesis of Avogadro and Gerhardt
lies at the basis of contemporary physical, mechanical, and chemical
conceptions; the consequences arising from it have often been subject
to doubt, but in the end have been verified by the most diverse methods;
and now, when all efforts to refute those consequences have proved
fruitless, the hypothesis must be considered as verified,<a name="FNanchor_6_414" id="FNanchor_6_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_414" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and the <i>law of
Avogadro-Gerhardt</i> must be spoken of as fundamental, and as of great
importance for the comprehension of the phenomena of nature. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
law may now be formulated from two points of view. In the first place,
from a physical aspect: <i>equal volumes of gases</i> (or vapours) at equal temperatures
and pressures <i>contain the same number of molecules</i>&mdash;or of
particles of matter which are neither mechanically nor physically
divisible&mdash;previous to chemical change. In the second place, from a
chemical aspect, the same law may be expressed thus: <i>the quantities of
substances entering into chemical reactions occupy, in a state of vapour,
equal volumes</i>. For our purpose the chemical aspect is the most important,
and therefore, before developing the law and its consequences,
we will consider the chemical phenomena from which the law is deduced
or which it serves to explain.</p>

<p>When two isolated substances interact with each other directly and
easily&mdash;as, for instance, an alkali and an acid&mdash;then it is found that the
reaction is accomplished between quantities which in a gaseous state
occupy equal volumes. Thus ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, reacts directly with
hydrochloric acid, HCl, forming sal-ammoniac, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, and in this
case the 17 parts by weight of ammonia occupy the same volume
as the 36·5 parts by weight of hydrochloric acid.<a name="FNanchor_7_415" id="FNanchor_7_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_415" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Ethylene,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, combines with chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, in only one proportion, forming
ethylene dichloride, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, and this combination proceeds directly
and with great facility, the reacting quantities occupying equal
volumes. Chlorine reacts with hydrogen in only one proportion,
forming hydrochloric acid, HCl, and in this case equal volumes interact
with each other. If an equality of volumes is observed in cases
of combination, it should be even more frequently encountered in
cases of decomposition, taking place in substances which split up into
two others. Indeed, acetic acid breaks up into marsh gas, CH<sub>4</sub>, and
carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, and in the proportions in which they are
formed from acetic acid they occupy equal volumes. Also from
phthalic acid, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, there may be obtained benzoic acid, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,
and carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, and as all the elements of phthalic acid
enter into the composition of these substances, it follows that, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
they cannot re-form it by their direct action on each other (the reaction
is not reversible), still they form the direct products of its decomposition,
and they occupy equal volumes. But benzoic acid, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, is itself
composed of benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, and carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, which also
occupy equal volumes.<a name="FNanchor_8_416" id="FNanchor_8_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_416" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> There is an immense number of similar
examples among those organic substances to whose study Gerhardt
consecrated his whole life and work, and he did not allow such facts as
these to escape his attention. Still more frequently in the phenomena
of substitution, when two substances react on one another, and two are
produced without a change of volume, it is found that the two substances
acting on each other occupy equal volumes as well as each of
the two resultant substances. Thus, in general, reactions of substitution
take place between volatile acids, HX, and volatile alcohols,
R(OH), with the formation of ethereal salts, RX, and water, H(OH),
and the volume of the vapour of the reacting quantities, HX, R(OH),
and RX, is the same as that of water H(OH), whose weight, corresponding
with the formula, 18, occupies 2 volumes, if 1 part by weight
of hydrogen occupy 1 volume and the density of aqueous vapour
referred to hydrogen is 9. Such general examples, of which there are
many,<a name="FNanchor_9_417" id="FNanchor_9_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_417" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> show that the reaction of equal volumes forms a chemical
phenomenon of frequent occurrence, indicating the necessity for
acknowledging the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt.</p>

<p>But the question arises, What is the relation of volumes if the
reaction of two substances takes place in more than one proportion, according
to the law of multiple proportions? A definite answer can only be
given in cases which have been very thoroughly studied. Thus chlorine,
in acting on marsh gas, CH<sub>4</sub>, forms four compounds, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,
CHCl<sub>3</sub>, and CCl<sub>4</sub>, and it may be established by direct experiment that
the substance CH<sub>3</sub>Cl (methylic chloride) precedes the remainder, and
that the latter proceed from it by the further action of chlorine. And
this substance, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, is formed by the reaction of equal volumes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
marsh gas, CH<sub>4</sub>, and chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, according to the equation CH<sub>4</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>
= CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + HCl. A great number of similar cases are met with
amongst organic&mdash;that is, carbon&mdash;compounds. Gerhardt was led to
the discovery of his law by investigating many such reactions, and
by observing that in them the reaction of equal volumes precedes
all others.</p>

<p>But if nitrogen or hydrogen give several compounds with oxygen,
the question proposed above cannot be answered with complete clearness,
because the successive formations of the different combinations
cannot be so strictly defined. It may be supposed, but neither
definitely affirmed nor experimentally confirmed, that nitrogen and
oxygen first give nitric oxide, NO, and only subsequently the brown
vapours N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. Such a sequence in the combination of nitrogen
with oxygen can only be supposed on the basis of the fact that NO
forms N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> directly with oxygen. If it be admitted that NO
(and not N<sub>2</sub>O or NO<sub>2</sub>) be first formed, then this instance would also
confirm the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, because nitric oxide contains
equal volumes of nitrogen and oxygen. So, also, it may be admitted
that, in the combination of hydrogen with oxygen, hydrogen peroxide
is first formed (equal volumes of hydrogen and oxygen), which is decomposed
by the heat evolved into water and oxygen. This explains
the presence of traces of hydrogen peroxide (Chapter <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>.) in almost
all cases of the combustion or oxidation of hydrogenous substances; for
it cannot be supposed that water is first formed and then the peroxide
of hydrogen, because up to now such a reaction has not been
observed, whilst the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is very easily reproduced.<a name="FNanchor_10_418" id="FNanchor_10_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_418" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Thus a whole series of phenomena show that the chemical reaction
of substances actually takes place, as a rule, between equal volumes,
but this does not preclude the possibility of the frequent reaction of unequal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
volumes, although, in this case, it is often possible to discover a
preceding reaction between equal volumes.<a name="FNanchor_11_419" id="FNanchor_11_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_419" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>The law of Avogadro-Gerhardt may also be easily expressed in an
algebraical form. If the weight of a molecule, or of that quantity of a
substance which enters into chemical reaction and occupies in a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
of vapour, according to the law, a volume equal to that occupied by the
molecules of other bodies, be indicated by the letters M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub> ...
or, in general, M, and if the letters D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, ... or, in general, D,
stand for the density or weight of a given volume of the gases or
vapours of the corresponding substances under certain definite conditions
of temperature and pressure, then the law requires that</p>

<p class="title"><span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M<sub>1</sub></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D<sub>1</sub></span>
</span> =

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M<sub>2</sub></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D<sub>2</sub></span>
</span> &#8943; =

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span> = C</p>

<p>where C is a certain constant. This expression shows directly that the
volumes corresponding with the weights M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub> ... M, are equal
to a certain constant, because the volume is proportional to the weight
and inversely proportional to the density. The magnitude of C is
naturally conditioned by and dependent on the units taken for the
expression of the weights of the molecules and the densities. The
weight of a molecule (equal to the sum of the atomic weights of
the elements forming it) is usually expressed by taking the weight
of an atom of hydrogen as unity, and hydrogen is now also chosen
as the unit for the expression of the densities of gases and vapours;
it is therefore only necessary to find the magnitude of the constant
for any one compound, as it will be the same for all others. Let us
take water. Its reacting mass is expressed (conditionally and
relatively) by the formula or molecule H<sub>2</sub>O, for which M = 18, if H = 1,
as we already know from the composition of water. Its vapour
density, or D, compared to hydrogen = 9, and consequently for water
C = 2, and therefore and in general for the molecules of all substances

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span> = 2.</p>

<p>Consequently the weight of a molecule is equal to twice its vapour
density expressed in relation to hydrogen, and conversely <i>the density of
a gas is equal to half the molecular weight referred to hydrogen</i>.</p>

<p>The truth of this may be seen from a very large number of
observed vapour densities by comparing them with the results obtained
by calculation. As an illustration, we may point out that for ammonia,
NH<sub>3</sub>, the weight of the molecule or quantity of the reacting substance,
as well as the composition and weight corresponding with the
formula, is expressed by the figures 14 + 3 = 17. Consequently M = 17.
Hence, according to the law, D = 8·5. And this result is also obtained
by experiment. The density, according to both formula and experiment,
of nitrous oxide, N<sub>2</sub>O, is 22, of nitric acid 15, and of nitric peroxide 23.
In the case of nitrous anhydride, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, as a substance which dissociates
into NO + NO<sub>2</sub>, the density should vary between 38 (so long as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> remains unchanged) and 19 (when NO + NO<sub>2</sub> is obtained).
There are no figures of constant density for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, NHO<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and
many similar compounds which are either wholly or partially decomposed
in passing into vapour. Salts and similar substances either have
no vapour density because they do not pass into vapour (for instance,
potassium nitrate, KNO<sub>3</sub>) without decomposition, or, if they pass
into vapour without decomposing, their vapour density is observed
with difficulty only at very high temperatures. The practical determination
of the vapour density at these high temperatures (for
example, for sodium chloride, ferrous chloride, stannous chloride, &amp;c.)
requires special methods which have been worked out by Sainte-Claire
Deville, Crafts, Nilson and Pettersson, Meyer, Scott, and others.
Having overcome the difficulties of experiment, it is found that the
law of Avogadro-Gerhardt holds good for such salts as potassium
iodide, beryllium chloride, aluminium chloride, ferrous chloride, &amp;c.&mdash;that
is, the density obtained by experiment proves to be equal to half
the molecular weight&mdash;naturally within the limits of experimental
error or of possible deviation from the law.</p>

<p>Gerhardt deduced his law from a great number of examples of
volatile carbon compounds. We shall become acquainted with certain of
them in the following chapters; their entire study, from the complexity
of the subject, and from long-established custom, forms the subject
of a special branch of chemistry termed &lsquo;organic&rsquo; chemistry. With all
these substances the observed and calculated densities are very similar.</p>

<p>When the consequences of a law are verified by a great number of
observations, it should be considered as confirmed by experiment. But
this does not exclude the possibility of <i>apparent</i> deviations. They may
evidently be of two kinds: the fraction

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

may be found to be either
greater or less than 2&mdash;that is, the calculated density may be either
greater or less than the observed density. When the difference between
the results of experiment and calculation falls within the possible errors
of experiment (for example, equal to hundredths of the density), or
within a possible error owing to the laws of gases having an only
approximate application (as is seen from the deviations, for instance,
from the law of Boyle and Mariotte), then the fraction

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

proves but
slightly different from 2 (between 1·9 and 2·2), and such cases
as these may be classed among those which ought to be expected
from the nature of the subject. It is a different matter if the quotient
of

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

be several times, and in general a multiple, <i>greater</i> or less than 2.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
The application of the law must then be explained or it must be
laid aside, because the laws of nature admit of no exceptions. We will
therefore take two such cases, and first one in which the <i>quotient</i>

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

<i>is greater than 2, or the density obtained by experiment is less than is
in accordance with the law</i>.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, as a consequence of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt,
that there is a decomposition in those cases where the volume
of the vapour corresponding with the weight of the amount of a
substance entering into reaction is greater than the volume of two
parts by weight of hydrogen. Suppose the density of the vapour of
water to be determined at a temperature above that at which it is
decomposed, then, if not all, at any rate a large proportion of the water
will be decomposed into hydrogen and oxygen. The density of such a
mixture of gases, or of detonating gas, will be less than that of aqueous
vapour; it will be equal to 6 (compared with hydrogen), because
1 volume of oxygen weighs 16, and 2 volumes of hydrogen 2;
and, consequently, 3 volumes of detonating gas weigh 18 and 1
volume 6, while the density of aqueous vapour = 9. Hence, if the
density of aqueous vapour be determined after its decomposition, the
quotient

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

would be found to be 3 and not 2. This phenomenon
might be considered as a deviation from Gerhardt's law, but this would
not be correct, because it may be shown by means of diffusion through
porous substances, as described in Chapter <a href="#Page_113">II</a>., that water is decomposed
at such high temperatures. In the case of water itself there can
naturally be no doubt, because its vapour density agrees with the law
at all temperatures at which it has been determined.<a name="FNanchor_12_420" id="FNanchor_12_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_420" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But there are
many substances which decompose with great ease directly they are
volatilised, and therefore only exist as solids or liquids, and not in a state
of vapour. There are, for example, many salts of this kind, besides all
definite solutions having a constant boiling point, all the compounds of
ammonia for example, all ammonium salts&mdash;&amp;c. Their vapour
densities, determined by Bineau, Deville, and others, show that they
do not agree with Gerhardt's law. Thus the vapour density of sal-ammoniac,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, is nearly 14 (compared with hydrogen), whilst
its molecular weight is not less than 53·5, whence the vapour
density should be nearly 27, according to the law. The molecule
of sal-ammoniac cannot be less than NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, because it is formed
from the molecules NH<sub>3</sub> and HCl, and contains single atoms of nitrogen
and chlorine, and therefore cannot be divided; it further never
enters into reactions with the molecules of other substances (for instance,
potassium hydroxide, or nitric acid) in quantities of less than 53·5
parts by weight, &amp;c. The calculated density (about 27) is here double
the observed density (about 13·4); hence

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

= 4 and not 2. For this
reason the vapour density of sal-ammoniac for a long time served as
an argument for doubting the truth of the law. But it proved otherwise,
after the matter had been fully investigated. The low density
depends on the decomposition of sal-ammoniac, on volatilising, into
ammonia and hydrogen chloride. The observed density is not that of
sal-ammoniac, but of a mixture of NH<sub>3</sub> and HCl, which should be
nearly 14, because the density of NH<sub>3</sub> = 8·5 and of HCl = 18·2, and
therefore the density of their mixture (in equal volumes) should be about
13·4.<a name="FNanchor_13_421" id="FNanchor_13_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_421" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The actual decomposition of the vapours of sal-ammoniac was
demonstrated by Pebal and Than by the same method as the decomposition
of water, by passing the vapour of sal-ammoniac through a
porous substance. The experiment demonstrating the decomposition
during volatilisation of sal-ammoniac may be made very easily, and is
a very instructive point in the history of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt,
because without its aid it would never have been imagined that sal-ammoniac
decomposed in volatilising, as this decomposition bears all
the signs of simple sublimation; consequently the knowledge of the
decomposition itself was forestalled by the law. The whole aim
and practical use of the discovery of the laws of nature consists in,
and is shown by, the fact that they enable the unknown to be foretold,
the unobserved to be foreseen. The arrangement of the experiment
is based on the following reasoning.<a name="FNanchor_14_422" id="FNanchor_14_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_422" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> According to the law and to
experiment, the density of ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, is 8&frac12;, and of hydrochloric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
acid, HCl, 18&frac14;, if the density of hydrogen = 1. Consequently, in a
mixture of NH<sub>3</sub> and HCl, the ammonia will penetrate much more
rapidly through a porous mass, or a fine orifice, than the heavier hydrochloric
acid, just as in a former experiment the hydrogen penetrated
more rapidly than the oxygen. Therefore, if the vapour of sal-ammoniac
comes into contact with a porous mass, the ammonia will pass through
it in greater quantities than the hydrochloric acid, and this excess of
ammonia may be detected by means of moist red litmus paper, which
should be turned blue. If the vapour of sal-ammoniac were not
decomposed, it would pass through the porous mass as a whole, and the
colour of the litmus paper would not be altered, because sal-ammoniac
is a neutral salt. Thus, by testing with litmus the substances passing
through the porous mass, it may be decided whether the sal-ammoniac
is decomposed or not when passing into vapour. Sal-ammoniac
volatilises at so moderate a temperature that the experiment may be
conducted in a glass tube heated by means of a lamp, an asbestos
plug being placed near the centre of the tube.<a name="FNanchor_15_423" id="FNanchor_15_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_423" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The asbestos forms
a porous mass, which is unaltered at a high temperature. A piece
of dry sal-ammoniac is placed at one side of the asbestos plug,
and is heated by a Bunsen burner. The vapours formed are driven
by a current of air forced from a gasometer or bag through two tubes
containing pieces of moist litmus paper, one blue and one red paper in
each. If the sal-ammoniac be heated, then the ammonia appears on
the opposite side of the asbestos plug, and the litmus there turns
blue. And as an excess of hydrochloric acid remains on the side where
the sal-ammoniac is heated, it turns the litmus at that end red.
This proves that the sal-ammoniac, when converted into vapour,
splits up into ammonia and hydrochloric acid, and at the same time
gives an instance of the possibility of correctly conjecturing a fact on
the basis of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt.<a name="FNanchor_15_BIS_424" id="FNanchor_15_BIS_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_BIS_424" class="fnanchor">[15 bis]</a></p>

<p>So also the fact of a decomposition may be proved in the other
instances where

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

proved greater than 2, and hence the apparent
deviations appear in reality as an excellent proof of the general application
and significance of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>

<p>In those cases where the <i>quotient</i>

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

proves to be <i>less</i> than 2, or
the observed density <i>greater</i> than that calculated, by a multiple number
of times, the matter is evidently more simple, and the fact observed
only indicates that the weight of the molecule is as many times greater
as that taken as the quotient obtained is less than 2. So, for instance,
in the case of ethylene, whose composition is expressed by CH<sub>2</sub>, the
density was found by experiment to be 14, and in the case of amylene,
whose composition is also CH<sub>2</sub>, the density proved to be 35, and
consequently the quotient for ethylene = 1, and for amylene = &#8534;. If
the molecular weight of ethylene be taken, not as 14, as might be
imagined from its composition, but as twice as great&mdash;namely, as 28&mdash;and
for amylene as five times greater&mdash;that is as 70&mdash;then the molecular
composition of the first will be C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and of the second C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, and for
both of them

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

will be equal to 2. This application of the law,
which at first sight may appear perfectly arbitrary, is nevertheless
strictly correct, because the amount of ethylene which reacts&mdash;for
example, with sulphuric and other acids&mdash;is not equal to 14, but to 28
parts by weight. Thus with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>, or HI, &amp;c., ethylene combines
in a quantity C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and amylene in a quantity C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, and not
CH<sub>2</sub>. On the other hand, ethylene is a gas which liquefies with difficulty
(absolute boiling point = +10°), whilst amylene is a liquid boiling
at 35° (absolute boiling point = +192°), and by admitting the greater
density of the molecules of amylene (M = 70) its difference from the
lighter molecules of ethylene (M = 28) becomes clear. Thus, the
smaller quotient

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">M</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">D</span>
</span>

is <i>an indication of polymerisation</i>, as the larger
quotient is of decomposition. The difference between the densities of
oxygen and ozone is a case in point.</p>

<p>On turning to the elements, it is found in certain cases, especially
with metals&mdash;for instance, mercury, zinc, and cadmium&mdash;that that
weight of the atoms which must be acknowledged in their compounds
(of which mention will be afterwards made) appears to be also the
molecular weight. Thus, the atomic weight of mercury must be taken
as = 200, but the vapour density = 100, and the quotient = 2. Consequently
the <i>molecule of mercury contains one atom</i>, Hg. It is the same
with sodium, cadmium, and zinc. This is the simplest possible molecule,
which necessarily is only possible in the case of elements, as the molecule
of a compound must contain at least two atoms. However, the
molecules of many of the elements prove to be complex&mdash;for instance,
the weight of an atom of oxygen = 16, and its density = 16, so that its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
molecule must contain two atoms, O<sub>2</sub>, which might already be concluded
by comparing its density with that of ozone, whose molecule contains
O<sub>3</sub> (Chapter <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>.) So also the molecule of hydrogen equals H<sub>2</sub>, of
chlorine Cl<sub>2</sub>, of nitrogen N<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. If chlorine react with hydrogen, the
volume remains unaltered after the formation of hydrochloric acid,
H<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> = HCl + HCl. It is a case of substitution between the one
and the other, and therefore the volumes remain constant. There are
elements whose molecules are much more complex&mdash;for instance, sulphur,
S<sub>6</sub>&mdash;although, by heating, the density is reduced to a third, and S<sub>2</sub> is
formed. Judging from the vapour density of phosphorus (D = 62)
the molecule contains four atoms P<sub>4</sub>. Hence many elements when
polymerised appear in molecules which are more complex than the
simplest possible. In carbon, as we shall afterwards find, a very
complex molecule must be admitted, as otherwise its non-volatility and
other properties cannot be understood. And if compounds are decomposed
by a more or less powerful heat, and if polymeric substances
are depolymerised (that is, the weight of the molecule diminishes) by a
rise of temperature, as N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> passes into NO<sub>2</sub>, or ozone, O<sub>3</sub>, into ordinary
oxygen, O<sub>2</sub>, then we might expect to find the splitting-up of the complex
molecules of elements into the simplest molecule containing a
single atom only&mdash;that is to say, if O<sub>2</sub> be obtained from O<sub>3</sub>, then
the formation of O might also be looked for. The possibility but not
proof of such a proposition is indicated by the vapour of iodine. Its
normal density = 127 (Dumas, Deville, and others), which corresponds
with the molecule I<sub>2</sub>. At temperatures above 800° (up to which the
density remains almost constant), this density distinctly decreases, as
is seen from the verified results obtained by Victor Meyer, Crafts, and
Troost. At the ordinary pressure and 1,000° it is about 100, at
1,250° about 80, at 1,400° about 75, and apparently it strives to reduce
itself to one-half&mdash;that is, to 63. Under a reduced pressure this
splitting-up, or depolymerisation, of iodine vapour actually reaches
a density<a name="FNanchor_16_425" id="FNanchor_16_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_425" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> of 66, as Crafts demonstrated by reducing the
pressure to 100 mm. and raising the temperature to 1,500°. From this
it may be concluded that at high temperatures and low pressures the
molecule I<sub>2</sub> gradually passes into the molecule I containing one atom
like mercury, and that something similar occurs with other elements at
a considerable rise of temperature, which tends to bring about the
disunion of compounds and the decomposition of complex molecules.<a name="FNanchor_17_426" id="FNanchor_17_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_426" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides these cases of apparent discrepancy from the law of
Avogadro-Gerhardt there is yet a third, which is the last, and is very
instructive. In the investigation of separate substances they have to
be isolated in the purest possible form, and their chemical and physical
properties, and among them the vapour density, then determined.
If it be normal&mdash;that is, if D = M/2&mdash;it often serves as a proof
of the purity of the substance, <i>i.e.</i> of its freedom from all foreign
matter. If it be abnormal&mdash;that is, if D be not equal to M/2&mdash;then for
those who do not believe in the law it appears as a new argument against
it and nothing more; but to those who have already grasped the important
significance of the law it becomes clear that there is some error in the
observation, or that the density was determined under conditions in
which the vapour does not follow the laws of Boyle or Gay-Lussac, or
else that the substance has not been sufficiently purified, and contains
other substances. The law of Avogadro-Gerhardt in that case furnishes
convincing evidence of the necessity of a fresh and more exact research.
And as yet the causes of error have always been found. There are not
a few examples in point in the recent history of chemistry. We will
cite one instance. In the case of pyrosulphuryl chloride, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,
M = 215, and consequently D should = 107·5, instead of which Ogier
and others obtained 53·8&mdash;that is, a density half as great; and further,
Ogier (1882) demonstrated clearly that the substance is not dissociated
by distillation into SO<sub>3</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, or any other two products, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
thus the abnormal density of S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> remained unexplained until D. P.
Konovaloff (1885) showed that the previous investigators were working
with a mixture (containing SO<sub>3</sub>HCl), and that pyrosulphuryl chloride
has a normal density of approximately 107. Had not the law of
Avogadro-Gerhardt served as a guide, the impure liquid would have
still passed as pure; the more so since the determination of the amount
of chlorine could not aid in the discovery of the impurity. Thus, by
following a true law of nature we are led to true deductions.</p>

<p>All cases which have been studied confirm the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt,
and as by it a deduction is obtained, from the determination
of the vapour density (a purely physical property), as to the
weight of the molecule or quantity of a substance entering into
chemical reaction, this law links together the two provinces of learning&mdash;physics
and chemistry&mdash;in the most intimate manner. Besides
which, the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt places the conceptions of <i>molecules</i>
and <i>atoms</i> on a firm foundation, which was previously wanting.
Although since the days of Dalton it had become evident that it was
necessary to admit the existence of the elementary atom (the chemical
individual indivisible by chemical or other forces), and of the groups of
atoms (or molecules) of compounds, indivisible by mechanical and physical
forces; still the relative magnitude of the molecule and atom was not
defined with sufficient clearness. Thus, for instance, the atomic weight
of oxygen might be taken as 8 or 16, or any multiple of these numbers,
and nothing indicated a reason for the acceptation of one rather than
another of these magnitudes;<a name="FNanchor_18_427" id="FNanchor_18_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_427" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> whilst as regards the weights of the
molecules of elements and compounds there was no trustworthy knowledge
whatever. With the establishment of Gerhardt's law the idea of
the molecule was fully defined, as well as the relative magnitude of
the elementary atom.</p>

<p>The chemical particle or <i>molecule must be considered as the</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
<i>quantity of a substance which enters into chemical reaction with other
molecules, and occupies in a state of vapour the same volume as two
parts by weight of hydrogen</i>.</p>

<p>The molecular weight (which has been indicated by M) of a substance
is determined by its composition, transformations, and vapour
density.</p>

<p>The molecule is not divisible by the mechanical and physical
changes of substances, but in chemical reaction it is either altered in
its properties, or quantity, or structure, or in the nature of the motion
of its parts.</p>

<p>An agglomeration of molecules, which are alike in all chemical
respects, makes up the masses of homogeneous substances in all
states.<a name="FNanchor_19_428" id="FNanchor_19_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_428" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Molecules consist of atoms in a certain state of distribution and
motion, just as the solar system<a name="FNanchor_20_429" id="FNanchor_20_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_429" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is made up of inseparable parts
(the sun, planets, satellites, comets, &amp;c.) The greater the number of
atoms in a molecule, the more complex is the resultant substance.
The equilibrium between the dissimilar atoms may be more or less
stable, and may for this reason give more or less stable substances.
Physical and mechanical transformations alter the velocity of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
motion and the distances between the individual molecules, or of the
atoms in the molecules, or of their sum total, but they do not alter the
original equilibrium of the system; whilst chemical changes, on the
other hand, alter the molecules themselves, that is, the velocity of
motion, the relative distribution, and the quality and quantity of the
atoms in the molecules.</p>

<p><i>Atoms are the smallest quantities</i> or chemically indivisible masses
<i>of the elements forming the molecules</i> of elements and compounds.</p>

<p>Atoms have weight, the sum of their weights forms the weight of
the molecule, and the sum of the weights of the molecules forms the
weight of masses, and is the cause of gravity, and of all the phenomena
which depend on the mass of a substance.</p>

<p>The elements are characterised, not only by their independent existence,
their incapacity of being converted into each other, &amp;c., but also
by the weight of their atoms.</p>

<p>Chemical and physical properties depend on the weight, composition,
and properties of the molecules forming a substance, and on the
weight and properties of the atoms forming the molecules.</p>

<p>This is the substance of those principles of molecular mechanics
which lie at the basis of all contemporary physical and chemical
constructions since the establishment of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt.
The fecundity of the principles enunciated is seen at
every step in all the particular cases forming the present store of
chemical data. We will here cite a few examples of the application of
the law.</p>

<p>As the weight of an atom must be understood as the minimum
quantity of an element entering into the composition of all the molecules
formed by it, therefore, in order to find the weight of an atom of
oxygen, let us take the molecules of those of its compounds which have
already been described, together with the molecules of certain of those
carbon compounds which will be described in the <a href="#Page_338">following chapter</a>:</p>

<p>The number of substances taken might be considerably increased,
but the result would be the same&mdash;that is, the molecules of the compounds
of oxygen would never be found to contain less than 16 parts
by weight of this element, but always <i>n</i>16, where <i>n</i> is a whole number.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
The molecular weights of the above compounds are found either directly
from the density of their vapour or gas, or from their reactions. Thus,
the vapour density of nitric acid (as a substance which easily decomposes
above its boiling point) cannot be accurately determined, but the
fact of its containing one part by weight of hydrogen, and all its properties
and reactions, indicate the above molecular composition and no
other. In this manner it is very easy to find the atomic weight of all
the elements, knowing the molecular weight and composition of their
compounds. It may, for instance, be easily proved that less than <i>n</i>12
parts of carbon never enters into the molecules of carbon compounds,
and therefore C must be taken as 12, and not as 6 which was the number
in use before Gerhardt. In a similar manner the atomic weights now
accepted for the elements oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, chlorine, sulphur, &amp;c.,
were found and indubitably established, and they are even now termed
the Gerhardt atomic weights. As regards the metals, many of which do
not give a single volatile compound, we shall afterwards see that there
are also methods by which their atomic weights may be established, but
nevertheless the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt is here also ultimately
resorted to, in order to remove any doubt which may be encountered.
Thus, for instance, although much that was known concerning the
compounds of beryllium necessitated its atomic weight being taken as
Be = 9&mdash;that is, the oxide as BeO and the chloride BeCl<sub>2</sub>&mdash;still certain
analogies gave reason for considering its atomic weight to be Be = 13·5,
in which case its oxide would be expressed by the composition Be<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,
and the chloride by BeCl<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_21_430" id="FNanchor_21_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_430" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It was then found that the vapour density
of beryllium chloride was approximately 40, when it became quite clear
that its molecular weight was 80, and as this satisfies the formula
BeCl<sub>2</sub>, but does not suit the formula BeCl<sub>3</sub>, it therefore became necessary
to regard the atomic weight of Be as 9 and not as 13&frac12;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>With the establishment of a true conception of molecules and
atoms, chemical formulæ became direct expressions, not only of composition,<a name="FNanchor_22_431" id="FNanchor_22_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_431" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
but also of molecular weight or <i>vapour density</i>, and consequently
of a series of fundamental chemical and physical data, inasmuch
as a number of the properties of substances are dependent on their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
vapour density, or molecular weight and composition. The vapour
density D = M/2. For instance, the formula of ethyl ether is C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O,
corresponding with the molecular weight 74, and the vapour density
37, which is the fact. Therefore, the density of vapours and gases has
ceased to be an empirical magnitude obtained by experiment only,
and has acquired a rational meaning. It is only necessary to remember
that 2 grams of hydrogen, or the molecular weight of this primary
gas in grams, occupies, at 0° and 760 mm. pressure, a volume of 22·3
litres (or 22,300 cubic centimetres), in order to directly determine the
weights of cubical measures of gases and vapours from their formulæ,
because <i>the molecular weights in grams of all other vapours at 0° and
760 mm. occupy the same volume, 22·3 litres</i>. Thus, for example, in the
case of carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, the molecular weight M = 44, hence 44
grams of carbonic anhydride at 0° and 760 mm. occupy a volume of
22·3 litres&mdash;consequently, a litre weighs 1·97 gram. By combining the
laws of gases&mdash;Gay-Lussac's, Mariotte's, and Avogadro-Gerhardt's&mdash;we
obtain<a name="FNanchor_23_432" id="FNanchor_23_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_432" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> a general formula for gases</p>

<p class="title">6200<i>s</i>(273 + <i>t</i>) = M<i>p</i></p>

<p>where <i>s</i> is the weight in grams of a cubic centimetre of a vapour or gas
at a temperature <i>t</i> and pressure <i>p</i> (expressed in centimetres of mercury)
if the molecular weight of the gas = M. Thus, for instance, at
100° and 760 millimetres pressure (<i>i.e.</i> at the atmospheric pressure)
the weight of a cubic centimetre of the vapour of ether (M = 74) is
<i>s</i> = 0·0024.<a name="FNanchor_24_433" id="FNanchor_24_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_433" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>As the molecules of many elements (hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
chlorine, bromine, sulphur&mdash;at least at high temperatures) are of uniform
composition, the formulæ of the compounds formed by them
directly indicate the composition by volume. So, for example, the
formula HNO<sub>3</sub> directly shows that in the decomposition of nitric acid
there is obtained 1 vol. of hydrogen, 1 vol. of nitrogen, and 3 vols.
of oxygen.</p>

<p>And since a great number of mechanical, physical, and chemical
properties are directly dependent on the elementary and volumetric
composition, and on the vapour density, the accepted system of atoms
and molecules gives the possibility of simplifying a number of most
complex relations. For instance, it may be easily demonstrated <i>that
the vis viva of the molecules of all vapours and gases is alike</i>. For
it is proved by mechanics that the <i>vis viva</i> of a moving mass = (&frac12;) <i>mv</i><sup>2</sup>,
where <i>m</i> is the mass and <i>v</i> the velocity. For a molecule, <i>m</i> = M, or
the molecular weight, and the velocity of the motion of gaseous
molecules = a constant which we will designate by C, divided by the
square root of the density of the gas<a name="FNanchor_25_434" id="FNanchor_25_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_434" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> = C/&#8730;D, and as D = M/2,
the <i>vis viva</i> of molecules = C<sup>2</sup>&mdash;that is, a constant for all molecules.
<i>Q.E.D.</i><a name="FNanchor_26_435" id="FNanchor_26_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_435" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The specific heat of gases (Chapter <a href="#Page_581">XIV</a>.), and many other
of their properties, are determined by their density, and consequently
by their molecular weight. Gases and vapours in passing into a
liquid state evolve the so-called <i>latent heat</i>, which also proves to be
in connection with the molecular weight. The observed latent heats<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
of carbon bisulphide, CS<sub>2</sub> = 90, of ether, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O, = 94, of benzene,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, = 109, of alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O, = 200, of chloroform, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, = 67,
&amp;c., show the amount of heat expended in converting one part
by weight of the above substances into vapour. A great uniformity
is observed if the measure of this heat he referred to the weight of the
molecule. For carbon bisulphide the formula CS<sub>2</sub> expresses a weight
76, hence the latent heat of evaporation referred to the molecular
quantity CS<sub>2</sub> = 76 x 90 = 6,840, for ether = 9,656, for benzene = 8,502, for
alcohol = 9,200, for chloroform = 8,007, for water = 9,620, &amp;c. That is,
for molecular quantities, the latent heat varies comparatively little,
from 7,000 to 10,000 heat units, whilst for equal parts by weight it
is ten times greater for water than for chloroform and many other
substances.<a name="FNanchor_27_436" id="FNanchor_27_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_436" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>Generalising from the above, the weight of the molecule determines
the properties of a substance <i>independently of its composition</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of
the number and quality of the atoms entering into the molecule&mdash;whenever
the substance is in a gaseous state (for instance, the density
of gases and vapours, the velocity of sound in them, their specific
heat, &amp;c.), or passes into that state, as we see in the latent heat of
evaporation. This is intelligible from the point of view of the atomic
theory in its present form, for, besides a rapid motion proper to the
molecules of gaseous bodies, it is further necessary to postulate that
these molecules are dispersed in space (filled throughout with the
luminiferous ether) like the heavenly bodies distributed throughout
the universe. Here, as there, it is only the degree of removal (the distance)
and the masses of substances which take effect, while those
peculiarities of a substance which are expressed in chemical transformations,
and only come into action on near approach or on contact,
are in abeyance by reason of the dispersal. Hence it is at once obvious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
in the first place, that in the case of solids and liquids, in which the
molecules are closer together than in gases and vapours, a greater
complexity is to be expected, <i>i.e.</i> a dependence of all the properties not
only upon the weight of the molecule but also upon its composition
and quality, or upon the properties of the individual chemical atoms
forming the molecule; and, in the second place, that, in the case of a
small number of molecules of any substance being disseminated through
a mass of another substance&mdash;for example, in the formation of weak
(dilute) solutions (although in this case there is an act of chemical
reaction&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a combination, decomposition, or substitution)&mdash;the dispersed
molecules will alter the properties of the medium in which they
are dissolved, almost in proportion to the molecular weight and almost
independently of their composition. The greater the number of molecules
disseminated&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the stronger the solution&mdash;the more clearly
defined will those properties become which depend upon the composition
of the dissolved substance and its relation to the molecules of the
solvent, for the distribution of one kind of molecules in the sphere
of attraction of others cannot but be influenced by their mutual chemical
reaction. These general considerations give a starting point for explaining
why, since the appearance of Van't Hoff's memoir (1886), &lsquo;The
Laws of Chemical Equilibrium in a Diffused Gaseous or Liquid State&rsquo;
(<i>see</i> Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>), it has been found more and more that <i>dilute</i>
(weak) solutions exhibit such variations of properties as depend wholly
upon the weight and number of the molecules and not upon their composition,
and even give the means of determining the weight of molecules
by studying the variations of the properties of a solvent on the
introduction of a small quantity of a substance passing into solution.
Although this subject has been already partially considered in the <a href="#Page_40">first
chapter</a> (in speaking of solutions), and properly belongs to a special
(physical) branch of chemistry, we touch upon it here because the
meaning and importance of molecular weights are seen in it in a new
and peculiar light, and because it gives a method for determining them
whenever it is possible to obtain dilute solutions. Among the numerous
properties of dilute solutions which have been investigated (for instance,
the osmotic pressure, vapour tension, boiling point, internal friction,
capillarity, variation with change of temperature, specific heat, electroconductivity,
index of refraction, &amp;c.) we will select one&mdash;the &lsquo;depression&rsquo;
or fall of the temperature of freezing (Raoult's cryoscopic method),
not only because this method has been the most studied, but also
because it is the most easily carried out and most frequently applied
for determining the weight of the molecules of substances in solution,
although here, owing to the novelty of the subject there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
also many experimental discrepancies which cannot as yet be explained

<p class="noindent">which shows that for high degrees of dilution (up to 0·25<i>n</i>) <i>d</i> approximately
(estimating the possible errors of experiment at ±0°·005)
= <i>n</i>1·10, because then <i>d</i> = 0°, 0°·0110, 0°·0275, 0°·1100, 0°·2750, 1°·1000,
and the difference between these figures and the results of experiment
for very dilute solutions is less than the possible errors of experiment
(for <i>n</i> = 1 the difference is already greater) and therefore for dilute
solutions of sugar it may be said that <i>n</i> molecules of sugar in dissolving
in 100 molecules of water give a depression of about 1°·1<i>n</i>.
Similar data for acetone (Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_49_96">49</a>) give a depression of
1°·006<i>n</i> for <i>n</i> molecules of acetone per 100 molecules of water. And
in general, for indifferent substances (the majority of organic bodies)
the depression per 100H<sub>2</sub>O is <i>nearly n</i>1°·1 to <i>n</i>1°·0 (ether, for instance,
gives the last number), and consequently in dissolving in 100 grms. of
water it is about 18°·0<i>n</i> to 19°·0<i>n</i>, taking this rule to apply to the
case of a small number of <i>n</i> (not over 0·2<i>n</i>). If instead of water,
other liquid or fused solvents (for example, benzene, acetic acid, acetone,
nitrobenzene or molten naphthaline, metals, &amp;c.) be taken and
in the proportion of 100 molecules of the solvent to <i>n</i> molecules
of a dissolved indifferent (neither acid nor saline) substance, then the
depression is found to be equal to from 0°·62<i>n</i> to 0°·65<i>n</i> and in
general K<i>n</i>. If the molecular weight of the solvent = <i>m</i>, then 100
gram-molecules will weigh 100<i>m</i> grms., and the depression will be
approximately (taking 0·63<i>n</i>) equal to <i>m</i>0·63<i>n</i> degrees for <i>n</i> molecules
of the substance dissolved in 100 grms. of the solvent, or in general the
depression for 100 grms. of a given solvent = <i>kn</i> where <i>k</i> is almost
a constant quantity (for water nearly 18, for acetone nearly 37, &amp;c.) for
all dilute solutions. Thus, having found a convenient solvent for a
given substance and prepared a definite (by weight) solution (<i>i.e.</i> knowing
how many grms. <i>r</i> of the solvent there are to <i>q</i> grms. of the
substance dissolved) and having determined the depression <i>d</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the
fall in temperature of freezing for the solvent&mdash;it is possible to determine
the molecular weight of the substance dissolved, because <i>d</i> = <i>kn</i>
where <i>d</i> is found by experiment and <i>k</i> is determined by the nature
of the solvent, and therefore <i>n</i> or the number of molecules of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>

of hydrogen the molecule contains HO or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is
obtained). Moreover, attention should be drawn to the fact that
a great many substances taken as solvents give per 100 molecules
a depression of about 0·63<i>n</i>, whilst water gives about 1·05<i>n</i>, <i>i.e.</i> a

<p>Thus not only in vapours and gases, but also in dilute solutions of
solid and liquid substances, we see that if not all, still many properties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
are wholly dependent upon the molecular weight and not upon the quality
of a substance, and that this gives the possibility of determining the
weight of molecules by studying these properties (for instance, the vapour
density, depression of the freezing point, &amp;c.) It is apparent from the
foregoing that the physical and even more so the chemical properties of
homogeneous substances, more especially solid and liquid, do not depend
exclusively upon the weights of their molecules, but that many are in
definite (<i>see</i> Chapter XV.) dependence upon the weights of the atoms
of the elements entering into their composition, and are determined by
their quantitative and individual peculiarities. Thus the density of
solids and liquids (as will afterwards be shown) is chiefly determined
by the weights of the atoms of the elements entering into their composition,
inasmuch as dense elements (in a free state) and compounds are
only met with among substances containing elements with large atomic
weights, such as gold, platinum, and uranium. And these elements
themselves, in a free state, are the heaviest of all elements. Substances
containing such light elements as hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen
(like many organic substances) never have a high specific gravity; in
the majority of cases it scarcely exceeds that of water. The density
generally decreases with the increase of the amount of hydrogen, as the
lightest element, and a substance is often obtained lighter than water.
The refractive power of substances also entirely depends on the composition
and the properties of the component elements.<a name="FNanchor_29_BIS_441" id="FNanchor_29_BIS_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_BIS_441" class="fnanchor">[29 bis]</a> The history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
of chemistry presents a striking example in point&mdash;Newton foresaw
from the high refractive index of the diamond that it would contain
a combustible substance since so many combustible oils have a high
refractive power. We shall afterwards see (Chapter XV.) that
many of those properties of substances which are in direct dependence
not upon the weight of the molecules but upon their composition, or, in
other words, upon the properties and quantities of the elements entering
into them, stand in a peculiar (periodic) dependence upon the
atomic weight of the elements; that is, the mass (of molecules and
atoms), proportional to the weight, determines the properties of
substances as it also determines (with the distance) the motions of the
heavenly bodies.</p>

<p>If we know the weight <i>p</i> and volume <i>v</i>, occupied by the vapour of a given substance
at a temperature <i>t</i> and pressure <i>h</i>, then its density may be directly obtained by dividing
<i>p</i> by the weight of a volume <i>v</i> of hydrogen (if the density be expressed according to
hydrogen, <i>see</i> Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_23_147">23</a>) at <i>t</i> and <i>h</i>. Hence, the methods of determining the
density of vapours and gases are based on the determination of <i>p</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>t</i>, and <i>h</i>. The two
last data (the temperature <i>t</i> and pressure <i>h</i>) are given by the thermometer and barometer
and the heights of mercury or other liquid confining the gas, and therefore do not
require further explanation. It need only be remarked that: (1) In the case of easily
volatile liquids there is no difficulty in procuring a bath with a constant temperature,
but that it is nevertheless best (especially considering the inaccuracy of thermometers)
to have a medium of absolutely constant temperature, and therefore to take either a
bath in which some substance is melting&mdash;such as melting ice at 0° or crystals of
sodium acetate, melting at +56°&mdash;or, as is more generally practised, to place the vessel
containing the substance to be experimented with in the vapour of a liquid boiling at a
definite temperature, and knowing the pressure under which it is boiling, to determine
the temperature of the vapour. For this purpose the boiling points of water at different
pressures are given in Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_11_57">11</a>, and the boiling points of certain easily procurable
liquids at various pressures are given in Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_27_151">27</a>. (2) With respect to temperatures
above 300° (below which mercurial thermometers may be conveniently employed),
they are most simply obtained constant (to give time for the weight and volume of a
substance being observed in a given space, and to allow that space to attain the calculated
temperature <i>t</i>) by means of substances boiling at a high temperature. Thus, for
instance, at the ordinary atmospheric pressure the temperature <i>t</i> of the vapour of
sulphur is about 445°, of phosphorus pentasulphide 518°, of tin chloride 606°, of cadmium
770°, of zinc 930° (according to Violle and others), or 1040° (according to Deville),
&amp;c. (3) The indications of the hydrogen thermometer must be considered as the most
exact (but as hydrogen diffuses through incandescent platinum, nitrogen is usually
employed). (4) The temperature of the vapours used as the bath should in every case
be several degrees higher than the boiling point of the liquid whose density is to be
determined, in order that no portion should remain in a liquid state. But even in this
case, as is seen from the example of nitric peroxide (Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>.), the vapour density
does not always remain constant with a change of <i>t</i>, as it should were the law of the
expansion of gases and vapours absolutely exact (Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_26_150">26</a>). If variations of
a chemical and physical nature similar to that which we saw in nitric peroxide take
place in the vapours, the main interest is centred in <i>constant</i> densities, which do not
vary with <i>t</i>, and therefore the possible effect of <i>t</i> on the density must always be kept
in mind in having recourse to this means of investigation. (5) Usually, for the sake of
convenience of observation, the vapour density is determined at the atmospheric pressure
which is read on the barometer; but in the case of substances which are volatilised
with difficulty, and also of substances which decompose, or, in general, vary at
temperatures near their boiling points, it is best or even indispensable to conduct the determination
at low pressures, whilst for substances which decompose at low pressures the
observations have to be conducted under a more or less considerably increased pressure.
(6) In many cases it is convenient to determine the vapour density of a substance in
admixture with other gases, and consequently under the partial pressure, which may be
calculated from the volume of the mixture and that of the intermixed gas (<i>see</i> Chapter I.,
Note 1). This method is especially important for substances which are easily decomposable,
because, as shown by the phenomena of dissociation, a substance is able to remain
unchanged in the atmosphere of one of its products of decomposition. Thus, Wurtz
determined the density of phosphoric chloride, PCl<sub>5</sub>, in admixture with the vapour of
phosphorous chloride, PCl<sub>3</sub>. (7) It is evident, from the example of nitric peroxide, that
a change of pressure may alter the density and aid decomposition, and therefore identical
results are sometimes obtained (if the density be variable) by raising <i>t</i> and lowering <i>h</i>;
but if the density does not vary under these variable conditions (at least, to an
extent appreciably exceeding the limits of experimental error), then this <i>constant</i> density
indicates the <i>gaseous</i> and <i>invariable</i> state of a substance. The laws hereafter laid down
refer only to such vapour densities. But the majority of volatile substances show such
a constant density at a certain degree above their boiling points up to the starting point
of decomposition. Thus, the density of aqueous vapour does not vary for <i>t</i> between
the ordinary temperature and 1000° (there are no trustworthy determinations beyond
this) and for pressures varying from fractions of an atmosphere up to several atmospheres.
If, however, the density does vary considerably with a variation of <i>h</i> and <i>t</i>,
the fact may serve as a guide for the investigation of the chemical changes which are
undergone by the substance in a state of vapour, or at least as an indication of a
deviation from the laws of Boyle, Mariotte, and Gay-Lussac (for the expansion of gases
with <i>t</i>). In certain cases the separation of one form of deviation from the other may be
explained by special hypotheses.</p>

<p>With respect to the means of determining <i>p</i> and <i>v</i>, with a view to finding the vapour
density, we may distinguish three chief methods: (<i>a</i>) by weight, by ascertaining the
weight of a definite volume of vapour; (<i>b</i>) by volume, by measuring the volume occupied
by the vapour of a definite weight of a substance; and (<i>c</i>) by displacement. The last-mentioned
is essentially volumetric, because a known weight of a substance is taken,
and the volume of the air displaced by the vapour at a given <i>t</i> and <i>h</i> is determined.</p>

<p>The method by weight (<i>a</i>) is the most trustworthy and historically important. <i>Dumas'
method</i> is typical. An ordinary spherical glass or porcelain vessel, like those shown
respectively in figs. <a href="#fig_52">52</a> and <a href="#fig_54">54</a>, is taken, and an excess of the substance to be experimented
upon is introduced into it. The vessel is heated to a temperature <i>t</i> higher than the boiling
point of the liquid: this gives a vapour which displaces the air, and fills the spherical
space. When the air and vapour cease escaping from the sphere, it is fused up or
closed by some means; and when cool, the weight of the vapour remaining in the sphere
is determined (either by direct weighing of the vessel with the vapour and introducing
the necessary corrections for the weight of the air and of the vapour itself, or the
weight of the volatilised substance is determined by chemical methods), and the volume
of the vapour at <i>t</i> and the barometric pressure <i>h</i> are then calculated.</p>

<p><i>The volumetric method</i> (<i>b</i>) originally employed by Gay-Lussac and then modified by
Hofmann and others is based on the principle that a weighed quantity of the liquid to
be experimented with (placed in a small closed vessel, which is sometimes fused up before
weighing, and, if quite full of the liquid, breaks when heated in a vacuum) is introduced
into a graduated cylinder heated to <i>t</i>, or simply into a Torricellian vacuum, as
shown in fig. <a href="#fig_54">54</a>, and the number of volumes occupied by the vapour noted when the
space holding it is heated to the desired temperature <i>t</i>. </p>

<p><i>The method of displacement</i> (<i>c</i>) proposed by Victor Meyer is based on the fact that a
space <i>b</i> is heated to a constant temperature <i>t</i> (by the surrounding vapours of a liquid of
constant boiling point), and the air (or other gas enclosed in this space) is allowed to
attain this temperature, and when it has done so a glass bulb containing a weighed quantity
of the substance to be experimented with is dropped into the space. The substance
is immediately converted into vapour, and displaces the air into the graduated cylinder <i>e</i>.
The amount of this air is calculated from its volume, and hence the volume at <i>t</i>, and
therefore also the volume occupied by the vapour, is found. The general arrangement
of the apparatus is given in fig. <a href="#fig_55">55</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_411" id="Footnote_3_411"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_411"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Vapours and gases, as already explained in the <a href="#Page_113">second chapter</a>, are subject to the
same laws, which are, however, only approximate. It is evident that for the deduction
of the laws which will presently be enunciated it is only possible to take into consideration
a perfect gaseous state (far removed from the liquid state) and chemical invariability in
which the <i>vapour density is constant</i>&mdash;that is, the volume of a given gas or vapour
varies like a volume of hydrogen, air, or other gas, with the pressure and temperature.</p>

<p>It is necessary to make this statement in order that it may be clearly seen that the
laws of gaseous volumes, which we shall describe presently, are in the most intimate
connection with the laws of the variations of volumes with pressure and temperature.
And as these latter laws (Chapter <a href="#Page_113">II</a>.) are not infallible, but only approximately exact, the
same, therefore, applies to the laws about to be described. And as it is possible to find
more exact laws (a second approximation) for the variation of <i>v</i> with <i>p</i> and <i>t</i> (for example,
van der Waals' formula, Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_33_157">33</a>), so also a more exact expression of the
relation between the composition and the density of vapours and gases is also possible.
But to prevent any doubt arising at the very beginning as to the breadth and general
application of the laws of volumes, it will be sufficient to mention that the density of
such gases as oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic anhydride is already known to <i>remain
constant</i> (within the limits of experimental error) between the ordinary temperature
and a white heat; whilst, judging from what is said in my work on the &lsquo;Tension of Gases&rsquo;
(vol. i. p. 9), it may be said that, as regards pressure, the relative density remains very
constant, even when the deviations from Mariotte's law are very considerable. However,
in this respect the number of data is as yet too small to arrive at an exact conclusion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_412" id="Footnote_4_412"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_412"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> We must recollect that this law is only approximate, like Boyle and Mariotte's law,
and that, therefore, like the latter, a more exact expression may be found for the
exceptions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_413" id="Footnote_5_413"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_413"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> This second law of volumes may be considered as a consequence of the first law.
The first law requires simple ratios between the volumes of the combining substances <i>A</i>
and <i>B</i>. A substance <i>AB</i> is produced by their combination. It may, according to the
law of multiple proportion, combine, not only with substances <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, &amp;c., but also with <i>A</i>
and with <i>B</i>. In this new combination the volume of <i>AB</i>, combining with the volume of
<i>A</i>, should be in simple multiple proportion with the volume of <i>A</i>; hence the volume of
the compound <i>AB</i> is in simple proportion to the volume of its component parts. Therefore
only one law of volumes need be accepted. We shall afterwards see that there is a
third law of volumes embracing also the two first laws.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_414" id="Footnote_6_414"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_414"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> It must not be forgotten that Newton's law of gravity was first a hypothesis, but it
became a trustworthy, perfect theory, and acquired the qualities of a fundamental law
owing to the concord between its deductions and actual facts. All laws, all theories, of
natural phenomena, are at first hypotheses. Some are rapidly established by their consequences
exactly agreeing with facts; others only take root by slow degrees; and there
are many which are destined to be refuted owing to their consequences being found to
be at variance with facts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_415" id="Footnote_7_415"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_415"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> This is not only seen from the above calculations, but may be proved by experiment.
A glass tube, divided in the middle by a stopcock, is taken and one portion filled with
<i>dry</i> hydrogen chloride (the dryness of the gases is very necessary, because ammonia
and hydrogen chloride are both very soluble in water, so that a small trace of water
may contain a large amount of these gases in solution) and the other with dry ammonia,
under the atmospheric pressure. One orifice (for instance, of that portion which contains
the ammonia) is firmly closed, and the other is immersed under mercury, and the cock is
then opened. Solid sal-ammoniac is formed, but if the volume of one gas be greater
than that of the other, some of the first gas will remain. By immersing the tube in the
mercury in order that the internal pressure shall equal the atmospheric pressure, it may
easily be shown that the volume of the remaining gas is equal to the difference between
the volumes of the two portions of the tube, and that this remaining gas is part of
that whose volume was the greater.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_416" id="Footnote_8_416"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_416"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Let us demonstrate this by figures. From 122 grams of benzoic acid there are
obtained (<i>a</i>) 78 grams of benzene, whose density referred to hydrogen = 39, hence the
relative volume = 2; and (<i>b</i>) 44 grams of carbonic anhydride, whose density = 22, and
hence the volume = 2. It is the same in other cases.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_417" id="Footnote_9_417"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_417"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> A large number of such generalised reactions, showing reaction by equal
volumes, occur in the case of the hydrocarbon derivatives, because many of these compounds
are volatile. The reactions of alkalis on acids, or anhydrides on water, &amp;c.,
which are so frequent between mineral substances, present but few such examples,
because many of these substances are not volatile and their vapour densities are
unknown. But essentially the same is seen in these cases also; for instance, sulphuric
acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, breaks up into the anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>, and water, H<sub>2</sub>O, which exhibit an equality
of volumes. Let us take another example where three substances combine in equal
volumes: carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, and water, H<sub>2</sub>O (the volumes of all are
equal to 2), form acid ammonium carbonate, (NH<sub>4</sub>)HCO<sub>3</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_418" id="Footnote_10_418"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_418"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> This opinion which I have always held (since the first editions of this work), as to the
primary origin of hydrogen peroxide and of the formation of water by means of its
decomposition, has in latter days become more generally accepted, thanks more especially
to the work of Traube. Probably it explains most simply the necessity for the presence
of traces of water in many reactions, as, for instance, in the explosion of carbonic oxide
with oxygen, and perhaps the theory of the explosion of detonating gas itself and of the
combustion of hydrogen will gain in clearness and truth if we take into consideration the
preliminary formation of hydrogen peroxide and its decomposition. We may here point
out the fact that Ettingen (at Dorpat, 1888) observed the existence of currents and
waves in the explosion of detonating gas by taking photographs, which showed the
periods of combustion and the waves of explosion, which should be taken into consideration
in the theory of this subject. As the formation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>
corresponds with a less amount of heat than the formation of water from H<sub>2</sub> and O, it
may be that the temperature of the flame of detonating gas depends on the pre-formation
of hydrogen peroxide.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_419" id="Footnote_11_419"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_419"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The possibility of reactions between unequal volumes, notwithstanding the general
application of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, may, in addition to what has been said
above, depend on the fact that the participating substances, at the moment of reaction,
undergo a preliminary modification, decomposition, isomeric (polymeric) transformation,
&amp;c. Thus, if NO<sub>2</sub>, seems to proceed from N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, if O<sub>2</sub> is formed from O<sub>3</sub>, and the converse,
then it cannot be denied that the production of molecules containing only one atom is
also possible&mdash;for instance, of oxygen&mdash;as also of higher polymeric forms&mdash;as the
molecule N from N<sub>2</sub>, or H<sub>3</sub> from H<sub>2</sub>. In this manner it is obviously possible, by means
of a series of hypotheses, to explain the cases of the formation of ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, from
3 vols. of hydrogen and 1 vol. of nitrogen. But it must be observed that perhaps our
information in similar instances is, as yet, far from being complete. If hydrazine
or diamide N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> (Chapter VI. Note <a href="#Footnote_20_BIS_346">20 bis</a>) is formed and the imide N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> in which 2 vols.
of hydrogen are combined with 2 vols. of nitrogen, then the reaction here perhaps first
takes place between equal volumes. If it be shown that diamide gives nitrogen and
ammonia (3N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> = N<sub>2</sub> + 4NH<sub>3</sub>) under the action of sparks, heat, or the silent discharge,
&amp;c., then it will be possible to admit that it is formed before ammonia. And perhaps
the still less stable imide N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, which may also decompose with the formation of
ammonia, is produced before the amide N<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>.</p>

<p>I mention this to show that the fact of apparent exceptions existing to the law of
reactions between equal volumes does not prove the impossibility of their being included
under the law on further study of the subject. Having put forward a certain law or hypothesis,
consequences must be deduced from it, and if by their means clearness and consistency
are attained&mdash;and especially, if by their means that which could not otherwise be
known can be predicted&mdash;then the consequences verify the hypothesis. This was the case
with the law now under discussion. The mere simplicity of the deduction of the weights
proper to the atoms of the elements, or the mere fact that having admitted the law it
follows (as will afterwards be shown) that the <i>vis viva</i> of the molecules of all gases is
a constant quantity, is quite sufficient reason for retaining the hypothesis, if not for
believing in it as a fact beyond doubt. And such is the whole doctrine of atoms. And
since by the acceptance of the law it became possible to foretell even the properties and
atomic weights of elements which had not yet been discovered, and these predictions
afterwards proved to be in agreement with the actual facts, it is evident that the law of
Avogadro-Gerhardt penetrates deeply into the nature of the chemical relation of substances.
This being granted, it is possible at the present time to exhibit and deduce the
truth under consideration in many ways, and in every case, like all that is highest in
science (for example, the laws of the indestructibility of matter, of the conservation of
energy, of gravity, &amp;c.), it proves to be not an empirical conclusion from direct observation
and experiment, not a direct result of analysis, but a creation, or instinctive penetration,
of the inquiring mind, guided and directed by experiment and observation&mdash;a synthesis
of which the exact sciences are capable equally with the highest forms of art. Without
such a synthetical process of reasoning, science would only be a mass of disconnected
results of arduous labour, and would not be distinguished by that vitality with which
it is really endowed when once it succeeds in attaining a synthesis, or concordance of
outward form with the inner nature of things, without losing sight of the diversities
of individual parts; in short, when it discovers by means of outward phenomena, which
are apparent to the sense of touch, to observation, and to the common mind, the internal
signification of things&mdash;discovering simplicity in complexity and uniformity in diversity.
And this is the highest problem of science.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_420" id="Footnote_12_420"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_420"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> As the density of aqueous vapour remains constant within the limits of experimental
accuracy, even at 1,000°, when dissociation has certainly commenced, it would
appear that only a very small amount of water is decomposed at these temperatures.
If even 10 p.c. of water were decomposed, the density would be 8·57 and the quotient
M/D = 2·1, but at the high temperatures here concerned the error of experiment is not
greater than the difference between this quantity and 2. And probably at 1,000° the
dissociation is far from being equal to 10 p.c. <i>Hence the variation in the vapour density

begun; it was, for instance, given in my work on <i>Specific Volumes</i>, 1856, p. 99. The

chlorine, it was afterwards proved that if there is a decrease of density it is only a small
one. In the case of bromine it is not much greater, and is far from being equal to
that for iodine.</p>

<p>As in general we very often involuntarily confuse chemical processes with physical,
it may be that a physical process of change in the coefficient of expansion with a change
of temperature participates with a change in molecular weight, and partially, if not
wholly, accounts for the decrease of the density of chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Thus,
I have remarked (Comptes Rendus, 1876) that the coefficient of expansion of gases
increases with their molecular weight, and (Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_26_150">26</a>) the results of direct
experiment show the coefficient of expansion of hydrobromic acid (M = 81) to be 0·00386
instead of 0·00367, which is that of hydrogen (M = 2). Hence, in the case of the vapour
of iodine (M = 254) a very large coefficient of expansion is to be expected, and from this
cause alone the relative density would fall. As the molecule of chlorine Cl<sub>2</sub> is lighter (= 71)
than that of bromine (= 160), which is lighter than that of iodine (= 254), we see that
the order in which the decomposability of the vapours of these haloids is observed corresponds
with the expected rise in the coefficient of expansion. Taking the coefficient of
expansion of iodine vapour as 0·004, then at 1,000° its density would be 116. Therefore
the dissociation of iodine may be only an apparent phenomenon. However, on the other
hand, the heavy vapour of mercury (M = 200, D = 100) scarcely decreases in density at
a temperature of 1,500° (D = 98, according to Victor Meyer); but it must not be forgotten
that the molecule of mercury contains only one atom, whilst that of iodine contains
two, and this is very important. Questions of this kind which are difficult to decide by
experimental methods must long remain without a certain explanation, owing to the
difficulty, and sometimes impossibility, of distinguishing between physical and chemical
changes.</p></div>

case would be HO and hydrogen peroxide HO<sub>2</sub>, and in the second case, as is now generally
accepted, water H<sub>2</sub>O and hydrogen peroxide H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or HO. Disagreement and confusion
reigned. In 1860 the chemists of the whole world met at Carlsruhe for the purpose
of arriving at some agreement and uniformity of opinion. I was present at this Congress,
and well remember how great was the difference of opinion, and how a compromise was
advocated with great acumen by many scientific men, and with what warmth the followers
of Gerhardt, at whose head stood the Italian professor, Canizzaro, followed up the consequences
of the law of Avogadro. In the spirit of scientific freedom, without which
science would make no progress, and would remain petrified as in the middle ages, and
with the simultaneous necessity of scientific conservatism, without which the roots of
past study could give no fruit, a compromise was not arrived at, nor ought it to have
been, but instead of it truth, in the form of the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, received by
means of the Congress a wider development, and soon afterwards conquered all minds.
Then the new so-called Gerhardt atomic weights established themselves, and in the
seventies they were already in general use.</p></div>

of a number of molecules, in a state of continual motion (like the stars of the Milky
Way), distributing themselves evenly or forming new systems. If the aggregation of all
kinds of heterogeneous molecules be possible in a gaseous state, where the molecules
are considerably removed from each other, then in a liquid state, where they are already
close together, such an aggregation becomes possible only in the sense of the mutual
reaction between them which results from their chemical attraction, and especially in
the aptitude of heterogeneous molecules for combining together. Solutions and other
so-called indefinite chemical compounds should be regarded in this light. According
to the principles developed in this work we should regard them as containing both
the compounds of the heterogeneous molecules themselves and the products of their
decomposition, as in peroxide of nitrogen, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub>. And we must consider that
those molecules A, which at a given moment are combined with B in AB, will in
the following moment become free in order to again enter into a combined form. The
laws of chemical equilibrium proper to dissociated systems cannot be regarded in any
other light.</p></div>

observations, experiments, laws, hypotheses, and theories, at a comprehension of the
internal and invisible structure of concrete substances with that same degree of clearness
and exactitude which has been attained in the visible structure of the heavenly bodies.
It is not many years ago since the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt took root in science. It is
within the memory of many living scientific men, and of mine amongst others. It is not
surprising, therefore, that as yet little progress has been made in the province of
molecular mechanics; but the theory of gases alone, which is intimately connected with
the conception of molecules, shows by its success that the time is approaching when our
knowledge of the internal structure of matter will be defined and established.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_430" id="Footnote_21_430"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_430"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> If Be = 9, and beryllium chloride be BeCl<sub>2</sub>, then for every 9 parts of beryllium
there are 71 parts of chlorine, and the molecular weight of BeCl<sub>2</sub> = 80; hence the vapour
density should be 40 or <i>n</i>40. If Be = 13·5, and beryllium chloride be BeCl<sub>3</sub>, then to 13·5
of beryllium there are 106·5 of chlorine; hence the molecular weight would be 120, and
the vapour density 60 or <i>n</i>60. The composition is evidently the same in both cases,
because 9 : 71 &#8759; 13·5 : 106·5. Thus, if the symbol of an element designate different
atomic weights, apparently very different formulæ may equally well express both the
percentage composition of compounds, and those properties which are required by the
laws of multiple proportions and equivalents. The chemists of former days accurately
expressed the composition of substances, and accurately applied Dalton's laws, by
taking H = 1, O = 8, C = 6, Si = 14, &amp;c. The Gerhardt equivalents are also satisfied by
them, because O = 16, C = 12, Si = 28, &amp;c., are multiples of them. The choice of one or
the other multiple quantity for the atomic weight is impossible without a firm and concrete
conception of the molecule and atom, and this is only obtained as a consequence of
the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, and hence the modern atomic weights are the results
of this law (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_28_438">28</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_431" id="Footnote_22_431"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_431"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> The percentage amounts of the elements contained in a given compound may be
calculated from its formula by a simple proportion. Thus, for example, to find the
percentage amount of hydrogen in hydrochloric acid we reason as follows:&mdash;HCl shows
that hydrochloric acid contains 35·5 of chlorine and 1 part of hydrogen. Hence, in 36·5
parts of hydrochloric acid there is 1 part by weight of hydrogen, consequently 100 parts
by weight of hydrochloric acid will contain as many more units of hydrogen as 100 is
greater than 36·5; therefore, the proportion is as follows&mdash;<i>x</i> : 1 &#8759; 100 : 36·5 or <i>x</i> =

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">100</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">36·5</span>
</span>

= 2·739. Therefore 100 parts of hydrochloric acid contain 2·739 parts of hydrogen. In
general, when it is required to transfer a formula into its percentage composition, we
must replace the symbols by their corresponding atomic weights and find their sum, and
knowing the amount by weight of a given element in it, it is easy by proportion to find
the amount of this element in 100 or any other quantity of parts by weight. If, on the
contrary, it be required to find the formula from a given percentage composition, we must
proceed as follows: Divide the percentage amount of each element entering into the
composition of a substance by its atomic weight, and compare the figures thus obtained&mdash;they
should be in simple multiple proportion to each other. Thus, for instance,
from the percentage composition of hydrogen peroxide, 5·88 of hydrogen and 94·12 of
oxygen, it is easy to find its formula; it is only necessary to divide the amount of
hydrogen by unity and the amount of oxygen by 16. The numbers 5·88 and 5·88 are
thus obtained, which are in the ratio 1 : 1, which means that in hydrogen peroxide there
is one atom of hydrogen to one atom of oxygen.</p>

<p>The following is a proof of the practical rule given above <i>that to find the ratio of the
number of atoms from the percentage composition, it is necessary to divide the percentage
amounts by the atomic weights of the corresponding substances, and to find
the ratio which these numbers bear to each other</i>. Let us suppose that two radicles
(simple or compound), whose symbols and combining weights are A and B, combine
together, forming a compound composed of <i>x</i> atoms of A and <i>y</i> atoms of B. The
formula of the substance will be A<i>x</i>B<i>y</i>. From this formula we know that our compound
contains <i>x</i>A parts by weight of the first element, and <i>y</i>B of the second. In 100 parts of
our compound there will be (by proportion)

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">100.<i>x</i>A</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>x</i>A + <i>y</i>B</span>
</span>

of the first element, and

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">100.<i>y</i>B</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>x</i>A + <i>y</i>B</span>
</span>

of the second. Let us divide these quantities, expressing the percentage amounts by the
corresponding combining weights; we then obtain

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">100<i>x</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>x</i>A + <i>y</i>B</span>
</span>

for the first element and

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">100<i>y</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>x</i>A + <i>y</i>B</span>
</span>

for the second element. And these numbers are in the ratio <i>x</i> : <i>y</i>&mdash;that is, in
the ratio of the number of atoms of the two substances.</p>

<p>It may be further observed that even the very language or nomenclature of chemistry
acquires a particular clearness and conciseness by means of the conception of molecules,
because then the names of substances may directly indicate their composition. Thus
the term &lsquo;carbon dioxide&rsquo; tells more about and expresses CO<sub>2</sub> better than carbonic acid
gas, or even carbonic anhydride. Such nomenclature is already employed by many. But
expressing the composition without an indication or even hint as to the properties, would
be neglecting the advantageous side of the present nomenclature. Sulphur dioxide,
SO<sub>2</sub>, expresses the same as barium dioxide, BaO<sub>2</sub>, but sulphurous anhydride indicates
the acid properties of SO<sub>2</sub>. Probably in time one harmonious chemical language will
succeed in embracing both advantages.</p></div>

somewhat modified form in the &lsquo;Comptes Rendus,&rsquo; Feb. 1876) is deduced in the following
manner. According to the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt, M = 2D for all gases, where M is
the molecular weight and D the density referred to hydrogen. But it is equal to the
weight <i>s</i><sub>0</sub> of a cubic centimetre of a gas in grams at 0° and 76 cm. pressure, divided by
0·0000898, for this is the weight in grams of a cubic centimetre of hydrogen. But the
weight <i>s</i> of a cubic centimetre of a gas at a temperature <i>t</i> and under a pressure <i>p</i>
(in centimetres) is equal to <i>s</i><sub>0</sub><i>p</i>/76(1 + <i>at</i>). Therefore, <i>s</i><sub>0</sub> = <i>s</i>.76(1 + <i>at</i>)/<i>p</i>; hence D =
76.<i>s</i>(1 + <i>at</i>)/0·0000898<i>p</i>, whence M = 152<i>s</i>(1 + <i>at</i>)/0·0000898<i>p</i>, which gives the above expression,
because 1/<i>a</i> = 273, and 152 multiplied by 273 and divided by 0·0000898 is nearly 6200.
In place of <i>s</i>, <i>m/v</i> may be taken, where <i>m</i> is the weight and <i>v</i> the volume of a vapour.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_433" id="Footnote_24_433"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_433"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> The above formula may be directly applied in order to ascertain the molecular
weight from the data; weight of vapour <i>m</i> grms., its volume <i>v</i> c.c., pressure <i>p</i> cm., and
temperature <i>t</i>°; for <i>s</i> = the weight of vapour <i>m</i>, divided by the volume <i>v</i>, and consequently
M = 6,200<i>m</i>(273 + <i>t</i>)/<i>pv</i>. Therefore, instead of the formula (<i>see</i> Chapter II.,
Note 34), <i>pv</i> = R(273 + <i>t</i>), where R varies with the mass and nature of a gas, we may
apply the formula <i>pv</i> = 6,200(<i>m</i>/M)(273 + <i>t</i>). These formulæ simplify the calculations
in many cases. For example, required the volume <i>v</i> occupied by 5 grms. of aqueous
vapour at a temperature <i>t</i> = 127° and under a pressure <i>p</i> = 76 cm. According to the
formula M = 6,200<i>m</i>(273 + <i>t</i>)/<i>pv</i>, we find that <i>v</i> = 9,064 c.c., as in the case of water
M = 18, <i>m</i> in this instance = 5 grms. (These formulæ, however, like the laws of gases,
are only approximate.)</p></div>

<p>If a horizontal glass tube (about 1 metre long and closed at both ends) be full of a
gas, and be firmly fixed at its middle point, then it is easy to bring the tube and gas into
a state of vibration, by rubbing it from centre to end with a damp cloth. The vibration of
the gas is easily rendered visible, if the interior of the tube be dusted with lycopodium
(the yellow powder-dust or spores of the lycopodium plant is often employed in medicine),
before the gas is introduced and the tube fused up. The fine lycopodium powder arranges
itself in patches, whose number depends on the velocity of sound in the gas. If there
be 10 patches, then the velocity of sound in the gas is ten times slower than in glass. It
is evident that this is an easy method of comparing the velocity of sound in gases. It
has been demonstrated by experiment that the velocity of sound in oxygen is four times
less than in hydrogen, and the square roots of the densities and molecular weights of

law when applied to the latent heat of evaporation, at all events it brings to light a
certain uniformity in figures, which otherwise only represent the simple result of observation.
Molecular quantities of liquids appear to expend almost equal amounts of heat
in their evaporation. It may be said that the latent heat of evaporation of molecular
quantities is approximately constant, because the <i>vis viva</i> of the motion of the molecules

applied like the cryoscopic method to dilute solutions for determining the molecular
weight of a substance in solution, are more difficult to carry out in practice, and only the
method of <i>determining the rise of the boiling point</i> of dilute solutions can from its
facility be placed parallel with the cryoscopic method, to which it bears a strong
resemblance, as in both the solvent changes its state and is partially separated. In the
boiling point method it passes off in the form of a vapour, while in cryoscopic determinations
it separates out in the form of a solid body.</p>

<p>Van't Hoff, starting from the second law of thermodynamics, showed that the
dependence of the rise of pressure (<i>dp</i>) upon a rise of temperature (<i>d</i>T) is determined by
the equation <i>dp</i> = (<i>kmp</i>/2T<sup>2</sup>)<i>d</i>T, where <i>k</i> is the latent heat of evaporation of the solvent,
<i>m</i> its molecular weight, <i>p</i> the tension of the saturated vapour of the solvent at T, and T
the absolute temperature (T = 273 + <i>t</i>), while Raoult found that the quantity (<i>p</i> - <i>p&#8242;</i>)/<i>p</i>
(Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_50_97">50</a>) or the measure of the relative fall of tension (<i>p</i> the tension of the
solvent or water, and <i>p&#8242;</i> of the solution) is found by the ratio of the number of molecules,
<i>n</i> of the substance dissolved, and N of the solvent, so that (<i>p</i> - <i>p&#8242;</i>)/<i>p</i> = C<i>n</i>/(N + <i>n</i>) where
C is a constant. With very dilute solutions <i>p</i> <i> - p&#8242;</i> may be taken as equal to <i>dp</i>, and the
fraction <i>n</i>/(N + <i>n</i>) as equal to <i>n</i>/N (because in that case the value of N is very much
greater than <i>n</i>), and then, judging from experiment, C is nearly unity&mdash;hence:
<i>dp/p</i> = <i>n</i>/N or <i>dp</i> = <i>np</i>/N, and on substituting this in the above equation we have
(<i>kmp</i>/2T<sup>2</sup>)<i>d</i>T = <i>np</i>/N. Taking a weight of the solvent <i>m</i>/N = 100, and of the substance
dissolved (per 100 of the solvent) <i>q</i>, where <i>q</i> evidently = <i>n</i>M, if M be the molecular
weight of the substance dissolved, we find that <i>n</i>/N = <i>qm</i>/100M, and hence, according to
the preceding equation, we have M =

that is, by taking a solution of <i>q</i>
grms. of a substance in 100 grms. of a solvent, and determining by experiment the rise
of the boiling point <i>d</i>T, we find the molecular weight M of the substance dissolved,
because the fraction 0·02T<sup>2</sup>/<i>k</i> is (for a given pressure and solvent) a constant; for water
at 100° (T = 373°) when <i>k</i> = 534 (Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_11_57">11</a>), it is nearly 5·2, for ether nearly 21,
for bisulphide of carbon nearly 24, for alcohol nearly 11·5, &amp;c. As an example, we will
cite from the determinations made by Professor Sakurai, of Japan (1893), that when
water was the solvent and the substance dissolved, corrosive sublimate, HgCl<sub>2</sub>, was taken
in the quantity <i>q</i> = 8·978 and 4·253 grms., the rise in the boiling point <i>d</i>T was = O°·179 and
0°·084, whence M = 261 and 263, and when alcohol was the solvent, <i>q</i> = 10·873 and 8·765
and <i>d</i>T = 0°·471 and 0°·380, whence M = 266 and 265, whilst the actual molecular weight of
corrosive sublimate = 271, which is very near to that given by this method. In the
same manner for aqueous solutions of sugar (M = 342), when <i>q</i> varied from 14 to 2·4, and
the rise of the boiling point from 0°·21 to 0°·035, M was found to vary between 339 and
364. For solutions of iodine I<sub>2</sub> in ether, the molecular weight was found by this method
to be between 255 and 262, and I<sub>2</sub> = 254. Sakurai obtained similar results (between 247
and 262) for solutions of iodine in bisulphide of carbon.</p>

<p>We will here remark that in determining M (the molecular weight of the substance
dissolved) at small but increasing concentrations (per 100 grms. of water), the results
obtained by Julio Baroni (1893) show that the value of M found by the formula may
either increase or decrease. An increase, for instance, takes place in aqueous solutions
of HgCl<sub>2</sub> (from 255 to 334 instead of 271), KNO<sub>3</sub> (57&ndash;66 instead of 101), AgNO<sub>3</sub> (104&ndash;107
instead of 170), K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (55&ndash;89 instead of 174), sugar (328&ndash;348 instead of 342), &amp;c. On the
contrary the calculated value of M decreases as the concentration increases, for solutions
of KCl (40&ndash;39 instead of 74·5), NaCl (33&ndash;28 instead of 58·5), NaBr (60&ndash;49 instead
of 103), &amp;c. In this case (as also for LiCl, NaI, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>NaO<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.) the value of <i>i</i> (Chapter
I., Note <a href="#Footnote_49_96">49</a>), or the ratio between the actual molecular weight and that found by the
rise of the boiling point, was found to increase with the concentration, <i>i.e.</i> to be greater
than 1, and to differ more and more from unity as the strength of the solution becomes
greater. For example, according to Schlamp (1894), for LiCl, with a variation of from
1·1 to 6·7 grm. LiCl per 100 of water, <i>i</i> varies from 1·63 to 1·89. But for substances
of the first series (HgCl<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.), although in very dilute solutions <i>i</i> is greater than 1,
it approximates to 1 as the concentration increases, and this is the normal phenomenon
for solutions which do not conduct an electric current, as, for instance, of sugar. And
with certain electrolytes, such as HgCl<sub>2</sub>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c., <i>i</i> exhibits a similar variation;
thus, for HgCl<sub>2</sub> the value of M is found to vary between 255 and 334; that is, <i>i</i> (as
the molecular weight = 271) varies between 1·06 and 0·81. Hence I do not believe that
the difference between <i>i</i> and unity (for instance, for CaCl<sub>2</sub>, <i>i</i> is about 3, for KI about 2,
and decreases with the concentration) can at present be placed at the basis of any
general chemical conclusions, and it requires further experimental research. Among
other methods by which the value of <i>i</i> is now determined for dilute solutions is the
study of their electroconductivity, admitting that <i>i</i> = 1 + <i>a</i>(<i>k</i> - 1), where <i>a</i> = the ratio
of the molecular conductivity to the limiting conductivity corresponding to an infinitely
large dilution (<i>see</i> Physical Chemistry), and <i>k</i> is the number of ions into which the
substance dissolved can split up. Without entering upon a criticism of this method
of determining <i>i</i>, I will only remark that it frequently gives values of <i>i</i> very close to
those found by the depression of the freezing point and rise of the boiling point; but
that this accordance of results is sometimes very doubtful. Thus for a solution containing
5·67 grms. CaCl<sub>2</sub> per 100 grms. of water, <i>i</i>, according to the vapour tension = 2·52,
according to the boiling point = 2·71, according to the electroconductivity = 2·28, while
for solutions in propyl alcohol (Schlamp 1894) <i>i</i> is near to 1·33. In a word, although
these methods of determining the molecular weight of substances in solution show an
undoubted progress in the general chemical principles of the molecular theory, there are
still many points which require explanation.</p>

<p>We will add certain general relations which apply to these problems. Isotonic
(Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>) solutions exhibit not only similar osmotic pressures, but also the
same vapour tension, boiling point and freezing temperature. The osmotic pressure
bears the same relation to the fall of the vapour tension as the specific gravity of a
solution does to the specific gravity of the vapour of the solvent. The general formulæ
underlying the whole doctrine of the influence of the molecular weight upon the
properties of solutions considered above, are: 1. Raoult in 1886&ndash;1890 showed that

amount in grms. of the substance dissolved per 100 grms. of solvent, M and <i>m</i> the
molecular weights of the substance dissolved and solvent. 2. Raoult and Recoura in
1890 showed that the constant above C = the ratio of the actual vapour density <i>d</i>&#8242; of
the solvent to the theoretical density <i>d</i> calculated according to the molecular weight.
This deduction may now be considered proved, because both the fall of tension and the
ratio of the vapour densities <i>d</i>&#8242;/<i>d</i> give, for water 1·03, for alcohol 1·02, for ether 1·04, for
bisulphide of carbon 1·00, for benzene 1·02, for acetic acid 1·63. 3. By applying the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_438" id="Footnote_28_438"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_438"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> A similar conclusion respecting the molecular weight of liquid water (<i>i.e.</i> that its
molecule in a liquid state is more complex than in a gaseous state, or polymerized into
H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or in general into <i>n</i>H<sub>2</sub>O) is frequently met in chemico-physical literature,
but as yet there is no basis for its being fully admitted, although it is possible that
a polymerization or aggregation of several molecules into one takes place in the passage
of water into a liquid or solid state, and that there is a converse depolymerization
in the act of evaporation. Recently, particular attention has been drawn to this subject
owing to the researches of Eötvös (1886) and Ramsay and Shields (1893) on the variation
of the surface tension N with the temperature (N = the capillary constant <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> multiplied
by the specific gravity and divided by 2, for example, for water at 0° and 100° the value
of <i>a</i><sup>2</sup> = 15·41 and 12·58 sq. mm., and the surface tension 7·92 and 6·04). Starting from
the absolute boiling point (Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_29_153">29</a>) and adding 6°, as was necessary
from all the data obtained, and calling this temperature T, it is found that
AS = <i>k</i>T, where S is the surface of a gram-molecule of the liquid (if M is its weight
in grams, <i>s</i> its sp. gr., then its sp. volume = M/<i>s</i>, and the surface S = &#8731;(M/<i>s</i>)<sup>2</sup>), A the
surface tension (determined by experiment at T), and <i>k</i> a constant which is independent
of the composition of the molecule. The equation AS = <i>k</i>T is in complete
agreement with the well-known equation for gases <i>vp</i> = RT (p. <a href="#Page_140">140</a>) which serves for
deducing the molecular weight from the vapour density. Ramsay's researches led him
to the conclusion that the liquid molecules of CS<sub>2</sub>, ether, benzene, and of many other
substances, have the same value as in a state of vapour, whilst with other liquids this is
not the case, and that to obtain an accordance, that is, that <i>k</i> shall be a constant, it is
necessary to assume the molecular weight in the liquid state to be <i>n</i> times as great.
For the fatty alcohols and acids <i>n</i> varies from 1&frac12; to 3&frac12;, for water from 2&frac14; to 4, according
to the temperature (at which the depolymerization takes place). Hence, although this
subject offers a great theoretical interest, it cannot be regarded as firmly established,
the more so since the fundamental observations are difficult to make and not sufficiently
numerous; should, however, further experiments confirm the conclusions arrived at by
Professor Ramsay, this will give another method of determining molecular weights.</p></div>

(Chapter I., Notes <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a> and <a href="#Footnote_49_96">49</a>) by the quantity <i>i</i>, taking it as = 1 when <i>k</i> = 1·05, in that case
for KI, <i>i</i> is nearly 2, for borax about 4, &amp;c.</p></div>

a substance on the molecular weight. If one molecular part by weight of the various
chlorides&mdash;for instance, of sodium, calcium, barium, &amp;c.&mdash;be dissolved in 200 molecular
parts by weight of water (for instance, in 3,600 grams) then it is found that the greater
the molecular weight of the salt dissolved, the greater is the specific gravity of the
resultant solution.</p>

observed that the coefficient of refraction is determined by two methods: (<i>a</i>) either all
the data are referred to one definite ray&mdash;for instance, to the Fraunhofer (sodium) line

ray (of the hydrogen spectrum) whose wave length is 656 millionths of a millimetre; (<i>b</i>)
or Cauchy's formula is used, showing the relation between the coefficient of refraction and

<span class="fdn">&#955;</span>

where A and B are two constants varying
for every substance but constant for all rays of the spectrum, and &#955; is the wave length
of that ray whose coefficient of refraction is <i>n</i>. In the latter method the investigation
usually concerns the magnitudes of A, which are independent of dispersion. We shall
afterwards cite the data, investigated by the first method, by which Gladstone, Landolt,
and others established the conception of the refraction equivalent.</p>

<p>It has long been known that the <i>coefficient of refraction n</i> for a given substance
decreases with the density of a substance D, so that the magnitude (<i>n</i> - 1) ÷ D = C is
almost constant for a given ray (having a definite wave length) and for a given substance.
This constant is called the <i>refractive energy</i>, and its product with the atomic or molecular
weight of a substance the <i>refraction equivalent</i>. The coefficient of refraction of
oxygen is 1·00021, of hydrogen 1·00014, their densities (referred to water) are 0·00143
and 0·00009, and their atomic weights, O = 16, H = 1; hence their refraction equivalents
are 3 and 1·5. Water contains H<sub>2</sub>O, consequently the sum of the equivalents of
refraction is (2 × 1·5) + 3 = 6. But as the coefficient of refraction of water = 1·331,
its refraction equivalent = 5·958, or nearly 6. Comparison shows that, approximately,
the sum of the refraction equivalents of the atoms forming compounds
(or mixtures) is equal to the refraction equivalent of the compound. According to the
researches of Gladstone, Landolt, Hagen, Brühl and others, the refraction equivalents of
the elements are&mdash;H = 1·3, Li = 3·8, B = 4·0, C = 5·0, N = 4·1 (in its highest state of oxidation,
5·3), O = 2·9, F = 1·4, Na = 4·8, Mg = 7·0, Al = 8·4, Si = 6·8, P = 18·3, S = 16·0, Cl = 9·9,
K = 8·1, Ca = 10·4, Mn = 12·2, Fe = 12·0 (in the salts of its higher oxides, 20·1), Co = 10·8,
Cu = 11·6, Zn = 10·2, As = 15·4, Bi = 15·3, Ag = 15·7, Cd = 13·6, I = 24·5, Pt = 26·0, Hg = 20·2,
Pb = 24·8, &amp;c. The refraction equivalents of many elements could only be calculated
from the solutions of their compounds. The composition of a solution being known it is
possible to calculate the refraction equivalent of one of its component parts, those for all
its other components being known. The results are founded on the acceptance of a law
which cannot be strictly applied. Nevertheless the representation of the refraction
equivalents gives an easy means for directly, although only approximately, obtaining the
coefficient of refraction from the chemical composition of a substance. For instance,
the composition of carbon bisulphide is CS<sub>2</sub> = 76, and from its density, 1·27, we find its
coefficient of refraction to be 1·618 (because the refraction equivalent = 5 + 2 × 16 = 37),
which is very near the actual figure. It is evident that in the above representation compounds
are looked on as simple mixtures of atoms, and the physical properties of a compound
as the sum of the properties present in the elementary atoms forming it. If this
representation of the presence of simple atoms in compounds had not existed, the idea
of combining by a few figures a whole mass of data relating to the coefficient of refraction
of different substances could hardly have arisen. For further details on this subject,
see works on <i>Physical Chemistry</i>.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">CARBON AND THE HYDROCARBONS</span></h2>

<p>It is necessary to clearly distinguish between the two closely-allied
terms, charcoal and carbon. Charcoal is well known to everybody,
although it is no easy matter to obtain it in a chemically pure state.
Pure charcoal is a simple, insoluble, infusible, combustible substance
produced by heating organic matter, and has the familiar aspect of a
black mass, devoid of any crystalline structure, and completely insoluble.
Charcoal is a substance possessing a peculiar combination of
physical and chemical properties. This substance, whilst in a state of
ignition, combines directly with oxygen; in organic substances it is
found in combination with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur.
But in all these combinations there is no real charcoal, as in the same
sense there is no ice in steam. What is found in such combinations is
termed &lsquo;carbon&rsquo;&mdash;that is, an element common to charcoal, to those
substances which can be formed from it, and also to those substances
from which it can be obtained. Carbon may take the form of charcoal,
but occurs also as diamond and as graphite. Truly no other
element has such a wide terminology. Oxygen is always called
&lsquo;oxygen,&rsquo; whether it is in a free gaseous state, or in the form of
ozone, or oxygen in water, or in nitric acid or in carbonic anhydride.
But here there is some confusion. In water it is evident that there is
no oxygen in a gaseous form, such as can be obtained in a free state,
no oxygen in the form of ozone, but a substance which is capable
of producing both oxygen, ozone, and water. As an element, oxygen
possesses a known chemical individuality, and an influence on the
properties of those combinations into which it enters. Hydrogen gas
is a substance which reacts with difficulty, but the element hydrogen
represents in its combinations an easily displaceable component part.
Carbon may be considered as an atom of carbon matter, and charcoal
as a collection of such atoms forming a whole substance, or mass of
molecules of the substance. The accepted atomic weight of carbon
is 12, because that is the least quantity of carbon which enters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
into combination in molecules of its compounds; but the weight of
the molecules of charcoal is probably very much greater. This weight
remains unknown because charcoal is capable of but few direct
reactions and those only at a high temperature (when the weight
of its molecules probably changes, as when ozone changes into oxygen),
and it does not turn into vapour. Carbon exists in nature, both in
a free and combined state, in most varied forms and aspects. Carbon
in a free state is found in at least three different forms, as charcoal,
graphite, and the diamond. In a combined state it enters into the
composition of what are called organic substances&mdash;a multitude of
substances which are found in all plants and animals. It exists
as carbonic anhydride both in air and in water, and in the soil
and crust of the earth as salts of carbonic acid and as organic
remains.</p>

<p>The variety of the substances of which the structure of plants and
animals is built up is familiar to all. Wax, oil, turpentine, and tar,
cotton and albumin, the tissue of plants and the muscular fibre of
animals, vinegar and starch, are all vegetable and animal matters, and
all carbon compounds.<a name="FNanchor_1_442" id="FNanchor_1_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_442" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The class of carbon compounds is so vast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
that it forms a separate branch of chemistry, known under the name
of organic chemistry&mdash;that is, the chemistry of carbon compounds, or,
more strictly, of the hydrocarbons and their derivatives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span></p>

<p>If any one of these organic compounds be strongly heated without free
access of air&mdash;or, better still, in a vacuum&mdash;it decomposes with more or
less facility. If the supply of air be insufficient, or the temperature be
too low for combustion (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>.), and if the first volatile products
of transformation of the organic matter are subjected to condensation
(for example, if the door of a stove be opened), an imperfect
combustion takes place, and smoke, with charcoal or soot, is formed.<a name="FNanchor_2_443" id="FNanchor_2_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_443" class="fnanchor">[2]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
The nature of the phenomenon, and the products arising from it, are the
same as those produced by heating alone, since that part which is in a
state of combustion serves to heat the remainder of the fuel. The
decomposition which takes place on heating a compound composed of
carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen is as follows:&mdash;A part of the hydrogen
is separated in a gaseous state, another part in combination with
oxygen, and a third part separates in combination with carbon, and
sometimes in combination with carbon and oxygen in the form of
gaseous or volatile products, or, as they are also called, the products of
dry distillation. If the vapours of these products are passed through
a strongly heated tube, they are changed again in a similar manner
and finally resolve themselves into hydrogen and charcoal. Altogether
these various products of decomposition contain a smaller amount of
carbon than the original organic matter; part of the carbon remains
in a free state, forming charcoal.<a name="FNanchor_3_444" id="FNanchor_3_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_444" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It remains in that space where
the decomposition took place, in the shape of the black, infusible,
non-volatile charcoal familiar to all. The earthy matter and all non-volatile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
substances (ash) forming a part of the organic matter, remain
behind with the charcoal. The tar-like substances, which require a
high temperature in order to decompose them, also remain mixed with
charcoal. If a volatile organic substance, such as a gaseous compound
containing oxygen and hydrogen, be taken, the carbon separates on
passing the vapour through a tube heated to a high temperature.
Organic substances when burning with an insufficient supply of air
give off soot&mdash;that is, charcoal&mdash;proceeding from carbon compounds in
a state of vapour, the hydrogen of which has, by combustion, been
converted into water; so, for instance, turpentine, naphthalene, and
other hydrocarbons which are with difficulty decomposed by heat, easily
yield carbon in the form of soot during combustion. Chlorine and
other substances which, like oxygen, are capable of taking up hydrogen,
and also substances which are capable of taking up water, can
also separate carbon from (or char) most organic substances.</p>

<p>Wood charcoal is prepared in large quantities in a similar manner&mdash;that
is, by the partial combustion of wood.<a name="FNanchor_4_445" id="FNanchor_4_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_445" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In nature a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
process of carbonisation of vegetable refuse takes place in its transformation
under water, as shown by the marshy vegetation which
forms peat.<a name="FNanchor_5_446" id="FNanchor_5_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_446" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> In this manner doubtless the enormous masses of
coal were formed<a name="FNanchor_6_447" id="FNanchor_6_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_447" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> which, following the example set by England, are
now utilised everywhere as the principal material for heating steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a><br /><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
boilers, and in general for all purposes of heating and burning.<a name="FNanchor_7_448" id="FNanchor_7_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_448" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Russia possesses many very rich coalfields, amongst which the Donetz
district is most worthy of remark.<a name="FNanchor_8_449" id="FNanchor_8_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_449" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>During the imperfect combustion of volatile substances containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
carbon and hydrogen, the hydrogen and part of the carbon first burn,
and the remainder of the carbon forms soot. Tar, pitch, and similar
substances for this reason burn with a smoky flame. Thus soot is
finely-divided charcoal separated during the imperfect combustion of
the vapours and gases of carbonaceous substances rich in carbon.
Specially-prepared soot (lampblack) is very largely used as a black
paint and a large quantity goes for the manufacture of printers' ink.
It is prepared by burning tar, oil, natural gas, naphtha, &amp;c. The
quantity of organic matter remaining undecomposed in the charcoal
depends on the temperature to which it has been submitted. Charcoal
prepared at the lowest temperature still contains a considerable
quantity of hydrogen and oxygen&mdash;even as much as 4 p.c. of hydrogen
and 20 p.c. of oxygen. Such charcoal still preserves the structure of
the substance from which it was obtained. Ordinary charcoal, for
instance, in which the structure of the tree is still visible, is of this
kind. On submitting it to further heating, a fresh quantity of
hydrogen with carbon and oxygen (in the form of gases or volatile
matter) may be separated, and the purest charcoal will be obtained on
submitting it to the greatest heat.<a name="FNanchor_9_450" id="FNanchor_9_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_450" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> If it be required to prepare pure
charcoal from soot it is necessary first to wash it with alcohol and
ether in order to remove the soluble tarry products, and then submit
it to a powerful heat to drive off the impurities containing hydrogen
and oxygen. Charcoal however when completely purified does not
change in appearance. Its porosity,<a name="FNanchor_10_451" id="FNanchor_10_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_451" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> bad conducting power for heat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
capability of absorbing the luminous rays (hence its blackness and
opacity), and many other qualities, are familiar from everyday experience.<a name="FNanchor_11_452" id="FNanchor_11_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_452" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The specific gravity of charcoal varies from 1·4 to 1·9, and
that it floats on water is due to the air contained in its pores. If
charcoal is reduced to a powder and moistened with spirit, it immediately
sinks in water. It is <i>infusible</i> in the furnace and even at the
temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame. In the heat generated by
means of a powerful galvanic current charcoal only softens but does not
completely melt, and on cooling it is found to have undergone a complete
change both in properties and appearance, and is more or less
transformed into graphite. The physical stability of charcoal is
without doubt allied to its chemical stability. It is evidently a
substance devoid of energy, for it is insoluble in all known liquids,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and <i>at an ordinary temperature does not combine with anything</i>; it
is an inactive substance, like nitrogen.<a name="FNanchor_12_453" id="FNanchor_12_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_453" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But these properties of
charcoal change with a rise of temperature; thus, unlike nitrogen,
charcoal, at a high temperature, combines directly with oxygen.
This is well known, as charcoal burns in air. Indeed, not only does
oxygen <i>combine with charcoal at a red heat</i>, but sulphur, hydrogen,
silicon, and also iron and some other metals<a name="FNanchor_12_BIS_454" id="FNanchor_12_BIS_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_BIS_454" class="fnanchor">[12 bis]</a> do so at a very
high temperature&mdash;that is, when the molecules of the charcoal have
reached a state of great instability&mdash;whilst at ordinary temperatures
neither oxygen, sulphur, nor metals act on charcoal in any way.
When burning in oxygen, charcoal forms carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>,
whilst in the vapours of sulphur, carbon bisulphide, CS<sub>2</sub>, is formed,
and wrought iron, when acted on by carbon, becomes cast iron.
At the great heat obtained by passing the galvanic current through
carbon electrodes, charcoal combines with hydrogen, forming acetylene,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>. Charcoal does not combine directly with nitrogen, but in the
presence of metals and alkaline oxides, nitrogen is absorbed, forming
a metallic cyanide, as, for instance, potassium cyanide, KCN.
From these few direct combinations which charcoal is capable of
entering into, may be derived those numerous carbonaceous compounds
which enter into the composition of plants and animals, and can be thus
obtained artificially. Certain substances containing oxygen give up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
part of it to charcoal at a relatively low temperature. For instance,
nitric acid when boiled with charcoal gives carbonic anhydride and
nitric peroxide. Sulphuric acid is reduced to sulphurous anhydride
when heated with carbon. When heated to redness charcoal absorbs
oxygen from a large number of the oxides. Even such oxides
as those of sodium and potassium, when heated to redness, yield their
oxygen to charcoal although they do not part with it to hydrogen.
Only a few of the oxides, like silica (oxide of silicon) and lime (calcium
oxide) resist the reducing action of charcoal. Charcoal is capable of
changing its physical condition without undergoing any alteration in
its essential chemical properties&mdash;that is, it passes into <i>isomeric</i> or <i>allotropic
forms</i>. The two other particular forms in which carbon appears
are the <i>diamond</i> and <i>graphite</i>. The identity of composition of these with
charcoal is proved by burning an equal quantity of all three separately
in oxygen (at a very high temperature), when each gives the same
quantity of carbonic anhydride&mdash;namely, 12 parts of charcoal, diamond,
or graphite in a pure state, yield on burning 44 parts by weight of
carbonic anhydride. The physical properties present a marked contrast;
the densest sorts of charcoal have a density of only 1·9, whilst
the density of graphite is about 2·3, and that of the diamond 3·5. A
great many other properties depend on the density, for instance combustibility.
The lighter charcoal is, the more easily it burns; graphite
burns with considerable difficulty even in oxygen, and the diamond
burns only in oxygen and at a very high temperature. On burning,
charcoal, the diamond, and graphite develop different quantities of heat.
One part by weight of wood charcoal converted by burning into
carbonic anhydride develops 8,080 heat units; dense charcoal separated
in gas retorts develops 8,050 heat units; natural graphite, 7,800 heat
units; and the diamond 7,770. The greater the density the less the
heat evolved by the combustion of the carbon.<a name="FNanchor_13_455" id="FNanchor_13_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_455" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>By means of intense heat charcoal may be transformed into
graphite. If a charcoal rod 4 mm. in diameter and 5 mm. long be enclosed
in an exhausted receiver and the current from 600 Bunsen's elements,
placed in parallel series of 100, be passed through it, the charcoal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
becomes strongly incandescent, partially volatilises, and is deposited in
the form of graphite. If sugar be placed in a charcoal crucible and
a powerful galvanic current passed through it, it is baked into a mass
similar to graphite. If charcoal be mixed with wrought iron and
heated, cast iron is formed, which contains as much as five per cent. of
charcoal. If molten cast iron be suddenly chilled, the carbon remains
in combination with the iron, forming so called white cast iron; but if
the cooling proceeds slowly, the greater part of the carbon separates
in the form of graphite, and if such cast iron (so called grey cast
iron) be dissolved in acid, the carbon remains in the form of graphite.
Graphite is met with in nature, sometimes in the form of large compact
masses, sometimes permeating rocky formations like the schists
or slates, and in fact is met with in those places which, in all probability,
have been subjected to the action of subterranean heat.<a name="FNanchor_14_456" id="FNanchor_14_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_456" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The
graphite in cast iron, and sometimes also natural graphite, occasionally
appears in a crystalline form in the shape of six-sided plates, but more
often it occurs as a compact amorphous mass having the characteristic
properties of the familiar black-lead pencil.<a name="FNanchor_15_457" id="FNanchor_15_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_457" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>The diamond is a crystalline and transparent form of carbon. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of rare occurrence in nature, and is found in the alluvial deposits of
the diamond mines of Brazil, India, South Africa, &amp;c. It has also been
found in meteorites.<a name="FNanchor_15_BIS_458" id="FNanchor_15_BIS_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_BIS_458" class="fnanchor">[15 bis]</a> It crystallises in octahedra, dodecahedra,
cubes, and other forms of the regular system.<a name="FNanchor_16_459" id="FNanchor_16_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_459" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The efforts which have
been made to produce diamonds artificially, although they have not been
fruitless, have not as yet led to the production of large-sized crystals,
because those means by which crystals are generally formed are inapplicable
to carbon. Indeed, carbon in all its forms being insoluble
and infusible does not pass into a liquid condition by means of which
crystallisation could take place. Diamonds have several times been
successfully produced in the shape of minute crystals having the
appearance of a black powder, but when viewed under the microscope
appearing transparent, and possessing that hardness which is the
peculiar characteristic of the diamond. This diamond powder is deposited
on the negative electrode, when a weak galvanic current is
passed through liquid chloride of carbon.<a name="FNanchor_16_BIS_460" id="FNanchor_16_BIS_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_BIS_460" class="fnanchor">[16 bis]</a></p>

<p>Moissan (Paris, 1893) produced diamonds artificially by means of
the high temperature attained in the electrical furnace<a name="FNanchor_17_461" id="FNanchor_17_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_461" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> by dissolving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
carbon in molten cast iron, and allowing the solution with an
excess of carbon, to cool under the powerful pressure exerted by
rapidly cooling the metal.<a name="FNanchor_17_BIS_462" id="FNanchor_17_BIS_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_BIS_462" class="fnanchor">[17 bis]</a> K. Chroustchoff attained the same end
by means of silver, which dissolves carbon to the extent of 6 p.c.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
at a high temperature. Rousseau, for the same purpose, heated
carbide of calcium in the electric furnace. There is no doubt that
all these investigators obtained the diamond as a transparent body,
which burnt into CO<sub>2</sub>, and possessed an exceptional hardness, but only
in the form of a fine powder.</p>

<p>Judging from the fact that carbon forms a number of gaseous bodies
(carbonic oxide, carbonic anhydride, methane, ethylene, acetylene, &amp;c.)
and volatile substances (for example, many hydrocarbons and their
most simple derivatives), and considering that the atomic weight of
carbon, C = 12, approaches that of nitrogen, N = 14, and that of oxygen,
O = 16, and that the compounds CO (carbonic oxide) and N<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (cyanogen)
are gases, it may be argued that if carbon formed the molecule C<sub>2</sub>, like
N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>, it would be a gas. And as through polymerism or the combination
of like molecules (as O<sub>2</sub> passes into O<sub>3</sub> or NO<sub>2</sub> into N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) the
temperatures of ebullition and fusion rise (which is particularly clearly
proved with the hydrocarbons of the C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub> series), it ought to be considered
that <i>the molecules of charcoal, graphite, and the diamond are
very complex</i>, seeing that they are insoluble, non-volatile, and infusible.
The aptitude which the atoms of carbon show for combining together
and forming complex molecules appears in all carbon compounds.
Among the volatile compounds of carbon many are well known the
molecules of which contain C<sub>5</sub> ... C<sub>10</sub> ... C<sub>20</sub> ... C<sub>30</sub>, &amp;c., in
general C<sub>n</sub> where n may be very large, and in none of the other elements
is this faculty of complexity so developed as in carbon.<a name="FNanchor_18_463" id="FNanchor_18_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_463" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Up
to the present time there are no grounds for determining the degree
of polymerism of the charcoal, graphite, or diamond molecules, and it
can only be supposed that they contain C<sub>n</sub> where n is a large quantity.
Charcoal and those complex non-volatile organic substances which
represent the gradual transitions to charcoal<a name="FNanchor_19_464" id="FNanchor_19_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_464" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and form the principal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
solid substances of organisms, contain a store or accumulation of
internal power in the form of the energy binding the atoms into complex
molecules. When charcoal or complex compounds of carbon burn, the
energy of the carbon and oxygen is turned into heat, and this fact is
taken advantage of at every turn for the generation of heat from fuel.<a name="FNanchor_20_465" id="FNanchor_20_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_465" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>No other two elements are capable of combining together in
such variety as carbon and hydrogen. The hydrocarbons of the
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>m</i></sub> series in many cases differ widely from each other, although
they have some properties in common. All hydrocarbons, whether
gaseous, liquid or solid, are combustible substances sparingly soluble or
insoluble in water. The liquefied gaseous hydrocarbons, as well as those
which are liquid at ordinary temperatures, and those solid hydrocarbons
which have been liquefied by fusion, have the appearance and property
of oily liquors, more or less viscid, or fluid.<a name="FNanchor_21_466" id="FNanchor_21_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_466" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The solid hydrocarbons
more or less resemble wax in their properties, although ordinary oils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and wax generally contain oxygen in addition to carbon and hydrogen,
but in relatively small proportion. There are also many hydrocarbons
which have the appearance of tar&mdash;as, for instance, metacinnamene and
gutta-percha. Those liquid hydrocarbons which boil at a high temperature
are like oils, and those which have a low boiling point resemble
ether, whilst the gaseous hydrocarbons in many of their properties are
akin to hydrogen. All this tends to show that in hydrocarbons physically
considered the properties of solid non-volatile charcoal are
strongly modified and hidden, whilst those of the hydrogen predominate.
All hydrocarbons are neutral substances (neither basic nor acid), but
under certain conditions they enter into peculiar reactions. It has
been seen in those hydrogen compounds which have been already considered
(water, nitric acid, ammonia) that the hydrogen in almost all
cases enters into reaction, being displaced by metals. The hydrogen of
the hydrocarbons, it may be said, has no metallic character that is to
say, it is not directly<a name="FNanchor_22_467" id="FNanchor_22_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_467" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> displaced by metals, even by such as sodium and
potassium. On the application of more or less heat all hydrocarbons
decompose<a name="FNanchor_23_468" id="FNanchor_23_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_468" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> forming charcoal and hydrogen. The majority of hydrocarbons
do not combine with the oxygen of the air or oxidise at ordinary
temperatures, but under the action of nitric acid and many other
oxidising substances most of them undergo oxidation, in which either
a portion of the hydrogen and carbon is separated, or the oxygen
enters into combination, or else the elements of hydrogen peroxide enter
into combination with the hydrocarbon.<a name="FNanchor_24_469" id="FNanchor_24_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_469" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> When heated in air, hydrocarbons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
burn, and, according to the amount of carbon they contain,
their combustion is attended more or less with a separation of soot&mdash;that
is, finely divided charcoal&mdash;which imparts great brilliancy to the
flame, and on this account many of them are used for the purposes of
illumination&mdash;as, for instance, kerosene, coal gas, oil of turpentine.
As hydrocarbons contain reducing elements (that is, those capable of
combining with oxygen), they often act as reducing agents&mdash;as, for
instance, when heated with oxide of copper, they burn, forming carbonic
anhydride and water, and leave metallic copper. Gerhardt proved
that all hydrocarbons contain an even number of hydrogen atoms.
Therefore, the general formula for all hydrocarbons is C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>m</i></sub> where
<i>n</i> and <i>m</i> are whole numbers. This fact is known as <i>the law of even
numbers</i>. Hence, the simplest possible hydrocarbons ought to be:
CH<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>6</sub> ... C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>8</sub> ... but they do not
all exist, since the quantity of H which can combine with a certain
amount of carbon is limited, as we shall learn directly.</p>

<p>Some of the hydrocarbons are capable of combination, whilst others
do not show that power. Those which contain less hydrogen belong to
the former category, and those which, for a given quantity of carbon,
contain the maximum amount of hydrogen, belong to the latter. The
composition of those last mentioned is expressed by the general formula
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i> + 2</sub>. These so-called <i>saturated hydrocarbons</i> are incapable of
combination.<a name="FNanchor_25_470" id="FNanchor_25_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_470" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> The hydrocarbons CH<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, &amp;c.... do not
exist. Those containing the maximum amount of hydrogen will be
represented by CH<sub>4</sub> (<i>n</i> = 1, 2<i>n</i> + 2 = 4), C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> (<i>n</i> = 2), C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> (n = 3),
C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, &amp;c. This may be termed the <i>law of limits</i>. Placing this in
juxtaposition with the law of even numbers, it is easy to perceive that
the possible hydrocarbons can be ranged in series, the terms of which
may be expressed by the general formulæ C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>-2</sub>,
&amp;c.... Those hydrocarbons which belong to any one of the series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
expressible by a general formula are said to be <i>homologous</i>0 with one
another. Thus, the hydrocarbons CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, &amp;c....
are members of the limiting (saturated) homologous series C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>.
That is, the difference between the members of the series is CH<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_26_471" id="FNanchor_26_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_471" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
Not only the composition but also the properties of the members of
a series tend to classification in one group. For instance, the members
of the series C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub> are not capable of forming additive compounds,
whilst those of the series C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub> are capable of combining with chlorine,
sulphuric anhydride, &amp;c.; and the members of the C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>-6</sub> group,
belonging to the coal tar series, are easily nitrated (give nitro-compounds,
Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>.), and have other properties in common. The physical
properties of the members of a given homologous series vary in some
such manner as this; the boiling point generally rises and the internal
friction increases as <i>n</i> increases<a name="FNanchor_27_472" id="FNanchor_27_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_472" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>&mdash;that is, with an increase in the
relative amount of carbon and the atomic weight; the specific gravity
also regularly changes as <i>n</i> becomes greater.<a name="FNanchor_28_473" id="FNanchor_28_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_473" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Many of the hydrocarbons met with in nature are the products of
organisms, and do not belong to the mineral kingdom. A still greater
number are produced artificially. These are formed by what is termed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
the combination of residues. For instance, if a mixture of the vapours
of hydrogen sulphide and carbon bisulphide be passed through a tube
in which copper is heated, this latter absorbs the sulphur from both
the compounds, and the liberated carbon and hydrogen combine to
form a hydrocarbon, methane. If carbon be combined with any metal
and this compound MC<sub><i>n</i></sub> be treated with an acid HX, then the
haloid X will give a salt with the metal and the residual carbon and
hydrogen will give a hydrocarbon. Thus cast iron which contains a
compound of iron and carbon gives liquid hydrocarbons like naphtha
under the action of acids. If a mixture of bromo-benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Br,
and ethyl bromide, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Br, be heated with metallic sodium, the
sodium combines with the bromine of both compounds, forming sodium
bromide, NaBr. From the first combination the group C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub> remains,
and from the second C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>. Having an odd number of hydrogen atoms,
they, in virtue of the law of even numbers, cannot exist alone, and therefore
combine together forming the compound C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>.C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> or C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>
(ethylbenzene). Hydrocarbons are also produced by the breaking up
of more complex organic or hydrocarbon compounds, especially by heating&mdash;that
is, by dry distillation. For instance, gum-benzoin contains
an acid called benzoic acid, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the vapours of which, when passed
through a heated tube, split up into carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, and
benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. Carbon and hydrogen only unite directly in one ratio
of combination&mdash;namely, to form acetylene, having the composition
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, which, as compared with other hydrocarbons, exhibits a very
great stability at a somewhat high temperature.<a name="FNanchor_29_474" id="FNanchor_29_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_474" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>There is one substance known among the saturated hydrocarbons
composed of 1 atom of carbon and 4 atoms of hydrogen; this is a compound
containing the highest percentage of hydrogen (CH<sub>4</sub> contains
25 per cent. of hydrogen), and at the same time it is the only hydrocarbon
whose molecule contains but a single atom of carbon. This
saturated hydrocarbon, CH<sub>4</sub>, is called <i>marsh gas</i> or <i>methane</i>. If
vegetable or animal refuse suffers decomposition in a space where the
air has not free access, or no access at all, then the decomposition is
accompanied with the formation of marsh gas, and this either at the
ordinary temperature, or at a comparatively much higher one. On this
account <i>plants</i>, when decomposing under water in <i>marshes</i>, give out
this gas.<a name="FNanchor_29_BIS_475" id="FNanchor_29_BIS_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_BIS_475" class="fnanchor">[29 bis]</a> It is well known that if the mud in bogs be stirred
up, the act is accompanied with the evolution of a large quantity of
gas bubbles; these may, although slowly, also separate of their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
accord. The gas which is evolved consists principally of marsh gas.<a name="FNanchor_30_476" id="FNanchor_30_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_476" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
If wood, coal, or many other vegetable or animal substances are decomposed
by the <i>action of heat</i> without access of air&mdash;that is, are subjected
to dry distillation&mdash;they, in addition to many other gaseous products
of decomposition (carbonic anhydride, hydrogen, and various other
substances), evolve a great deal of methane. Generally the gas which
is used for lighting purposes is obtained by this means and therefore
always contains marsh gas, mixed with dry hydrogen and other vapours
and gases, although it is subsequently purified from many of them.<a name="FNanchor_31_477" id="FNanchor_31_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_477" class="fnanchor">[31]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a><br /><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a><br /><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
As the decomposition of the organic matter, which forms coal, is still
going on underground, the evolution of large quantities of marsh gas
frequently occurs in coal-mines.<a name="FNanchor_32_478" id="FNanchor_32_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_478" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> When mixed with air it forms an
explosive mixture, which forms one of the great dangers of coal mining,
as subterranean work has always to be carried on by lamp-light. This
danger is, however, overcome by the use of Humphry Davy's safety
lamp.<a name="FNanchor_33_479" id="FNanchor_33_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_479" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Sir Humphry Davy observed that on introducing a piece of wire
gauze into a flame, it absorbs so much heat that combustion does not
proceed beyond it (the unburnt gases which pass through it may be
ignited on the other side). In accordance with this, the flame of the
Davy lamp is surrounded with a thick glass (as shown in the drawing),
and has no communication whatever with the explosive mixture except
through a wire gauze which prevents it igniting the mixture of the
marsh-gas issuing from the coal with air. In some districts, particularly
in those where petroleum is found&mdash;as, for instance, near Baku, where
a temple of the Indian fire-worshippers was built, and in Pennsylvania,
and other places&mdash;marsh gas in abundance issues from the earth, and
it is used, like coal gas, for the purposes of lighting and warming.<a name="FNanchor_34_480" id="FNanchor_34_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_480" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Tolerably pure marsh gas<a name="FNanchor_35_481" id="FNanchor_35_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_481" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> may be obtained by heating a mixture of an
acetate with an alkali. Acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, on being heated is decomposed
into marsh gas and carbonic anhydride, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = CH<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>An alkali&mdash;for instance, NaHO&mdash;gives with acetic acid a salt,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>NaO<sub>2</sub>, which on decomposition retains carbonic anhydride, forming
a carbonate, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and marsh gas is given off:</p>

<p class="title">C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>NaO<sub>2</sub> + NaHO = Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + CH<sub>4</sub></p>

<p>Marsh gas is difficult to liquefy; it is almost insoluble in water,
and is without taste or smell. The most important point in connection
with its chemical reactions is that it does not combine directly with
anything, whilst the other hydrocarbons which contain less hydrogen
than expressed by the formula C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i> + 2</sub> are capable of combining with
hydrogen, chlorine, certain acids, &amp;c.</p>

<p>If the law of substitution gives a very simple explanation of the
formation of hydrogen peroxide as a compound containing two
aqueous residues (OH)(OH), then on the basis of this law all hydrocarbons
ought to be derived from methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, as being the simplest
hydrocarbon.<a name="FNanchor_36_482" id="FNanchor_36_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_482" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The increase in complexity of a molecule of methane
is brought about by the faculty of mutual combination which exists in
the atoms of carbon, and, as a consequence of the most detailed study
of the subject, much that might have been foreseen and conjectured
from the law of substitution has been actually brought about in such
a manner as might have been predicted, and although this subject
on account of its magnitude really belongs, as has been already stated,
to the sphere of organic chemistry, it has been alluded to here in order
to show, although only in part, the best investigated example of the
application of the law of substitution. According to this law, a molecule
of methane, CH<sub>4</sub>, is capable of undergoing substitution in the four
following ways:&mdash;(1) Methyl substitution, when the radicle, equivalent
to hydrogen, called <i>methyl</i> CH<sub>3</sub>, replaces hydrogen. In CH<sub>4</sub> this
radicle is combined with H and therefore can replace it, as (OH)
replaces H because with it it gives water; (2) methylene substitution,
or the exchange between H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub> (this radicle is called methylene),
is founded on a similar division of the molecule CH<sub>4</sub> into two equivalent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
parts, H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>; (3) acetylene substitution, or the exchange
between CH on the one hand and H<sub>3</sub> on the other; and (4) carbon
substitution&mdash;that is, the substitution of H<sub>4</sub> by an atom of carbon C,
which is founded on the law of substitution just as is the methyl
substitution. These four cases of substitution render it possible to
understand the principal relations of the hydrocarbons. For instance,
the <i>law of even numbers</i> is seen from the fact that in all the cases of
substitution mentioned the hydrogen atoms increase or decrease by
an even number; but as in CH<sub>4</sub> they are likewise even, it follows that
no matter how many substitutions are effected there will always be
obtained an even number of hydrogen atoms. When H is replaced
by CH<sub>3</sub> there is an increase of CH<sub>2</sub>; when H<sub>2</sub> is replaced by
CH<sub>2</sub> there is no increase of hydrogen; in the acetylene substitution
CH replaces H<sub>3</sub>, therefore there is an increase of C and a decrease of
H<sub>2</sub>; in the carbon substitution there is a decrease of H<sub>4</sub>. In a similar
way the <i>law of limit</i> may be deduced as a corollary of the law of
substitution. For the largest possible quantity of hydrogen is introduced
by the methyl substitution, since it leads to the addition
of CH<sub>2</sub>; starting from CH<sub>4</sub> we obtain C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, and in general,
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>, and these contain the greatest possible amount of hydrogen.
Unsaturated hydrocarbons, containing less hydrogen, are evidently
only formed when the increase of the new molecule derived from
methane proceeds from one of the other forms of substitution.
When the methyl substitution alone takes place in methane, CH<sub>4</sub>,
it is evident that the saturated hydrocarbon formed is C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> or
(CH<sub>3</sub>)(CH<sub>3</sub>).<a name="FNanchor_37_483" id="FNanchor_37_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_483" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This is called <i>ethane</i>. By means of the methylene
substitution alone, <i>ethylene</i>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, or (CH<sub>2</sub>)(CH<sub>2</sub>) may be directly
obtained from CH<sub>4</sub>, and by the acetylene substitution C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
(CH)(CH), or <i>acetylene</i>, both the latter being unsaturated hydrocarbons.
Thus we have all the possible hydrocarbons with two atoms
of carbon in the molecule, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, ethane, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, ethylene, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>,
acetylene. But in them, according to the law of substitution, the
same forms of substitution may be repeated&mdash;that is, the methyl,
methylene, acetylene, and even carbon substitutions (because C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> will
still contain hydrogen when C replaces H<sub>4</sub>) and therefore further substitutions
will serve as a source for the production of a fresh series of
saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons, containing more and more
carbon in the molecule and, in the case of the acetylene substitution
and carbon substitution, containing less and less hydrogen. Thus <i>by
means of the law of substitution we can foresee</i> not only the limit
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>, but an unlimited number of unsaturated hydrocarbons, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>,
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>-2</sub> ... C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2(<i>n-m</i>)</sub>, where <i>m</i> varies from 0 to <i>n</i>-1,<a name="FNanchor_38_484" id="FNanchor_38_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_484" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and
where <i>n</i> increases indefinitely. From these facts not only does the
existence of a multitude of polymeric hydrocarbons, differing in molecular
weight, become intelligible, but it is also seen that there is a possibility
of cases of isomerism with the same molecular weight. This
<i>polymerism</i> so common to hydrocarbon compounds is already apparent
in the first unsaturated series C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>, because all the terms of this
series C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> ... C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>60</sub> ... have one and the
same composition CH<sub>2</sub>, but different molecular weights, as has been
already explained in Chapter <a href="#Page_299">VII</a>. The differences in the vapour
density, boiling points, and melting points, of the quantities
entering into reactions,<a name="FNanchor_39_485" id="FNanchor_39_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_485" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and the methods of preparation<a name="FNanchor_40_486" id="FNanchor_40_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_486" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> also so
clearly tally with the conception of polymerism, that this example will
always be the clearest and most conclusive for the illustration of
polymerism and molecular weight. Such a case is also met with among
other hydrocarbons. Thus benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, and cinnamene, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>8</sub>,
correspond with the composition of acetylene or to a compound of
the composition CH.<a name="FNanchor_41_487" id="FNanchor_41_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_487" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> The first boils at 81°, the second at 144°;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
the specific gravity of the first is 0·899; that of the second, 0·925, at
0°&mdash;that is, here also the boiling point rises with the increase of
molecular weight, and so also, as might be expected, does the density.</p>

<p>Cases of isomerism in the restricted sense of the word&mdash;that is,
when with an identity of composition and of molecular weight, the
properties of the substances are different&mdash;are very numerous among
the hydrocarbons and their derivatives. Such cases are particularly
important for the comprehension of molecular structure and they
also, like the polymerides, may be predicted from the above-mentioned
conceptions, expressing the principles of the structure of the carbon
compounds<a name="FNanchor_42_488" id="FNanchor_42_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_488" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> based on the law of substitution. According to it, for
example, it is evident that there can be no isomerism in the cases of
the saturated hydrocarbons C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, because the former is
CH<sub>4</sub>, in which methyl has taken the place of H, and as all the
hydrogen atoms of methane must be supposed to have the same
relation to the carbon, it is all the same which of them be subjected
to the methyl substitution&mdash;the resulting product can only be ethane,
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>;<a name="FNanchor_43_489" id="FNanchor_43_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_489" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> the same argument also applies in the case of propane,
CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, where one compound only can be imagined. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
is to be expected, however, that there should be two butanes, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>,
and this is actually the case. In one, methyl may be considered
as replacing the hydrogen of one of the methyls, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>;
and in the other CH<sub>3</sub> may be considered as substituted for H in
CH<sub>3</sub>, and there it will consist of CH<sub>3</sub>CH

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">CH<sub>3</sub></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fd">CH<sub>3</sub></span>
</span>.

The latter may also be regarded as methane in which three of hydrogen are exchanged
for three of methyl. On going further in the series it is evident that
the number of possible isomerides will be still greater, but we have
limited ourselves to the simplest examples, showing the possibility and
actual existence of isomerides. C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> and CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub> are, it is evident,
identical; but there ought to be, and are, two hydrocarbons of the
composition C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, propylene and trimethylene; the first is ethylene,
CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>, in which one atom of hydrogen is exchanged for methyl,
CH<sub>2</sub>CHCH<sub>3</sub>, and trimethylene is ethane, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>, with the substitution
of methylene for two hydrogen atoms from two methyl groups&mdash;that
is,

CH<sub>2</sub>

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">CH<sub>2</sub></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fd">CH<sub>2</sub></span>
</span>,<a name="FNanchor_44_490" id="FNanchor_44_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_490" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>

where the methylene introduced is united to both
the atoms of carbon in CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>. It is evident that the cause of
isomerism here is, on the one hand, the difference of the amount
of hydrogen in union with the particular atoms of carbon, and, on the
other, the different connection between the several atoms of carbon.
In the first case they may be said to be chained together (more usually
to form an &lsquo;open chain&rsquo;), and in the second case, to be locked together
(to form a &lsquo;closed chai&rsquo; or &lsquo;ring&rsquo;). Here also it is easily understood
that on increasing the quantity of carbon atoms the number of possible
and existing isomerides will greatly increase. If, at the same time,
in addition to the substitution of one of the radicles of methane for
hydrogen a further exchange of part of the hydrogen for some of
the other groups of elements X, Y ... occurs, the quantity of
possible isomerides still further increases in a considerable degree.
For instance, there are even two possible isomerides for the derivatives
of ethane, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>: if two atoms of the hydrogen be exchanged for X<sub>2</sub>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
one will have the ethylene structure, CH<sub>2</sub>XCH<sub>2</sub>X, and the other an
ethylidene structure, CH<sub>3</sub>CHX<sub>2</sub>; such are, for instance, ethylene
chloride, CH<sub>2</sub>ClCH<sub>2</sub>Cl, and ethylidene chloride, CH<sub>3</sub>CHCl<sub>2</sub>. And as
in the place of the first atom of hydrogen not only metals may be substituted,
but Cl, Br, I, OH (the water radicle), NH<sub>2</sub> (the ammonia radicle),
NO<sub>2</sub> (the radicle of nitric acid), &amp;c., so also in exchange for two
atoms of hydrogen O, NH, S, &amp;c., may be substituted; hence it will
be understood that the quantity of isomerides is sometimes very great.
It is impossible here to describe how the isomerides are distinguished
from each other, in what reactions they occur, how and when one
changes into another, &amp;c.; for this, taken together with the description
of the hydrocarbons already known, and their derivatives, forms a
very extensive and very thoroughly investigated branch of chemistry,
called <i>organic chemistry</i>. Enriched with a mass of closely observed
phenomena and strictly deduced generalisations, this branch of
chemistry has been treated separately for the reason that in it the
hydrocarbon groups are subjected to transformations which are not
met with in such quantity in dealing with any of the other elements
or their hydrogen compounds. It was important for us to show that
notwithstanding the great variety of the hydrocarbons and their
products,<a name="FNanchor_45_491" id="FNanchor_45_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_491" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> they are all of them governed by the law of substitution,
and referring our readers for detailed information to works on organic
chemistry, we will limit ourselves to a short exposition of the properties
of the two simplest unsaturated hydrocarbons: ethylene, CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>, and
acetylene, CHCH, and a short acquaintance with petroleum as the natural
source of a mass of hydrocarbons. <i>Ethylene, or olefiant gas</i>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
is the lowest known member of the unsaturated hydrocarbon series of
the composition C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>. As in composition it is equal to two molecules
of marsh gas deprived of two molecules of hydrogen, it is evident that
it might be, and it actually can be, produced, although but in small
quantities, together with hydrogen, by heating marsh gas. On being
heated, however, olefiant gas splits up, first into acetylene and methane
(3C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> = 2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + 2CH<sub>4</sub>, Lewes, 1894), and at a higher temperature
into carbon and hydrogen; and therefore in those cases where
marsh gas is produced by heating, olefiant gas, hydrogen, and charcoal
will also be formed, although only in small quantities. The lower the
temperature at which complex organic substances are heated, the
greater the quantity of olefiant gas found in the gases given off; at a
white heat it is entirely decomposed into charcoal and marsh gas. If
coal, wood, and more particularly petroleum, tars, and fatty substances,
are subjected to dry distillation, they give off illuminating gas, which
contains more or less olefiant gas.</p>

<p>Olefiant gas, almost free from other gases,<a name="FNanchor_46_492" id="FNanchor_46_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_492" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> may be obtained from
ordinary alcohol (if possible, free from water) if it be mixed with five
parts of strong sulphuric acid and the mixture heated to slightly above
100°. Under these conditions, the sulphuric acid removes the elements
of water from the alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH), and gives olefiant gas;
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub>O + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>. The greater molecular weight of olefiant gas
compared with marsh gas indicates that it may be comparatively easily
converted into a liquid by means of pressure or great cold; this may
be effected, for example, by the evaporation of liquid nitrous oxide.
Its absolute boiling point is +10°, it boils at -103° (1 atmosphere),
liquefies at 0°, at a pressure of 43 atmospheres, and solidifies at -160°.
Ethylene is colourless, has a slight ethereal smell, is slightly soluble in
water, and somewhat more soluble in alcohol and in ether (in five
volumes of spirit and six volumes of ether).<a name="FNanchor_47_493" id="FNanchor_47_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_493" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>

<p>Like other unsaturated hydrocarbons, olefiant gas readily enters
into combination with certain substances, such as chlorine, bromine,
iodine, fuming sulphuric acid, or sulphuric anhydride, &amp;c. If olefiant
gas be sealed up with a small quantity of sulphuric acid in a glass
vessel, and constantly agitated (as, for instance, by attaching it to the
moving part of a machine), the prolonged contact and repeated mixing
causes the olefiant gas, little by little, to combine with the sulphuric
acid, forming C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. If, after this absorption, the sulphuric acid
be diluted with water and distilled, alcohol separates, which is produced
in this case by the olefiant gas combining with the elements of water,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O. In this reaction (Berthelot) we see an excellent
example of the fact that if a given substance, like olefiant gas, is produced
by the decomposition of another, then in the reverse way this substance,
entering into combination, is capable of forming the original substance&mdash;in
our example, alcohol. In combination with various molecules,
X<sub>2</sub>, ethylene gives saturated compounds, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>X<sub>2</sub> or CH<sub>2</sub>XCH<sub>2</sub>X
(for example, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), which correspond with ethane, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> or
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_48_494" id="FNanchor_48_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_494" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><i>Acetylene</i>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> = CHCH, is a gas; it was first prepared by Berthelot
(1857). It has a very pungent smell, is characterised by its
great stability under the action of heat, and is obtained as the only
product of the direct combination of carbon with hydrogen when a
luminous arc (voltaic) is formed between carbon electrodes. This arc
contains particles of carbon passing from one pole to the other. If the
carbons be surrounded with an atmosphere of hydrogen, the carbon in
part combines with the hydrogen, forming C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_48_BIS_495" id="FNanchor_48_BIS_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_BIS_495" class="fnanchor">[48 bis]</a> Acetylene may
be formed from olefiant gas if two atoms of hydrogen be taken
from it. This may be effected in the following way: the olefiant gas is
first made to combine with bromine, giving C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>; from this the
hydrobromic acid is removed by means of an alcoholic solution of
caustic potash, leaving the volatile product C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>Br; and from this
yet another part of hydrobromic acid is withdrawn by passing it through
anhydrous alcohol in which metallic sodium has been dissolved, or by
heating it with a strong alcoholic solution of caustic potash. Under
these circumstances (Berthelot, Sawitsch, Miasnikoff) the alkali takes
up the hydrobromic acid from C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>-1</sub>Br, forming C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>-2</sub>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></p>

<p>Acetylene is also produced in all those cases where organic substances
are decomposed by the action of a high temperature&mdash;for
example, by dry distillation. On this account a certain quantity is
always found in coal gas, and gives to it, at all events in part, its
peculiar smell, but the quantity of acetylene in coal gas is very small.
If the vapour of alcohol be passed through a heated tube a certain
quantity of acetylene is formed. It is also produced by the imperfect
combustion of olefiant and marsh gas&mdash;for example, if the flame of
coal gas has not free access to air.<a name="FNanchor_49_496" id="FNanchor_49_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_496" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The inner part of every flame
contains gases in imperfect combustion, and in them some amount of
acetylene.</p>

<p>Acetylene, being further removed than ethylene from the limit
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub> of hydrocarbon compounds, has a still greater faculty of combination
than is shown by olefiant gas, and therefore can be more readily
separated from any mixture containing it. Actually, acetylene not
only combines with one and two molecules of I<sub>2</sub>, HI, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, Br<sub>2</sub>,
&amp;c.... (many other unsaturated hydrocarbons combine with them),
but also with cuprous chloride, CuCl, forming a red precipitate. If a
gaseous mixture containing acetylene be passed through an ammoniacal
solution of cuprous chloride (or silver nitrate), the other gases do not
combine, but the acetylene gives a red precipitate (or grey with silver),
which detonates when struck with a hammer. This red precipitate
gives off acetylene under the action of acids. In this manner pure
acetylene may be obtained. Acetylene and its homologues also
readily react with corrosive sublimate, HgCl<sub>2</sub> (Koucheroff, Favorsky).
Acetylene burns with a very brilliant flame, which is accounted for
by the comparatively large amount of carbon it contains.<a name="FNanchor_50_497" id="FNanchor_50_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_497" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The formation and existence in nature of large masses of petroleum
or a mixture of liquid hydrocarbons, principally of the series C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>
and C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub> is in many respects remarkable.<a name="FNanchor_51_498" id="FNanchor_51_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_498" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> In some mountainous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
districts&mdash;as, for instance, by the slopes of the Caucasian chain, on
inclines lying in a direction parallel to the range&mdash;an oily liquid issues
from the earth together with salt water and hot gases (methane and
others); it has a tarry smell and dark brown colour, and is lighter than
water. This liquid is called naphtha or rock oil (petroleum) and is
obtained in large quantities by sinking wells and deep bore-holes in
those places where traces of naphtha are observed, the naphtha being
sometimes thrown up from the wells in fountains of considerable
height.<a name="FNanchor_52_499" id="FNanchor_52_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_499" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> The evolution of naphtha is always accompanied by salt
water and marsh gas. Naphtha has from ancient times been worked
in Russia in the Apsheron peninsula near Baku, and is also now
worked in Burmah (India), in Galicia near the Carpathians, and in
America, especially in Pennsylvania and Canada, &amp;c. Naphtha does
not consist of one definite hydrocarbon, but of a mixture of several,
and its density, external appearance, and other qualities vary with the
amount of the different hydrocarbons of which it is composed. The
light kinds of naphtha have a specific gravity about 0·8 and the heavy
kinds up to 0·98. The former are very mobile liquids, and more volatile;
the latter contain less of the volatile hydrocarbons and are less
mobile. When the light kinds of naphtha are distilled, the boiling
point taken in the vapours constantly changes, beginning at 0° and
going up to above 350°. That which passes over first is a very mobile,
colourless ethereal liquid (forming gazolene, ligroin, benzoline, &amp;c.),
from which the hydrocarbons whose boiling points start from 0° may
be extracted&mdash;namely, the hydrocarbons C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub> (which boils
at 30°), C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> (boils at 62°), C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>16</sub> (boils about 90°), &amp;c. Those
fractions of the naphtha distillate which boil above 130°, and contain
hydrocarbons with C<sub>9</sub>, C<sub>10</sub>, C<sub>11</sub>, &amp;c., enter into the composition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
oily substance, universally used for lighting, called kerosene or photogen
or photonaphthalene, and by other names. The specific gravity
of kerosene is from 0·78 to 0·84, and it smells like naphtha. Those
products of the distillation of naphtha which pass off below 130° and
have a specific gravity below 0·75, enter into the composition of light
petroleum (benzoline, ligroin, petroleum spirit, &amp;c.); which is used as
a solvent for india-rubber, for removing grease spots, &amp;c. Those portions
of naphtha (which can only be distilled without change by means
of superheated steam, otherwise they are largely decomposed) which
boil above 275° and up to 300° and have a specific gravity higher
than 0·85, form an excellent oil,<a name="FNanchor_53_500" id="FNanchor_53_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_500" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> safe as regards inflammability
(which is very important as diminishing the risks of fire), and may be
used in lamps as an effective substitute for kerosene.<a name="FNanchor_54_501" id="FNanchor_54_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_501" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Those portions
of naphtha which pass over at a still higher temperature and have a
higher specific gravity than 0·9, which are found in abundance (about
30 p.c.) in the Baku naphtha, make excellent lubricating or machine
oils. Naphtha has many important applications, and the naphtha
industry is now of great commercial importance, especially as naphtha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and its refuse may be used as fuel.<a name="FNanchor_55_502" id="FNanchor_55_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_502" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Whether naphtha was formed
from organic matter is very doubtful, as it is found in the most ancient
Silurian strata which correspond with epochs of the earth's existence
when there was little organic matter; it could not penetrate from the
higher to the lower (more ancient) strata as it floats on water (and
water penetrates through all strata). It therefore tends to rise to the
surface of the earth, and it is always found in highlands parallel to the
direction of the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_56_503" id="FNanchor_56_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_503" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Much more probably its formation may
be attributed to the action of water penetrating through the crevasses
formed on the mountain slopes and reaching to the heart of the
earth, to that kernel of heated metallic matter which must be accepted
as existing in the interior of the earth. And as meteoric iron often
contains carbon (like cast iron), so, accepting the existence of such
carburetted iron at unattainable depths in the interior of the earth, it
may be supposed that naphtha was produced by the action of water
penetrating through the crevices of the strata during the upheaval of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
mountain chains,<a name="FNanchor_57_504" id="FNanchor_57_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_504" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> because water with iron carbide ought to give iron
oxide and hydrocarbons.<a name="FNanchor_58_505" id="FNanchor_58_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_505" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Direct experiment proves that the so-called
<i>spiegeleisen</i> (manganiferous iron, rich in chemically combined carbon)

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_442" id="Footnote_1_442"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_442"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Wood is the non-vital part of ligneous plants: the vital part of ordinary trees is
situated between the bark and the lignin. Every year a layer of lignin is deposited on
this part by the juices which are absorbed by the roots and drawn up by the leaves; for
this reason the age of trees may be determined by the number of lignin layers deposited.
The woody matter consists principally of fibrous tissue on to which the lignin or so-called
incrusting matter has been deposited. The tissue has the composition C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, the
substance deposited on it contains more carbon and hydrogen and less oxygen. This
matter is saturated with moisture when the wood is in a fresh state. Fresh birch wood
contains about 31 p.c. of water, lime wood 47 p.c., oak 35 p.c., pine and fir about 37 p.c.
When dried in the air the wood loses a considerable quantity of water and not more than
19 p.c. remains. By artificial means this loss of water may be increased. If water be driven
into the pores of wood the latter becomes heavier than water, as the lignin of which it is
composed has a density of about 1·6. One cubic centimetre of birch wood does not
weigh more than 0·901 gram, fir 0·894, lime tree 0·817, poplar 0·765 when in a fresh
state; when in a dry state birch weighs 0·622, pine 0·550, fir 0·355, lime 0·430, guaiacum
1·342, ebony 1·226. On one hectare (2·7 acres) of woodland the yearly growth averages
the amount of 3,000 kilograms (or about 3 tons) of wood, but rarely reaches as much as
5,000 kilos. The average chemical composition of wood dried in air may be expressed as
follows:&mdash;Hygroscopic water 15 p.c., carbon 42 p.c., hydrogen 5 p.c., oxygen and nitrogen
37 p.c., ash 1 p.c. Wood parts with its hygroscopic water at 150°, and decomposes at
about 300°, giving a brown, brittle, so-called red charcoal; above 350° black charcoal is
produced. As the hydrogen contained in wood requires for its combustion about forty parts
by weight of oxygen, which is present to the amount of about 36 p.c., all that burns of
the wood is the carbon which it contains, 100 parts of wood only giving out as much heat
as forty parts of charcoal, and therefore it would be far more profitable to use charcoal for
heating purposes than wood, if it were possible to obtain it in such quantities as correspond
with its percentage ratio&mdash;that is forty parts per 100 parts of wood. Generally,
however, the quantity produced is far less, not more than 30 p.c., because part of the
carbon is given off as gas, tar, &amp;c. If wood has to be transported great distances, or if
it is necessary to obtain a very high temperature by burning it, then even as little as
25 p.c. of charcoal from 100 parts of wood may be advantageous. Charcoal (from wood)
develops on burning 8,000 heat units, whilst wood dried in air does not develop more
than 2,800 units of heat; therefore seven parts of charcoal give as much heat as twenty
parts of wood. As regards the temperature of combustion, it is far higher with charcoal
than with wood, because twenty parts of burning wood give, besides the carbonic anhydride
which is also formed together with charcoal, eleven parts of water, the evaporation of
which requires a considerable amount of heat.</p>

vary.</p></div>

<p>The composition of the growing parts of plants, the leaves, young branches, shoots, &amp;c.,
differs from the composition of the wood in that these vital parts contain a considerable
quantity of sap which contains much nitrogenous matter (in the wood itself there is very
little), mineral salts, and a large amount of water. Taking, for example, the composition
of clover and pasture hay in the green and dry state; in 100 parts of green clover there
is about 80 p.c. of water and 20 p.c. of dry matter, in which there are about 3·5 parts of
nitrogenous albuminous matter, about 9·5 parts of soluble and about 5 parts of insoluble
non-nitrogenous matter, and about 2 p.c. of ash. In dry clover or clover-hay there is about
15 p.c. of water, 13 p.c. of nitrogenous matter, and 7 p.c. of ash. This composition of
grassy substances shows that they are capable of forming the same sort of charcoal as
wood itself. It also shows the difference of nutritive properties existing between wood
and the substances mentioned. These latter serve as food for animals, because they
contain those substances which are capable of being dissolved (entering into the blood)
and forming the body of animals; such substances are proteids, starch, &amp;c. Let us
remark here that with a good harvest an acre of land gives in the form of grass as much
organic substance as it yields in the form of wood.</p>

<p>One hundred parts of dry wood are capable of giving, on dry distillation, besides
25 p.c. of charcoal and 10 p.c. or more of tar, 40 p.c. of watery liquid, containing acetic
acid and wood spirit, and about 25 p.c. of gases, which may be used for heating or
lighting purposes, because they do not differ from ordinary illuminating gas, which can
indeed be obtained from wood. As wood-charcoal and tar are valuable products, in some
cases the dry distillation of wood is carried on principally for producing them. For this
purpose those kinds of woods are particularly advantageous which contain resinous substances,
especially coniferous trees, such as fir, pine, &amp;c.; birch, oak, and ash give much
less tar, but on the other hand they yield more aqueous liquor. The latter is used for the
manufacture of wood spirit, CH<sub>4</sub>O, and acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In such cases, the dry distillation
is carried on in stills. The stills are nothing more than horizontal or vertical
cylindrical retorts, made of boiler plate, heated with fuel and having apertures at
the top and sometimes also at the bottom for the exit of the light and heavy products
of distillation. The dry distillation of wood in stoves is carried on in two ways,
either by burning a portion of the wood inside the stove in order to submit the remainder
to dry distillation by means of the heat obtained in this manner, or by placing the wood
in a stove the thin sides of which are surrounded with a flue leading from the fuel,
placed in a space below.</p>

<p>The first method does not give such a large amount of liquid products of the dry
distillation as the latter. In the latter process there is generally an outlet below for
emptying out the charcoal at the close of the operation. For the dry distillation of 100
parts of wood from forty to twenty parts of fuel are used.</p>

<p>In the north of Russia wood is so plentiful and cheap that this locality is admirably
fitted to become the centre of a general trade in the products of its dry distillation.
Coal (Note <a href="#Footnote_6_447">6</a>), sea-weed, turf, animal substances (Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>.), &amp;c., are also submitted
to the process of dry distillation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_443" id="Footnote_2_443"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_443"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The result of imperfect combustion is not only the loss of a part of the fuel and the
production of smoke, which in some respects is inconvenient and injurious to health, but
also a low flame temperature, which means that a less amount of heat is transmitted to
the object heated. Imperfect combustion is not only always accompanied by the formation
of soot or unburnt particles of charcoal, but also by that of carbonic oxide, CO, in the
smoke (Chapter <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>.) which burns, emitting much heat. In works and factories where
large quantities of fuel are consumed, many appliances are adopted to ensure perfect combustion,
and to combat against such a ruinous practice as the imperfect combustion of
fuel. The most effective and radical means consists in employing combustible gases
(producer and water gases), because by their aid perfect combustion can be easily
realised without a loss of heat-producing power and the highest temperature can
be reached. When solid fuel is used (such as coal, wood, and turf), imperfect combustion
is most liable to occur when the furnace doors are opened for the introduction of fresh
fuel. The step furnace may often prove a remedy for this defect. In the ordinary
furnace fresh fuel is placed on the burning fuel, and the products of dry distillation of
the fresh fuel have to burn at the expense of the oxygen remaining uncombined with
the burnt fuel. Imperfect combustion is observed in this case also from the fact that
the dry distillation and evaporation of the water of the fresh fuel lying on the top of that
burnt, lowers the temperature of the flame, because part of the heat becomes latent.
On this account a large amount of smoke (imperfect combustion) is observed when a fresh
quantity of fuel is introduced into the furnace. This may be obviated by constructing
the furnace (or managing the stoking) in such a way that the products of distillation pass
through the red-hot charcoal remaining from the burnt fuel. It is only necessary in
order to ensure this to allow a sufficient quantity of air for perfect combustion. All this
may be easily attained by the use of step fire-bars. The fuel is fed into a hopper and
falls on to the fire-bars, which are arranged in the form of a staircase. The burning
charcoal is below, and hence the flame formed by the fresh fuel is heated by the contact
of the red-hot burning charcoal. An air supply through the fire grate, an equal distribution
of the fuel on the fire-bars (otherwise the air will blow through empty spaces and
lower the temperature), a proper proportion between the supply of air and the chimney
draught, and a perfect admixture of air with the flame (without an undue excess of air),
are the means by which we can contend against the imperfect combustion of such kinds
of fuel as wood, peat, and ordinary (smoky) coal. Coke, charcoal, anthracite, burn without
smoke, because they do not contain hydrogenous substances which furnish the products
of dry distillation, but imperfect combustion may occur with them also; in that
case the smoke contains carbonic oxide.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_444" id="Footnote_3_444"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_444"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Under the action of air, organic substances are capable of oxidising to such an extent
that all the carbon and all the hydrogen they contain will be transformed into carbonic anhydride
and water. The refuse of plants and that of animals are subjected to such a change
whether they slowly decompose and putrefy, or rapidly burn with direct access of air. But
if the supply of air be limited, there can be no complete transformation into water and
carbonic anhydride, there will be other volatile matters (rich in hydrogen), while charcoal
must remain as a non-volatile substance. All organic substances are unstable, they do not
resist heat, and change even at ordinary temperatures, particularly if water be present. It
is therefore easy to understand that charcoal may in many cases be obtained through the
transformation of substances entering into the composition of organisms, but that it is
never found in a pure state.</p>

<p>However, water and carbonic anhydride are not the only products separated from
organic substances. Carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen are capable of giving a multitude of
compounds; some of these are volatile compounds, gaseous, soluble in water&mdash;they are
carried off from organic matter, undergoing change without access of air. Others, on the
contrary, are non-volatile, rich in carbon, unaffected by heat and other agents. The latter
remain in admixture with charcoal in the place where the decomposition takes place; such,
for example, are tarry substances. The quantity of those bodies which are found mixed
with the charcoal is very varied, and depends on the energy and duration of the decomposing
agent. The annexed table shows, according to the data of Violette, those changes
which wood undergoes at various temperatures when submitted to dry distillation by
means of superheated steam:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_445" id="Footnote_4_445"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_445"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The object of producing charcoal from wood has been explained in Note <a href="#Footnote_1_442">1</a>.
<i>Wood charcoal</i> is obtained in so-called stacks by partially burning the wood, or by
means of dry distillation (Note <a href="#Footnote_1_442">1</a>) without the access of air. It is principally manufactured
for metallurgical processes, especially for smelting and forging iron. The
preparation of charcoal in stacks has one advantage, and that is that it may be done
on any spot in the forest. But in this way all the products of dry distillation are lost.
For charcoal burning, a pile or stack is generally built, in which the logs are placed
close together, either horizontally, vertically, or inclined, forming a stack of from six
to fifty feet in diameter and even larger. Under the stack are several horizontal air
passages, and an opening in the middle to let out the smoke. The surface of the stack is
covered with earth and sods to a considerable thickness, especially the upper part, in
order to hinder the free passage of air and to concentrate the heat inside. When the
stack is kindled, the pile begins to settle down by degrees, and it is then necessary to
look after the turf casing and keep it in repair. As the combustion spreads throughout
the whole pile, the temperature rises and real dry distillation commences. It is then
necessary to stop the air holes, in order as much as possible to prevent unnecessary combustion.
The nature of the process is, that part of the fuel burns and develops the heat
required for subjecting the remainder to dry distillation. The charring is stopped when
the products of dry distillation, which are emitted, no longer burn with a brilliant flame,
but the pale blue flame of carbonic oxide appears. Dry wood in stacks yields about one-fourth
of its weight of charcoal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_446" id="Footnote_5_446"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_446"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> When dead vegetable matter undergoes transformation in air, in the presence of
moisture and lower organisms, there remains a substance much richer in carbon&mdash;namely,
humus, black earth or mould. 100 parts of humus in a dry state contain about 70 p.c. of
carbon. The roots, leaves, and stems of plants which wither and fall to the ground form
a soil rich in humus. The non-vital vegetable substances (ligneous tissue) first form
brown matter (ulmic compounds), and then black matter (humic substances), which are
both insoluble in water; after this a brown acid is produced, which is soluble in water
(apocrenic acid), and lastly a colourless acid also soluble in water (crenic acid). Alkali dissolves
a part of the original brown and black substances, forming solutions of a brown tint
(ulmic and humic acids) which sometimes communicate their colour to springs and rivers.
The proportion of humus in soil generally has a direct influence on its fertility; firstly,
because putrefying plants develop carbonic anhydride and ammonia, and yield the substances
forming the ashes of plants, which are necessary to vegetation; secondly, because
humus is capable of attracting the moisture of the air and of absorbing water (twice its
weight) and in this way keeps the soil in a damp condition, which is indispensable for
nourishment; thirdly, humus renders the soil porous, and, fourthly, it renders it more
capable of absorbing the heat of the sun's rays. On this account black earth is often
most remarkable for its fertility. One object of manuring is to increase the quantity of
humus in the soil, and any easily changeable vegetable or any animal matter (composts)
may be used. The boundless tracts of black earth soil in Russia are capable of bestowing
countless wealth on the country.</p>

<p>The origin and extent of black earth soil are treated in detail in Professor Dokouchaeff's
works.</p>

<p>If those substances which produce humus undergo decomposition under water, less
carbonic anhydride is formed, a quantity of marsh gas, CH<sub>4</sub>, is evolved, and the solid
residue forms an acid humus found in great quantities in marshy places and called
<i>peat</i>. Peat is especially abundant in the lowlands of Holland, North Germany,
Ireland, and Bavaria. In Russia it is likewise found in large quantities, especially in
the North-West districts. The old hard forms of peat resemble in composition and properties
brown coal; the newest formations, as yet unhardened by pressure, form very
porous masses which retain traces of the vegetable matter from which they have been
formed. Dried (and sometimes pressed) peat is used as fuel. The composition of peat
varies considerably with the locality in which it is found. When dried in air it does not
contain less than 15 p.c. of water and 8 p.c. of ash; the remainder consists of 45 p.c. of
carbon, 4 p.c. of hydrogen, 1 p.c. of nitrogen, and 28 p.c. of oxygen. Its heating power
is about equivalent to that of wood. The brown earthy varieties of coal were probably
formed from peat. In other cases they have a marked woody structure, and are then
known as lignites. The composition of the brown sorts of coal resembles in a marked
degree that of peat&mdash;namely, in a dried state brown coal contains on an average 60 p.c.
of carbon, 5 p.c. of hydrogen, 26 p.c. of oxygen and nitrogen, and 9 p.c. of ash. In
Russia brown coal is met with in many districts near Moscow, in the Governments of
Toula and Tver and the neighbourhood; it is very usually used as fuel, particularly
when found in thick seams. The brown coals usually burn with a flame like wood and
peat, and are akin to them in heating power, which is half or a third that of the best
coal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_447" id="Footnote_6_447"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_447"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> Grass and wood, the vegetation of primæval seas and similar refuse of all geological
periods, must have been in many cases subjected to the same changes they now
undergo&mdash;that is, under water they formed peat and lignites. Such substances, preserved
or a long time underground, subjected to the action of water, compressed by the
new strata formed above them, transformed by the separation of their more volatile
component parts (peat and lignites, even in their last condition, still continue to evolve
nitrogen, carbonic anhydride, and marsh gases) form <i>coal</i>. Coal is a dense homogeneous
mass, black, with an oily or glassy lustre, or more rarely dull without any evident vegetable
structure; this distinguishes it in appearance from the majority of lignites. The
density of coal (not counting the admixture of pyrites, &amp;c.) varies from 1·25 (dry bituminous
coal) to 1·6 (anthracite, flameless), and even reaches 1·9 in the very dense variety
of coal found in the Olonetzky government (termed shungite), which according to the
investigations of Professor Inostrantzeff may be regarded as the extreme member of the
various forms of coal.</p>

<p>In order to explain the formation of coal from vegetable matter, Cagniard de la Tour
enclosed pieces of dried wood in a tube and heated them to the boiling point of mercury,
when the wood was changed into a semi-liquid black mass from which a substance
exceedingly like coal separated. In this manner some kinds of wood formed coal which
on being heated left caking coke, others non-caking; precisely as we find with the
natural varieties of coal. Violette repeated these experiments with wood dried at 150°,
and showed that when wood is decomposed in this way, a gas, an aqueous liquor, and a
residue are formed. The latter at a temperature of 200° has the properties of wood
charcoal incompletely burnt; at 300° and higher a homogeneous mass like coal is formed
which at 340° is dense and without cavities. At 400° the residue resembles anthracite.
In nature probably the decomposition was in rare cases effected by heat alone; more
generally it was effected by means of water and heat, but in either case the result ought
to be almost the same.</p>

<p>The average composition of coal compiled from many analyses, disregarding the ash,
is as follows: 84 parts of carbon, 5 parts of hydrogen, 1 part of nitrogen, 8 parts of
oxygen, 2 of sulphur. The quantity of ash is on an average 5 p.c., but there are coals which
contain a larger quantity, and naturally they are not so advantageous for use as fuel.
The amount of water does not usually exceed more than 10 p.c. The <i>anthracites</i> form
a remarkable variety of coals, they do not give any volatile products, or but a very small
amount, as they contain but little hydrogen compared to oxygen. In the average composition
of coal we saw that for 5 parts of hydrogen there were 8 parts of oxygen;
therefore 4 parts by weight of hydrogen are capable of forming hydrocarbons, because
1 part of hydrogen is necessary in order to form water with the 8 parts of oxygen. These
4 parts by weight of hydrogen can convert 48 parts of carbon into volatile products,
because 1 part of hydrogen by weight in these substances combines with 12 parts of
carbon. The anthracites differ essentially from this: neglecting the ash, their average
composition is as follows: 94 parts of carbon, 3 of hydrogen, and 3 of oxygen and
nitrogen. According to the analyses of A. A. Voskresensky, the Grousheffsky anthracite
(Don district) contains: C = 93·8, H = 1·7, ash = 1·5. Therefore the anthracites contain
but little hydrogen capable of combining with the carbon to form hydrocarbons which
burn with a flame. Anthracites are the oldest forms of coal. The newest and least transformed
coals, which resemble some of the brown varieties, are the <i>dry</i> coals. They burn
with a flame like wood, and leave a coke having the appearance of lumps of coal, half
their component parts being absorbed by the flame (they contain much hydrogen and
oxygen). The remaining varieties of coal (gas coal, smithy coal, coking, and anthracite)
according to Grüner in all respects form connecting links between the <i>dry</i> coals and
the anthracites. These coals burn with a very smoky flame, and on being heated leave
<i>coke</i>, which bears the same relation to coal that charcoal does to wood. The quantity and
quality of coke vary considerably with the different sorts of coal from which it is
formed. In practice coals are most often distinguished by the properties and quantity
of the coke which they give. In this particular the so-called bituminous coals are
especially valuable, as even the slack of this kind gives on dry distillation large spongy
masses of coke. If large pieces of these kinds of coal are subjected to dry distillation,
they, as it were, melt, flow together, and form caking masses of coke. The best coking
coals give 65 p.c. of dense caking coke. Such coal is very valuable for metallurgical
purposes (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_8_449">8</a>). Besides coke, the dry distillation of coal produces gas (<i>see</i> further,
illuminating gas, p. <a href="#Page_361">361</a>), coal-tar (which gives benzene, carbolic acid, naphthalene, tar
for artificial asphalt, &amp;c.) and also an aqueous alkaline liquor (with wood and lignites
the liquid is acid from acetic acid) which contains ammonium carbonate (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_6_447">6</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_448" id="Footnote_7_448"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_448"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> In England in 1850 the output of coal was as much as 48 million tons, and in latter
years it has risen to about 190 millions. Besides this other countries contribute 300
millions&mdash;Russia about 6 millions. The United States of America come next to England
with an output of 160 million tons, then Germany 90 millions; France produces but
little (25 millions), and takes about 5 million tons from England. Thus the world consumes
about 500 million tons of coal yearly. Besides household purposes, coal is
chiefly used as fuel for steam-engines. As every horse-power (= 75 kilogrammetres per
second) of a steam-engine expends on the average more than 25 kilograms in 24 hours,
or in a year (counting stoppages) not less than 5 tons per horse-power, and there are not
less than 40 million horse-power at work in the world, the consumption of coal for
motive-power is at least equal to half the whole production. For this reason coal
serves as a criterion of the industrial development of a country. About 15 p.c. of
coal is used for the manufacture of cast iron, wrought iron, steel, and articles made of
them.</p></div>

and other <i>wealth of the Don coal basin</i>, give complete assurance of the fact that with
the growth of industrial activity in Russia this bountiful land of the Cossacks and New
Russia will become the centre of the most extensive productive enterprise, not for
the requirements of Russia alone, but of the whole world, because in no other place can
be found such a concentration of favourable conditions. The growth of enterprise and
knowledge, together with the extinction of the forests which compels Russia to foster
the production of coal, will help to bring about this desired result. England with a
whole fleet of merchant vessels exports annually about 25 million tons of coal, the price
of which is higher than on the Donetz (where a pood of worked coal costs less than 5
copecks on the average), where anthracites and semi-anthracites (like Cardiff or steam
coal, which burns without smoke) and coking and metallurgical coals are able both in
quantity and quality to satisfy the most fastidious requirements of the industry already
existing and rapidly increasing everywhere. The coal mines of England and Belgium
are approaching a state of exhaustion, whilst in those of the Don basin, only at a depth
of 100 fathoms, 1,200,000 million poods of coal lie waiting to be worked.</p></div>

earthy matter contained in the vegetable substance used for producing charcoal&mdash;in order
to obtain it in its purest condition it is necessary to use such organic substances as do
not contain any ash, for example completely refined or purified crystallised sugar,
crystallised tartaric acid, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_451" id="Footnote_10_451"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_451"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The cavities in charcoal are the passages through which those volatile products
formed at the same time as the charcoal have passed. The degree of porosity of charcoal
varies considerably, and has a technical significance, in different kinds of charcoal.
The most porous charcoal is very light; a cubic metre of wood charcoal weighs about
200 kilograms. Many of the properties of charcoal which depend exclusively on its
porosity are shared by many other porous substances, and vary with the density of the
charcoal and depend on the way it was prepared. The property which charcoal has of
absorbing gases, liquids, and many substances in solution, is a case in point. The
densest kind of charcoal is formed by the action of great heat on sugar and other fusible
substances. The lustrous grey dense coke formed in gas retorts is also of this character.
This dense coke collects on the internal walls of the retorts subjected to great heat,
and is produced by the vapours and gases separated from the heated coal in the retorts.
In virtue of its density such coke becomes a good conductor of the galvanic current
and approaches graphite. It is principally used in galvanic batteries. Coke, or the charcoal
remaining from the imperfect combustion of coal and tarry substances, is also but
slightly porous, brilliant, does not soil or mark paper, is dense, almost devoid of the
faculty of retaining liquids and solids, and does not absorb gases. The light sorts of
charcoal produced from charred wood, on the other hand, show this absorptive power in
a most marked degree. This property is particularly developed in that very fine and
friable charcoal prepared by heating animal substances such as hides and bones. <i>The
absorptive power of charcoal</i> for gases is similar to the condensation of gases in spongy
platinum. Here evidently there is a case of the adherence of gases to a solid, precisely
as liquids have the property of adhering to various solids. One volume of charcoal will
absorb the following volumes of gases (charcoal is capable of absorbing an immense
amount of chlorine, almost equal to its own weight):&mdash;</p>

<p>The quantity of gas absorbed by the charcoal increases with the pressure, and is
approximately proportional to it. The quantity of heat given out by the absorption
nearly approaches that set free on dissolving, or passing into a liquid condition.</p>

<p>Charcoal absorbs not only gases, but a number of other substances. For instance,
alcohol which contains disagreeably smelling fusel oil, on being mixed with charcoal or
filtered through it, loses most of the fusel oil. The practice of filtering substances
through charcoal in order to get rid of foreign matters is often applied in chemical and
manufacturing processes. Oils, spirits, various extracts, and vegetable and other solutions
are filtered through charcoal in order to purify them. The bleaching power of
charcoal may be tested by using various coloured solutions&mdash;such as aniline dyes, litmus,
&amp;c. Charcoal, which has absorbed one substance to saturation is still capable of
absorbing certain other substances. Animal charcoal, produced in a very finely-divided
state, especially by heating bones, makes the best sort for the purposes of absorption.
Bone charcoal is used in large quantities in sugar works for filtering syrups and all
saccharine solutions, in order to purify them, not only from colouring and odorous
matter, but also from the lime which is mixed with the syrups in order to render them less
unstable during boiling. The absorption of lime by animal charcoal depends, in all
probability, in a great degree on the mineral component parts of bone charcoal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_452" id="Footnote_11_452"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_452"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Charcoal is a very bad conductor of heat, and therefore forms an excellent
insulator or packing to prevent the transmission of heat. A charcoal lining is often used
in crucibles for heating many substances, as it does not melt and resists a far greater
heat than many other substances.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_453" id="Footnote_12_453"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_453"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The unalterability of charcoal under the action of atmospheric agencies, which
produce changes in the majority of stony and metallic substances, is often made use of
in practice. For example, charcoal is frequently strewn in boundary ditches. The
surface of wood is often charred to render it durable in those places where the soil is
damp and wood itself would soon rot. The chambers (or in some works towers) through
which acids pass (for example, sulphuric and hydrochloric) in order to bring them into
contact with gases or liquids, are filled with charcoal or coke, because at ordinary temperatures
it resists the action of even the strongest acids.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_BIS_454" id="Footnote_12_BIS_454"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_BIS_454"><span class="label">[12 bis]</span></a> Maquenne (1892) discovered that carbon is capable of combining with the alkali
metals. A 20 p.c. amalgam of the metals was heated to a red heat with charcoal powder
in a stream of hydrogen. The compounds so obtained possessed, after the mercury had
been driven off, the compositions BaC<sub>2</sub>, SrC<sub>2</sub>, CaC<sub>2</sub>. All these compounds react with
water forming acetylene, for example:</p>

<p class="title">BaC<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> + Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub></p>

<p>Maquenne proposes the barium carbide as a source of acetylene. He obtained this
compound by heating carbonate of barium, magnesium powder, and retort carbon in a
Perreau furnace (BaCO<sub>3</sub> + 3Mg + C = 3MgO + BaC<sub>2</sub>). One hundred grams of BaC<sub>2</sub> evolve
5,200 to 5,400 c.c. of acetylene, mixed with about 2&ndash;3 p.c. of hydrogen.</p>

<p>The relation of acetylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, to these metallic carbides is evident from the fact
that these metals (Ca, Sr, Ba) replace 2 atoms of hydrogen, and therefore C<sub>2</sub>Ba corresponds
to C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, so that they may be regarded as metallic derivatives of acetylene.
Moissan (1893) obtained similar carbides directly from the oxides by subjecting them to
the action of the voltaic arc, in the presence of carbon, for instance, BaO + 3C = CO + C<sub>2</sub>Ba,
although at a furnace heat carbon has no action on the oxides CaO, BaO, SrO. Concerning
Al<sub>4</sub>C<sub>5</sub>, <i>see</i> Chapter XVII. Note 38.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_455" id="Footnote_13_455"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_455"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> When subjected to pressure, charcoal loses heat, hence the densest form stands to
the less dense as a solid to a liquid, or as a compound to an element. From this the
conclusion may be drawn that the molecules of graphite are more complex than those
of charcoal, and those of the diamond still more so. The specific heat shows the same
variation, and as we shall see further on, the increased complexity of a molecule leads to a
diminution of the specific heat. At ordinary temperatures the specific heat of charcoal is
0·24, graphite 0·20, the diamond 0·147. For retort carbon Le Chatelier (1893) found that
the product of the sp. heat and atomic weight varies, between 0° and 250°, according to
the formula: = 1·92 + 0·0077<i>t</i>, and between 250° and 1000°, = 3·54 + 0·00246<i>t</i> (<i>see</i>
Chapter XIV. Note <a href="#Footnote_4_831">4</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_456" id="Footnote_14_456"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_456"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> There are places where anthracite gradually changes into graphite as the strata

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_457" id="Footnote_15_457"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_457"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Pencils are made of graphite worked up into a homogeneous mass by disintegrating,
powdering, and cleansing it from earthy impurities; the best kinds are made of
completely homogeneous graphite sawn up into the requisite sticks. Graphite is found
in many places. In Russia the so-called Aliberoffsky graphite is particularly renowned;
it is found in the Altai mountains near the Chinese frontier; in many places in Finland
and likewise on the banks of the Little Tungouska, Sidoroff also found a considerable
quantity of graphite. When mixed with clay, graphite is used for making crucibles and
pots for melting metals.</p>

<p>Graphite, like most forms of charcoal, still contains a certain quantity of hydrogen,
oxygen, and ash, so that in its natural state it does not contain more than 98 <i>p.c.</i> of
carbon.</p>

<p>In practice, graphite is purified simply by washing it when in a finely-ground state,
by which means the bulk of the earthy matter may be separated. The following process,
proposed by Brodie, consists in mixing the powdered graphite with <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>14</sub> part of its weight
of potassium chlorate. The mixture is then heated with twice its weight of strong
sulphuric acid until no more odoriferous gases are emitted; on cooling, the mixture is
thrown into water and washed; the graphite is then dried and heated to a red heat;
after this it shrinks considerably in volume and forms a very fine powder, which is
then washed. By acting on graphite several times with a mixture of potassium chlorate
and nitric acid heated up to 60°, Brodie transformed it into a yellow insoluble acid
substance which he called graphitic acid, C<sub>11</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. The diamond remains unchanged
when subjected to this treatment, whilst amorphous charcoal is completely oxidised.
Availing himself of this possibility of distinguishing graphite from the diamond or amorphous
charcoal, Berthelot showed that when compounds of carbon and hydrogen are
decomposed by heat, amorphous charcoal is mainly formed, whilst when compounds of
carbon with chlorine, sulphur, and boron are decomposed, graphite is principally
deposited.</p></div>

itacolumite, and are dug out of the <i>débris</i> produced by the destruction of the
itacolumite by water. When the <i>débris</i> is washed the diamonds remain behind; they
are principally found in Brazil, in the provinces of Rio and Bahia, and at the Cape of
Good Hope. The <i>débris</i> gives the black or amorphous diamond, carbonado, and the
ordinary colourless or yellow translucent diamond. As the diamond possesses a very
marked cleavage, the first operation consists in splitting it, and then roughly and finely
polishing it with diamond powder. It is very remarkable that Professors P. A. Latchinoff
and Eroféeff found (1887) diamond powder in a meteoric stone which fell in the Government
of Penza, in the district of Krasnoslobodsk, near the settlement of Novo Urei
(Sept. 10, 1886). Up to that time charcoal and graphite (a special variety, cliftonite) had
been found in meteorites and the diamond only conjectured to occur therein. The Novo
Urei meteorite was composed of siliceous matter and metallic iron (with nickel) like
many other meteorites.</p></div>

impossible to cut them because directly the surface is ground or broken they fall into
minute pieces. Sometimes minute diamond crystals form a dense mass like sugar, and
this is generally reduced to diamond powder and used for grinding. Some known
varieties of the diamond are almost opaque and of a black colour. Such diamonds are
as hard as the ordinary ones, and are used for polishing diamonds and other precious
stones, and also for rock boring and tunnelling.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_461" id="Footnote_17_461"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_461"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> The <i>electrical furnace</i> is an invention of recent times, and gives the possibility of
obtaining a temperature of 3,500°, which is not only not obtainable in ordinary furnaces,
but even in the oxyhydrogen flame, whose temperature does not exceed 2,000°. The electrical
furnace consists of two pieces of lime, laid one on the other. A cavity is made in
the lower piece for the reception of the substance to be melted between two thick
electrodes of dense carbon. On passing a current of 70 volts and 450 ampères a temperature
of 3,000° is easily obtained. At a temperature of 2,500° (100 ampères and 40
volts) not only do all metals melt, but even lime and magnesia (when placed in the space
between the carbon electrodes, <i>i.e.</i> in the voltaic arc) become soft and crystallise on
cooling. At 3,000° lime becomes very fluid, metallic calcium partially separates
out and a carbon compound, which remains liquid for a long time. At this temperature
oxide of uranium is reduced to the suboxide and metal, zirconia and rock
crystal fuse and partially volatilise, as also does alumina; platinum, gold, and even
carbon distinctly volatilise; the majority of the metals form carbides. At such a temperature
also cast iron and carbon give graphite, while according to Rousseau, between
2,000° and 3,000° the diamond passes into graphite and conversely graphite into the
diamond, so that this is a kind of reversible reaction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_BIS_462" id="Footnote_17_BIS_462"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_BIS_462"><span class="label">[17 bis]</span></a> Moissan first investigated the solution of carbon in molten metals (and the
formation of the carbides) such as magnesium, aluminium, iron, manganese, chromium,
uranium, silver, platinum, and silicon. At the same time Friedel, owing to the discovery
of the diamond in meteoric iron, admitted that the formation of the diamond is dependent
upon the influence of iron and sulphur. With this object, that is to obtain the
diamond, Friedel caused sulphur to react upon samples of cast iron rich in carbon, in a
closed vessel at a maximum temperature of 500°, and after dissolving the sulphide of iron
formed, he obtained a small quantity of a black powder which scratched corundum, i.e.
diamond. Moissan's experiments (1893) were more successful, probably owing to his
having employed the electrical furnace. If iron be saturated with carbon at a temperature
between 1,100° and 3,000°, then at 1,100°&ndash;1,200° a mixture of amorphous
carbon and graphite is formed, while at 3,000° graphite alone is obtained in very
beautiful crystals. Thus under these conditions the diamond is not formed, and it can
only be obtained if the high temperature be aided by powerful pressures. For this
purpose Moissan took advantage of the pressure produced in the passage of a mass of
molten cast iron from a liquid into a solid state. He first melted 150&ndash;200 grams of iron
in the electrical furnace, and quickly introduced a cylinder of carbon into the molten
iron. He then removed the crucible with the molten iron from the furnace and plunged
it into a reservoir containing water. After treating with boiling hydrochloric acid, three
varieties of carbon were obtained: (1) a small amount of graphite (if the cooling be
rapid); (2) carbon of a chestnut colour in very fine twisted threads, showing that it had
been subjected to a very high pressure (a similar variety was met with in various
samples of the Canon Diabolo), and lastly (3) an inconsiderable quantity of an
exceeding dense mass which was freed from the admixture of the lighter modifications
by treatment with <i>aqua regia</i>, sulphuric and hydrofluoric acids, and from which Moissan,
by means of liquid bromoform (sp. gr. 2·900), succeeded in separating some small pieces,
having a greater density than bromoform, which scratched the ruby and had the
properties of the diamond. Some of these pieces were black, others were transparent
and refracted light strongly. The dark grey tint of the former resembled that of the
black diamonds (carbonado). Their density was between 3 and 3·5. The transparent
specimens had a greasy appearance and seemed to be, as it were, surrounded by an
envelope of carbon. At 1,050° they did not burn entirely in a current of air, so that the
imperfectly burnt particles, and a peculiar form of grains of a light ochre colour,
which retained their crystalline form, could be examined under the microscope. Similar
grains also remain after the imperfect combustion of the ordinary diamond. Moissan
obtained the same results by rapidly cooling in a stream of coal gas a piece of cast iron,
saturated with carbon obtained from sugar and first heated to 2,000°. In this instance
he obtained small crystals of diamonds. K. Chroustchoff showed that at its boiling
point silver dissolves 6 p.c. of carbon. This silver was rapidly cooled, so that a crust
formed on the surface and prevented the metal expanding, and so produced a powerful
pressure. A portion of the carbon which separates out under these conditions exhibits
the properties of the diamond.</p></div>

increase. They present a marked approach to the properties of the diamond. And in
proportion to the diminution of the water in the carbohydrates C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>m</i></sub>O<sub><i>m</i></sub>&mdash;for example
in the humic compounds (Note <a href="#Footnote_5_446">5</a>)&mdash;the transition of complex organic substances to
charcoal is very evident. That residue resembling charcoal and graphite which is
obtained by the separation (by means of copper sulphate and sodium chloride) of iron
from white cast-iron containing carbon chemically combined with the iron, also seems,
especially after the researches of G. A. Zaboudsky, to be a complex substance containing
C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. The endeavours which have been directed towards determining the measure
of complexity of the molecules of charcoal, graphite, and the diamond will probably at
some period lead to the solution of this problem and will most likely prove that the
various forms of charcoal, graphite, and the diamond contain molecules of different and
very considerable complexity. The constancy of the grouping of benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, and the
wide diffusion and facility of formation of the carbohydrates containing C<sub>6</sub> (for example,
cellulose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, glucose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>) give reason for thinking that the group C<sub>6</sub> is the
first and simplest of those possible to free carbon, and it may be hoped that some time
or other it may be possible to get carbon in this form. Perhaps in the diamond there
may be found such a relation between the atoms as in the benzene group, and in charcoal
such as in carbohydrates.</p></div>

friction. It is estimated by passing the liquids through narrow (capillary) tubes, the
mobile liquids passing through with greater facility and speed than the viscid ones. The
viscosity varies with the temperature and nature of the liquids, and in the case of solutions
changes with the amount of the substance dissolved, but is not proportional to it.
So that, for example, with alcohol at 20° the viscosity will be 69, and for a 50 p.c. solution
160, the viscosity of water being taken as 100. The volume of the liquid which
passes through by experiment (Poiseuille) and theory (Stokes) is proportional to the
time, the pressure, and the fourth power of the diameter of the (capillary) tube, and
inversely proportional to the length of the tube; this renders it possible to form comparative
estimates of the coefficients of internal friction and viscosity.</p>

<p>As the complexity of the molecules of hydrocarbons and their derivatives increases
by the addition of carbon (or CH<sub>2</sub>), so does the degree of viscosity also rise. The extensive
series of investigations referring to this subject still await the necessary generalisation.
That connection which (already partly observed) ought to exist between the
viscosity and the other physical and chemical properties, forces us to conclude that the
magnitude of internal friction plays an important part in molecular mechanics. In
investigating organic compounds and solutions, similar researches ought to stand foremost.
Many observations have already been made, but not much has yet been done
with them; the bare facts and some mechanical data exist, but their relation to molecular
mechanics has not been cleared up in the requisite degree. It has already been seen
from existing data that the viscosity at the temperature of the absolute boiling point
becomes as small as in gases.</p></div>

for the hydrogen may be attained by indirect means. The property shown by acetylene,

characteristic. Judging from the fact that carbon is an acid element (that is, gives an

not at all a strong acid and compounds of chlorine and carbon, even CCl<sub>4</sub>, are not decomposed
by water as is the case with phosphorus chloride and even silicic chloride and boric

find in the hydrogen of hydrocarbons this faculty for being substituted by metals. The
metallic compounds which correspond with hydrocarbons are known under the name of

continually quoted as cases of substitution. Thus the combination of ethylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>,
with chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, was often regarded as a formation of the products of the substitution
of C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl and HCl, which it was supposed were held together as the water of crystallisation
is in salts. Even earlier than this (1857, <i>Journal of the Petroffsky Academy</i>) I
considered similar cases as true compounds. In general, according to the law of limits,
an unsaturated hydrocarbon, or its derivative, on combining with <i>r</i>X<sub>2</sub>, gives a substance
which is saturated or else approaching the limit. The investigations of Frankland
with many organo-metallic compounds clearly showed the limit in the case of metallic
compounds, which we shall constantly refer to later on.</p></div>

in his classical work, &lsquo;Traité de Chimie Organique,&rsquo; finished in 1855 (4 vols.),
in which he divided all organic compounds into <i>fatty</i> and <i>aromatic</i>, which is in principle
still adhered to at the present time, although the latter are more often called benzene
derivatives, on account of the fact that Kekulé, in his beautiful investigations on the
structure of aromatic compounds, showed the presence in them all of the &lsquo;benzene
nucleus,&rsquo; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_472" id="Footnote_27_472"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_472"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> This is always true for hydrocarbons, but for derivatives of the lower homologues the
law is sometimes different; for instance, in the series of saturated alcohols, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+1</sub>(OH),
when <i>n</i> = 0, we obtain water, H(OH), which boils at 100°, and whose specific gravity at
15° = 0·9992; when <i>n</i> = 1, wood spirit CH<sub>3</sub>(OH), which boils at 66°, and at 15° has a
specific gravity = 0·7964; when <i>n</i> = 2, ordinary alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH), boiling at 78°, specific
gravity at 15° = 0·7936, and with further increase of CH<sub>2</sub> the specific gravity increases.
For the glycols C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> the phenomenon of a similar kind is still more striking; at
first the temperature of the boiling point and the density increase, and then for higher
(more complex) members of the series diminish. The reason for this phenomenon, it is
evident, must be sought for in the influence and properties of water, and that strong
affinity which, acting between hydrogen and oxygen, determines many of the exceptional
properties of water (Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_473" id="Footnote_28_473"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_473"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> As, for example, in the saturated series of hydrocarbons C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>, the lowest
member (<i>n</i> = 0) must be taken as hydrogen H<sub>2</sub>, a gas which (<i>t.c.</i> below -190°) is liquefied
with great difficulty, and when in a liquid state has doubtless a very small density.
Where <i>n</i> = 1, 2, 3, the hydrocarbons CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> are gases, more and more readily
liquefiable. The temperature of the absolute boiling point for CH<sub>4</sub> = -100°, and for
ethane C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, and in the higher members it rises. The hydrocarbon C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, liquefies at
about 0°. C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub> (there are several isomers) boils at from +9° (Lvoff) to 37°, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>
from 58° to 78°, &amp;c. The specific gravities in a liquid state at 15° are:&mdash;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_474" id="Footnote_29_474"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_474"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> If, at the ordinary temperature (assuming therefore that the water formed will be
in a liquid state) a gram molecule (26 grams) of acetylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, be burnt, 310 thousand
calories will be emitted (Thomsen), and as 12 grams of charcoal produce 97 thousand
calories, and 2 grams of hydrogen 69 thousand calories, it follows that, if the hydrogen
and carbon of the acetylene were burnt there would be only 2 × 97 + 69, or 263
thousand calories produced. It is evident, then, that acetylene in its formation absorbs
310&ndash;263, or 47 thousand calories.</p>

<p>For considerations relative to the combustion of carbon compounds, we will first
enumerate the quantity of heat separated by the combustion of definite chemical carbon
compounds, and then give a few figures bearing on the kinds of fuel used in practice.</p>

<p>For molecular quantities in perfect combustion the following amounts of heat are
given out (when gaseous carbonic anhydride and liquid water are formed), according to
Thomsen's data (1) for gaseous C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>: 52·8 + 158·8<i>n</i> thousand calories; (2) for
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>: 17·7 + 158·1<i>n</i> thousand calories; (3) according to Stohmann (1888) for liquid
saturated alcohols, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>O: 11·8 + 156·3<i>n</i>, and as the latent heat of evaporation = about
8·2 + 0·6<i>n</i>, in a gaseous state, 20·0 + 156·9<i>n</i>; (4) for monobasic saturated liquid acids,
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>O<sub>2</sub>:&mdash;95·3 + 154·3<i>n</i>, and as their latent heat of evaporation is about 5·0 + 1·2<i>n</i>, in a
gaseous form, about&mdash;90 + 155<i>n</i>; (5) for solid saturated bibasic acids, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>-2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>:&mdash;253·8
+ 152·6<i>n</i>, if they are expressed as C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, then 51·4 + 152·6<i>n</i>; (6) for benzene
and its liquid homologues (still according to Stohmann) C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>-6</sub>:&mdash;158·6 + 156·3<i>n</i>,
and in a gaseous form about&mdash;155 + 157<i>n</i>; (7) for the gaseous homologues of acetylene,
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>-2</sub> (according to Thomsen)&mdash;5 + 157<i>n</i>. It is evident from the preceding figures
that the group CH<sub>2</sub>, or CH<sub>3</sub> substituted for H, on burning gives out from 152 to
159 thousand calories. This is less than that given out by C + H<sub>2</sub>, which is 97 + 69 or 166
thousand; the reason for this difference (it would be still greater if carbon were gaseous)
is the amount of heat separated during the formation of CH<sub>2</sub>. According to Stohmann,
for dextroglucose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, it is 673·7; for common sugar, C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub>, 1325·7; for
cellulose, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, 678·0; starch, 677·5; dextrin, 666·2; glycol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, 281·7; glycerine,
397·2, &amp;c. The heat of combustion of the following solids (determined by Stohmann) is
expressed per unit of weight: naphthalene, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, 9,621; urea, CN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, 2,465; white of
egg, 5,579; dry rye bread, 4,421; wheaten bread, 4,302; tallow, 9,365; butter, 9,192;
linseed oil, 9,323. The most complete collection of arithmetical data for the heats of
combustion will be found in V. F. Longinin's work, &lsquo;Description of the Various Methods
of Determining the Heats of Combustion of Organic Compounds&rsquo; (Moscow, 1894).</p>

<p>The number of units of heat given out by <i>unit weight</i> during the complete combustion
and cooling of the following ordinary kinds of fuel in their usual state of dryness and
purity are:&mdash;(1) for wood charcoal, anthracite, semi-anthracite, bituminous coal and coke,
from 7,200 to 8,200; (2) dry, long flaming coals, and the best brown coals, from 6,200 to
6,800; (3) perfectly dry wood, 3,500; hardly dry, 2,500; (4) perfectly dry peat, best kind,
4,500; compressed and dried, 3,000; (5) petroleum refuse and similar liquid hydrocarbons,
about 11,000; (6) illuminating gas of the ordinary composition (about 45 vols. H, 40 vols.
CH<sub>4</sub>, 5 vols. CO, and 5 vols. N), about 12,000; (7) producer gas (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_379">next Chapter</a>), containing
2 vols. carbonic anhydride, 30 vols. carbonic oxide, and 68 vols. nitrogen <i>for one
part by weight of the whole carbon burnt</i>, 5,300, and for one part by weight of the gas,
910, units of heat; and (8) water gas (<i>see</i> <a href="#Page_379">next chapter</a>) containing 4 vols. carbonic anhydride,
8 vols. N<sub>2</sub>, 24 vols. carbonic oxide, and 46 vols. H<sub>2</sub>, for one part by weight of the
carbon consumed in the <i>generator</i> 10,900, and for one part by weight of the gas, 3,600
units of heat. In these figures, as in all calorimetric observations, the water produced
by the combustion of the fuel is supposed to be liquid. As regards the temperature
reached by the fuel, it is important to remark that for solid fuel it is indispensable to
admit (to ensure complete combustion) twice the amount of air required, but liquid, or
pulverised fuel, and especially gaseous fuel, does not require an excess of air; therefore,
a kilogram of charcoal, giving 8,000 units of heat, requires about 24 kilograms of air (3
kilograms of air per thousand calories) and a kilogram of producer gas requires only
0·77 kilogram of air (0·85 kilo. of air per 1,000 calories), 1 kilogram of water gas about
4·5 of air (1·25 kilo. of air per 1,000 calories).</p></div>

<p>Illuminating gas is generally prepared by heating gas coal (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_6_447">6</a>) in oval
cylindrical horizontal cast-iron or clay retorts. Several such retorts <i>BB</i> (fig. <a href="#fig_58">58</a>) are
disposed in the furnace <i>A</i>, and heated together. When the retorts are heated to a
red heat, lumps of coal are thrown into them, and they are then closed with a closely
fitting cover. The illustration shows the furnace, with five retorts. Coke (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_1_442">1</a>,
dry distillation) remains in the retorts, and the volatile products in the form of vapours
and gases travel along the pipe <i>d</i>, rising from each retort. These pipes branch above
the stove, and communicate with the receiver <i>f</i> (hydraulic main) placed above the furnace.
Those products of the dry distillation which most easily pass from the gaseous into the
liquid and solid states collect in the hydraulic main. From the hydraulic main the
vapours and gases travel along the pipe <i>g</i> and the series of vertical pipes <i>j</i> (which are
sometimes cooled by water trickling over the surface), where the vapours and gases cool
from the contact of the colder surface, and a fresh quantity of vapour condenses. The
condensed liquids pass from the pipes <i>g</i> and <i>j</i> and into the troughs <i>H</i>. These troughs
always contain liquid at a constant level (the excess flowing away) so that the gas cannot
escape, and thus they form, as it is termed, a hydraulic joint. In the state in which it
leaves the condensers the gas consists principally of the following vapours and gases:
(1) vapour of water, (2) ammonium carbonate, (3) liquid hydrocarbons, (4) hydrogen sulphide,
H<sub>2</sub>S, (5) carbonic anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>, (6) carbonic oxide, CO, (7) sulphurous anhydride,
SO<sub>2</sub>, but a great part of the illuminating gas consists of (8) hydrogen, (9) marsh
gas, (10) olefiant gas, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, and other gaseous hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons (3, 9, and
10), the hydrogen, and carbonic oxide are capable of combustion, and are useful component
parts, but the carbonic anhydride, the hydrogen sulphide, and sulphurous anhydride,
as well as the vapours of ammonium carbonate, form an injurious admixture,
because they do not burn (CO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>) and lower the temperature and brilliancy of the flame,
or else, although capable of burning (for example, H<sub>2</sub>S, CS<sub>2</sub>, and others), they give out
during combustion sulphurous anhydride which has a disagreeable smell, is injurious
when inhaled, and spoils many surrounding objects. In order to separate the injurious
products, the gas is washed with water, a cylinder (not shown in the illustration) filled
with coke continually moistened with water serving for this purpose. The water coming
into contact with the gas dissolves the ammonium carbonate; hydrogen sulphide, carbonic
anhydride, and sulphurous anhydride, being only partly soluble in water, have to
be got rid of by a special means. For this purpose the gas is passed through moist lime
or other alkaline liquid, as the above-mentioned gases have acid properties and are
therefore retained by the alkali. In the case of lime, calcium carbonate, sulphite and
sulphide, all solid substances, are formed. It is necessary to renew the purifying
material as its absorbing power decreases. A mixture of lime and sulphate of iron,
FeSO<sub>4</sub>, acts still better, because the latter, with lime, Ca(HO)<sub>2</sub>, forms ferrous hydroxide,
Fe(HO)<sub>2</sub> and gypsum, CaSO<sub>4</sub>. The suboxide (partly turning into oxide) of iron absorbs
H<sub>2</sub>S, forming FeS and H<sub>2</sub>O, and the gypsum retains the remainder of the ammonia,
the excess of lime absorbing carbonic anhydride and sulphuric anhydride. [In English
works a native hydrated ferric hydroxide is used for removing hydrogen sulphide.]
This purification of the gas takes place in the apparatus <i>L</i>, where the gas passes through
perforated trays <i>m</i>, covered with sawdust mixed with lime and sulphate of iron. It is
necessary to remark that in the manufacture of gas it is indispensable to draw off the
vapours from the retorts, so that they should not remain there long (otherwise the
hydrocarbons would in a considerable degree be resolved into charcoal and hydrogen),
and also to avoid a great pressure of gas in the apparatus, otherwise a quantity of gas
would escape at all cracks such as must inevitably exist in such a complicated arrangement.
For this purpose there are special pumps (exhausters) so regulated that they
only pump off the quantity of gas formed (the pump is not shown in the illustration).
The purified gas passes through the pipe <i>n</i> into the gasometer (gasholder) <i>P</i>, a dome
made of iron plate. The edges of the dome dip into water poured into a ring-shaped
channel <i>g</i>, in which the sides of the dome rise and fall. The gas is collected in this
holder, and distributed to its destination by pipes communicating with the pipe <i>o</i>, issuing
from the dome. The pressure of the dome on the gas
enables it, on issuing from a long pipe, to penetrate
through the small aperture of the burner. A hundred
kilograms of coal give about 20 to 30 cubic metres of gas,
having a density from four to nine times greater than that
of hydrogen. A cubic metre (1,000 litres) of hydrogen
weighs about 87 grams; therefore 100 kilograms of coal
give about 18 kilograms of gas, or about one-sixth of its
weight. Illuminating gas is generally lighter than marsh
gas, as it contains a considerable amount of hydrogen, and
is only heavier than marsh gas when it contains much of
the heavier hydrocarbons. Thus olefiant gas, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, is
fourteen times, and the vapours of benzene thirty-nine
times, heavier than hydrogen, and illuminating gas sometimes
contains 15 p.c. of its volume of them. The brilliancy
of the flame of the gas increases with the quantity of
olefiant gas and similar heavy hydrocarbons, as it then
contains more carbon for a given volume and a greater
number of carbon particles are separated. Gas usually
contains from 35 to 60 p.c. of its volume of marsh gas, from
30 to 50 p.c. of hydrogen, from 3 to 5 p.c. of carbonic oxide,
from 2 to 10 p.c. heavy hydrocarbons, and from 3 to 10 p.c.
of nitrogen. Wood gives almost the same sort of gas as
coal and almost the same quantity, but the wood gas contains
a great deal of carbonic anhydride, although on the
other hand there is an almost complete absence of sulphur
compounds. Tar, oils, naphtha, and such materials
furnish a large quantity of good illuminating gas. An
ordinary burner of 8 to 12 candle-power burns 5 to 6 cubic
feet of coal gas per hour, but only 1 cubic foot of naphtha
gas. One pood (36 lbs. Eng.) of naphtha gives 500 cubic
feet of gas&mdash;that is, one kilogram of naphtha produces about
one cubic metre of gas. The formation of combustible gas
by heating coal was discovered in the beginning of the last
century, but only put into practice towards the end by Le-Bon in France and Murdoch
in England. In England, Murdoch, together with the renowned Watt, built the first
gas works in 1805.</p>

<p>In practice illuminating gas is not only used for lighting (electricity and kerosene are
cheaper in Russia), but also as the motive power for gas engines (<i>see</i> p. <a href="#Page_175">175</a>), which consume
about half a cubic metre per horse-power per hour; gas is also used in laboratories
for heating purposes. When it is necessary to concentrate the heat, either the ordinary
blowpipe (fig. <a href="#fig_59">59</a>) is applied, placing the end in the flame and blowing through the mouthpiece;
or, in other forms, gas is passed through the blowpipe; when a large, hot, smokeless
flame is required for heating crucibles or glass-blowing, a foot-blower is used. High
temperatures, which are often required for laboratory and manufacturing purposes, are
most easily attained by the use of gaseous fuel (illuminating gas, producer gas, and
water gas, which will be treated of in the <a href="#Page_379">following chapter</a>), because complete combustion
may be effected without an access of air. It is
evident that in order to obtain high temperatures
means must be taken to diminish the loss of heat
by radiation, and to ensure perfect combustion.</p></div>

are not described in this work, because they are dealt with in organic chemistry, yet in
order to clearly show the mechanism of those transformations by which the carbon
atoms are built up into the molecules of the carbon compounds, we here give a general
example of reactions of this kind. From marsh gas, CH<sub>4</sub>, on the one hand the substitution
of chlorine or iodine, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, CH<sub>3</sub>I, for the hydrogen may be effected, and on the
other hand such metals as sodium may be substituted for the hydrogen, <i>e.g.</i> CH<sub>3</sub>Na.
These and similar products of substitution serve as a means of obtaining other more
complex substances from given carbon compounds. If we place the two above-named
products of substitution of marsh gas (metallic and haloid) in mutual contact, the metal
combines with the halogen, forming a very stable compound&mdash;namely, common salt,
NaCl, and the carbon groups which were in combination with them separate in mutual
combination, as shown by the equation:</p>

<p class="title">CH<sub>3</sub>Cl + CH<sub>3</sub>Na = NaCl + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.</p>

<p>This is the most simple example of the formation of a complex hydrocarbon from these
radicles. The cause of the reaction must be sought for in the property which the haloid
(chlorine) and sodium have of entering into mutual combination.</p></div>

those unions and correlations which their atoms have in the molecules&mdash;was for a long
time limited to the representation that organic substances contained complex radicles
(for instance, ethyl C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, methyl CH<sub>3</sub>, phenyl C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, &amp;c.); then about the year 1840 the
phenomena of substitution and the correspondence of the products of substitution with the
primary bodies (nuclei and types) were observed, but it was not until about the year
1860 and later when on the one hand the teaching of Gerhardt about molecules was
spreading, and on the other hand the materials had accumulated for discussing the
transformations of the simplest hydrocarbon compounds, that conjectures began to
appear as to the mutual connection of the atoms of carbon in the molecules of the complex
hydrocarbon compounds. Then Kekulé and A. M. Butleroff began to formulate the
connection between the separate atoms of carbon, regarding it as a quadrivalent element.
Although in their methods of expression and in some of their views they differ from each
other and also from the way in which the subject is treated in this work, yet the essence
of the matter&mdash;namely, the comprehension of the causes of isomerism and of the union
between the separate atoms of carbon&mdash;remains the same. In addition to this, starting
from the year 1870, there appears a tendency which from year to year increases to discover
the actual spacial distribution of the atoms in the molecules. Thanks to the
endeavours of Le-Bel (1874), Van't Hoff (1874), and Wislicenus (1887) in observing cases
of isomerism&mdash;such as the effect of different isomerides on the direction of the rotation
of the plane of polarisation of light&mdash;this tendency promises much for chemical mechanics,
but the details of the still imperfect knowledge in relation to this matter must be sought
for in special works devoted to organic chemistry.</p></div>

<p>This was shown in the year 1860, or thereabout, by many methods, and is the fundamental
conception of the structure of hydrocarbon compounds. If the atoms of hydrogen
in methyl were not absolutely identical in value and position (as they are not, for instance,
in CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> or CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>X), then there would be as many different forms of CH<sub>3</sub>X

hydrocarbon derivatives. (1) the alcohols. These are hydrocarbons in which
hydrogen is exchanged for hydroxyl (OH). The simplest of these is methyl alcohol,
CH<sub>3</sub>(OH), or wood spirit obtained by the dry distillation of wood. The common spirits
of wine or ethyl alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(OH), and glycol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, correspond with ethane.
Normal propyl alcohol, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>(OH), and isopropyl alcohol, CH<sub>3</sub>CH(OH)CH<sub>3</sub>, propylene-glycol,
C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and glycerol, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub> (which, with stearic and other acids,
forms fatty substances), correspond with propane, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>. All alcohols are capable of forming
water and ethereal salts with acids, just as alkalis form ordinary salts. (2) Aldehydes
are alcohols minus hydrogen; for instance, acetaldehyde, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, corresponds with ethyl
alcohol. (3) It is simplest to regard organic acids as hydrocarbons in which hydrogen
has been exchanged for carboxyl (CO<sub>2</sub>H), as will be explained in the <a href="#Page_379">following chapter</a>.
There are a number of intermediate compounds; for example, the aldehyde-alcohols,
alcohol-acids (or hydroxy-acids), &amp;c. Thus the hydroxy-acids are hydrocarbons in which
some of the hydrogen has been replaced by hydroxyl, and some by carboxyl; for
instance, lactic acid corresponds with C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, and has the constitution C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)(CO<sub>2</sub>H).
If to these products we add the haloid salts (where H is replaced by Cl, Br, I), the nitro-compounds
containing NO<sub>2</sub> in place of H, the amides, cyanides, ketones, and other compounds,
it will be readily seen what an immense number of organic compounds there are
and what a variety of properties these substances have; this we see also from the composition
of plants and animals.</p></div>

double its volume when hydrogen and carbon are formed, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> = CH<sub>4</sub> + C = 2C + 2H<sub>2</sub>.
A mixture of olefiant gas and oxygen is highly explosive; two volumes of this gas require
six volumes of oxygen for its perfect combustion. The eight volumes thus taken then
resolve themselves into eight volumes of the products of combustion, a mixture of water
and carbonic anhydride, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + 3O<sub>2</sub> = 2CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. On cooling after the explosion
diminution of volume occurs because the water becomes liquid. For two volumes of the
olefiant gas taken, the diminution will be equal to four volumes, and the same for marsh
gas. The quantity of carbonic anhydride formed by both gases is not the same. Two
volumes of marsh gas give only two volumes of carbonic anhydride, and two volumes of
ethylene give four volumes of carbonic anhydride.</p></div>

its more volatile parts; in Baku naphtha the hydrocarbons of the composition C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub> form
the main part (Lisenko, Markovnikoff, Beilstein) but doubtless (Mendeléeff) it also contains
saturated ones, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>. The structure of the naphtha hydrocarbons is only known
for the lower homologues, but doubtless the distinction between the hydrocarbons of the
Pennsylvanian and Baku naphthas, boiling at the same temperature (after the requisite
refining by repeated fractional distillation, which can be very conveniently done by
means of steam rectification&mdash;that is, by passing the steam through the dense
mass), depends not only on the predominance of saturated hydrocarbons in the
former, and naphthenes, C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i></sub>, in the latter, but also on the diversity of composition and
structure of the corresponding portions of the distillation. The products of the Baku
naphtha are richer in carbon (therefore in a suitably constructed lamp they ought to give
a brighter light), they are of greater specific gravity, and have greater internal friction
(and are therefore more suitable for lubricating machinery) than the American products
collected at the same temperature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_499" id="Footnote_52_499"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_499"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> The formation of naphtha fountains (which burst forth after the higher clay strata
covering the layers of sands impregnated with naphtha have been bored through) is without
doubt caused by the pressure or tension of the combustible hydrocarbon gases
which accompany the naphtha, and are soluble in it under pressure. Sometimes these
naphtha fountains reach a height of 100 metres&mdash;for instance, the fountain of 1887 near
Baku. Naphtha fountains generally act periodically and their force diminishes with the
lapse of time, which might be expected, because the gases which cause the fountains find
an outlet, as the naphtha issuing from the bore-hole carries away the sand which was
partially choking it up.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_500" id="Footnote_53_500"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_500"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> This is a so-called intermediate oil (between kerosene and lubricating oils), solar oil,
or pyronaphtha. Lamps are already being manufactured for burning it but still require
improvement. Above all, however, it requires a more extended market, and this at
present is wanting, owing to the two following reasons: (1) Those products of the American
petroleum which are the most widely spread and almost universally consumed contain
but little of this intermediate oil, and what there is is divided between the kerosene
and the lubricating oils; (2) the Baku naphtha, which is capable of yielding a great
deal (up to 30 p.c.) of intermediate oil, is produced in enormous quantities, about
300 million poods, but has no regular markets abroad, and for the consumption in
Russia (about 25 million poods of kerosene per annum) and for the limited export
(60 million poods per annum) into Western Europe (by the Trans-Caucasian Railway)
those volatile and more dangerous parts of the naphtha which enter into the composition
of the American petroleum are sufficient, although Baku naphtha yields about 25 p.c. of
such kerosene. For this reason pyronaphtha is not manufactured in sufficient quantities,
and the whole world is consuming the unsafe kerosene. When a pipe line has been laid
from Baku to the Black Sea (in America there are many which carry the raw naphtha to
the sea-shore, where it is made into kerosene and other products) then the whole mass of
the Baku naphtha will furnish safe illuminating oils, which without doubt will find an
immense application. A mixture of the intermediate oil with kerosene or Baku oil (specific
gravity 0·84 to 0·85) may be considered (on removing the benzoline) to be the best
illuminating oil, because it is safe (flashing point from 40° to 60°), cheaper (Baku naphtha
gives as much as 60 p.c. of Baku oil), and burns perfectly well in lamps differing
but little from those made for burning American kerosene (unsafe, flashing point
20° to 30°).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_501" id="Footnote_54_501"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_501"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> The substitution of Baku pyronaphtha, or intermediate oil, or Baku oil (<i>see</i> Note
<a href="#Footnote_53_500">53</a>), would not only be a great advantage as regards safety from fire, but would also
be highly economical. A ton (62 poods) of American crude petroleum costs at the
coast considerably more than 24<i>s.</i> (12 roubles), and yields two-thirds of a ton of
kerosene suitable for ordinary lamps. A ton of raw naphtha in Baku costs less than
4<i>s.</i> (1 rouble 80 copecks), and with a pipe line to the shore of the Black Sea would not
cost more than 8 roubles, or 16<i>s.</i> Moreover, a ton of Baku naphtha will yield as much as
two-thirds of a ton of kerosene, Baku oil, and pyronaphtha suitable for illuminating
purposes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_502" id="Footnote_55_502"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_502"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> Naphtha has been applied for heating purposes on a large scale in Russia, not only
on account of the low cost of naphtha itself and of the residue from the preparation of
kerosene, but also because the products of all the Baku naphtha do not find an outlet
for general consumption. Naphtha itself and its various residues form excellent fuel,
burning without smoke and giving a high temperature (steel and iron may be easily
melted in the flame). A hundred poods of good coal (for instance, Don coal) used as
fuel for heating boilers are equivalent to 36 cubic feet (about 250 poods) of dry wood,
while only 70 poods of naphtha will be required; and moreover there is no need for
stoking, as the liquid can be readily and evenly supplied in the required quantity. The
economic and other questions relating to American and Baku petroleums have been
discussed more in detail in some separate works of mine (D. Mendeléeff): (1) &lsquo;The
Naphtha Industry of Pennsylvania and the Caucasus,&rsquo; 1870; (2) &lsquo;Where to Build
Naphtha Works,&rsquo; 1880; (3) &lsquo;On the Naphtha Question,&rsquo; 1883; (4) &lsquo;The Baku Naphtha
Question,&rsquo; 1886; (5) the article on the naphtha industry in the account of the Russian
industries printed for the Chicago Exhibition.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_56_503" id="Footnote_56_503"></a><a href="#FNanchor_56_503"><span class="label">[56]</span></a> As during the process of the dry distillation of wood, sea-weed, and similar vegetable
<i>débris</i>, and also when fats are decomposed by the action of heat (in closed vessels),
hydrocarbons similar to those of naphtha are formed, it was natural that this fact should
have been turned to account to explain the formation of the latter. But the hypothesis
of the formation of naphtha from vegetable <i>débris</i> inevitably assumes coal to be the
chief element of decomposition, and naphtha is met with in Pennsylvania and Canada, in
the Silurian and Devonian strata, which do not contain coal, and correspond to an epoch
not abounding in organic matter. Coal was formed from the vegetable <i>débris</i> of the
Carboniferous, Jurassic, and other recent strata, but judging more from its composition
and structure, it has been subjected to the same kind of decomposition as peat; nor
could liquid hydrocarbons have been thus formed to such an extent as we see in naphtha.
If we ascribe the derivation of naphtha to the decomposition of fat (adipose, animal fat)
we encounter three almost insuperable difficulties: (1) Animal remains would furnish
a great deal of nitrogenous matter, whilst there is but very little in naphtha; (2) the
enormous quantity of naphtha already discovered as compared with the insignificant
amount of fat in the animal carcase; (3) the sources of naphtha always running parallel
to mountain chains is completely inexplicable. Being struck with this last-mentioned
circumstance in Pennsylvania, and finding that the sources in the Caucasus surround the
whole Caucasian range (Baku, Tiflis, Gouria, Kouban, Tamman, Groznoe, Dagestan), I
developed in 1876 the hypothesis of the mineral origin of naphtha expounded further on.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_57_504" id="Footnote_57_504"></a><a href="#FNanchor_57_504"><span class="label">[57]</span></a> During the upheaval of mountain ranges crevasses would be formed at the peaks
with openings upwards, and at the foot of the mountains with openings downwards.
These cracks in course of time fill up, but the younger the mountains the fresher the
cracks (the Alleghany mountains are, without doubt, more ancient than the Caucasian,
which were formed during the tertiary epoch); through them water must gain access
deep into the recesses of the earth to an extent that could not occur on the level (on
plains). The situation of naphtha at the foot of mountain chains is the principal
argument in my hypothesis.</p>

<p>Another fundamental reason is the consideration of the mean density of the earth.
Cavendish, Airy, Cornu, Boys, and many others who have investigated the subject by
various methods, found that, taking water = 1, the mean density of the earth is nearly
5·5. As at the surface water and all rocks (sand, clay, limestone, granite, &amp;c.) have a
density less than 3, it is evident (as solid substances are but slightly compressible even
under the greatest pressure) that inside the earth there are substances of a greater density&mdash;indeed,
not less than 7 or 8. What conclusion, then, can be arrived at? Anything
heavy contained in the bosom of the earth must be distributed not only on its surface,
but throughout the whole solar system, for everything tends to show that the sun and
planets are formed from the same material, and according to the hypothesis of Laplace
and Kant it is most probable, and indeed must necessarily be held, that the earth and
planets are but fragments of the solar atmosphere, which have had time to cool considerably
and become masses semi-liquid inside and solid outside, forming both planets
and satellites. The sun amongst other heavy elements contains a great deal of iron,
as shown by spectrum analysis. There is also much of it in an oxidised condition on
the surface of the earth. Meteoric stones, carried as fragmentary planets in the solar
system and sometimes falling upon the earth, consisting of siliceous rocks similar to terrestrial
ones, often contain either dense masses of iron (for example, the Pallosovo iron
preserved in the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences) or granular masses (for instance,
the Okhansk meteorite of 1886). It is therefore possible that the interior of the earth
contains much iron in a metallic state. This might be anticipated from the hypothesis
of Laplace, for the iron must have been compressed into a liquid at that period when
the other component parts of the earth were still strongly heated, and oxides of iron
could not then have been formed. The iron was covered with slags (mixtures of silicates
like glass fused with rocky matter) which did not allow it to burn at the expense of the
oxygen of the atmosphere or of water, just at that time when the temperature of the
earth was very high. Carbon was in the same state; its oxides were also capable of
dissociation (Deville); it is also but slightly volatile, and has an affinity for iron, and iron
carbide is found in meteoric stones (as well as carbon and even the diamond). Thus the
supposition of the existence of iron carbides in the interior of the earth was derived by
me from many indications, which are to some extent confirmed by the fact that granular
pieces of iron have been found in some basalts (ancient lava) as well as in meteoric stones.
The occurrence of iron in contact with carbon during the formation of the earth is all
the more probable because those elements predominate in nature which have small
atomic weights, and among them the most widely diffused, the most difficultly fusible,
and therefore the most easily condensed (Chapter XV.) are carbon and iron. They
passed into the liquid state when all compounds were at a temperature of dissociation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_507" id="Footnote_60_507"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_507"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> Probably naphtha was produced during the upheaval of all mountain chains, but
only in some cases were the conditions favourable to its being preserved underground.
The water penetrating below formed there a mixture of naphtha and watery vapours,
and this mixture issued through fissures to the cold parts of the earth's crust. The
naphtha vapours, on condensing, formed naphtha, which, if there were no obstacles,
appeared on the surface of land and water. Here part of it soaked through formations
(possibly the bituminous slates, schists, dolomites, &amp;c., were thus formed), another part
was carried away on the water, became oxidised, evaporated, and was driven to the
shores (the Caucasian naphtha probably in this way, during the existence of the Aralo-Caspian
sea, was carried as far as the Sisran banks of the Volga, where many strata are
impregnated with naphtha and products of its oxidation resembling asphalt and pitch);
a great part of it was burnt in one way or another&mdash;that is, gave carbonic anhydride and
water. If the mixture of vapours, water, and naphtha formed inside the earth had no
free outlet to the surface, it nevertheless would find its way through fissures to the
superior and colder strata, and there become condensed. Some of the formations (clays)
which do not absorb naphtha were only washed away by the warm water, and formed
mud, which we also now observe issuing from the earth in the form of mud volcanoes.
The neighbourhood of Baku and the whole of the Caucasus near the naphtha districts
are full of such volcanoes, which from time to time are in a state of eruption. In
old naphtha beds (such as the Pennsylvanian) even these blow-holes are closed, and
the mud volcanoes have had time to be washed away. The naphtha and the gaseous
hydrocarbons formed with it under the pressure of the overlying earth and water impregnated
the layers of sand, which are capable of absorbing a great quantity of such
liquid, and if above this there were strata impermeable to naphtha (dense, clayey, damp
strata) the naphtha would accumulate in them. It is thus preserved from remote geological
periods up to the present day, compressed and dissolved under the pressure of
the gases which burst out in places forming naphtha fountains. If this be granted, it
may be thought that in the comparatively new (geologically speaking) mountain chains,
such as the Caucasian, naphtha is even now being formed. Such a supposition may
explain the remarkable fact that, in Pennsylvania, localities where naphtha had been
rapidly worked for five years have become exhausted, and it becomes necessary to constantly
have recourse to sinking new wells in fresh places. Thus, from the year 1859,
the workings were gradually transferred along a line running parallel to the Alleghany
mountains for a distance of more than 200 miles, whilst in Baku the industry dates
from time immemorial (the Persians worked near the village of Ballaghana) and up to the
present time keeps to one and the same place. The amounts of the Pennsylvanian and
Baku annual outputs are at present equal&mdash;namely, about 250 million poods (4 million
tons). It may be that the Baku beds, as being of more recent geological formation, are
not so exhausted by nature as those of Pennsylvania, and perhaps in the neighbourhood
of Baku naphtha is still being formed, which is partially indicated by the continued
activity of the mud volcanoes. As many varieties of naphtha contain in solution solid
slightly volatile hydrocarbons like paraffin and mineral wax, the production of ozocerite,
or mountain wax, is accounted for in conjunction with the formation of naphtha.
Ozocerite is found in Galicia, also in the neighbourhood of Novorossisk, in the Caucasus,
and on the islands of the Caspian Sea (particularly in the Chileken and Holy Islands);
it is met with in large masses, and is used for the production of paraffin and <i>ceresene</i>,
for the manufacture of candles, and similar purposes.</p>

<p>As the naphtha treasures of the Caucasus have hardly been exploited (near Baku and
near Kouban and Grosnyi), and as naphtha finds numerous uses, the subject presents
most interesting features to chemists and geologists, and is worthy of the close attention
of practical men.</p></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 61.&mdash;Dumas and Stas' apparatus for determining the composition of carbonic anhydride.
Carbon, graphite, or a diamond is placed in the tube E in the furnace, and heated in a stream of
oxygen displaced from the bottle by water flowing from A. The oxygen is purified from carbonic
anhydride and water in the tubes B, C, D. Carbonic anhydride, together with a certain amount
of carbon monoxide, is formed in E. The latter is converted into carbonic acid by passing the
products of combustion through a tube F, containing cupric oxide heated in a furnace. The cupric
oxide oxidises this CO into CO<sub>2</sub>, forming metallic copper. The potash bulbs H and tubes I, J, K
retain the carbonic anhydride. Thus, knowing the weight of carbon taken and the weight of
the resultant carbonic anhydride (by weighing H, I, J, K before and after the experiment), the
composition of carbonic anhydride and the equivalent of carbon may be determined.</p></div>

<p>Carbonic anhydride (or carbonic acid or carbon dioxide, CO<sub>2</sub>) was the
first of all gases distinguished from atmospheric air. Paracelsus and
Van Helmont, in the sixteenth century, knew that on heating limestone
a particular gas separated, which is also formed during the alcoholic
fermentation of saccharine solutions (for instance, in the manufacture
of wine); they knew that it was identical with the gas which is produced
by the combustion of charcoal, and that in some cases it is found
in nature. In course of time it was found that this gas is absorbed by
alkali, forming a salt which, under the action of acid, again yields this
same gas. Priestley found that this gas exists in air, and Lavoisier
determined its formation during respiration, combustion, putrefaction,
and during the reduction of the oxides of metals by charcoal; he determined
its composition, and showed that it only contains oxygen and
carbon. Berzelius, Dumas with Stas, and Roscoe, determined its composition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
showing that it contains twelve parts of carbon to thirty-two of
oxygen. The composition by volume of this gas is determined from the
fact that during the combustion of charcoal in oxygen, the volume remains
unchanged; that is to say, <i>carbonic anhydride occupies the same volume
as the oxygen which it contains</i>&mdash;that is, the atoms of the carbon are,
so to speak, squeezed in between the atoms of the oxygen. O<sub>2</sub> occupies
two volumes and is a molecule of ordinary oxygen; CO<sub>2</sub> likewise
occupies two volumes, and expresses the composition and molecular
weight of the gas. Carbonic anhydride exists <i>in nature</i>, both in a free
state and in the most varied compounds. In a free state it is always
contained (Chapter <a href="#Page_223">V</a>.) in the air, and in solution is in all kinds of
water. It is evolved from volcanoes, from mountain fissures, and in
some caves. The well-known Dog grotto, near Agnano on the bay of
Baiæ, near Naples, furnishes the best known example of such an evolution.
Similar sources of carbonic anhydride are also found in other places.
In France, for instance, there is a well-known poisonous fountain in
Auvergne. It is a round hole, surrounded with luxurious vegetation
and constantly evolving carbonic anhydride. In the woods surrounding
the Lacher See near the Rhine, in the neighbourhood of extinct volcanoes,
there is a depression constantly filled with this same gas. The
insects which fly to this place perish, animals being unable to breathe
this gas. The birds chasing the insects also die, and this is turned to
profit by the local peasantry. Many mineral springs carry into the air
enormous quantities of this gas. Vichy in France, Sprüdel in Germany,
and Narzan in Russia (in Kislovodsk near Piatigorsk) are known for
their carbonated gaseous waters. Much of this gas is also evolved in
mines, cellars, diggings, and wells. People descending into such places
are suffocated. The combustion, putrefaction, and fermentation of
organic substances give rise to the formation of carbonic anhydride.
It is also introduced into the atmosphere during the respiration of
animals at all times and during the respiration of plants in darkness
and also during their growth. Very simple experiments prove the
formation of carbonic anhydride under these circumstances; thus, for
example, if the air expelled from the lungs be passed through a glass
tube into a transparent solution of lime (or baryta) in water a white
precipitate will soon be formed consisting of an insoluble compound of
lime and carbonic anhydride. By allowing the seeds of plants to grow
under a bell jar, or in a closed vessel, the formation of carbonic anhydride
may be similarly confirmed. By confining an animal, a mouse, for
instance, under a bell jar, the quantity of carbonic acid which it evolves
may be exactly determined, and it will he found to be many grams per
day for a mouse. Such experiments on the respiration of animals have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
been also made with great exactitude with large animals, such as men,
bulls, sheep, &amp;c. By means of enormous hermetically closed bell
receivers and the analysis of the gases evolved during respiration it was
found that a man expels about 900 grams (more than two pounds) of
carbonic anhydride per diem, and absorbs during this time 700 grams of
oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_1_508" id="FNanchor_1_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_508" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> It must be remarked that the carbonic anhydride of the air
constitutes the fundamental food of plants (Chapters <a href="#Page_152">III</a>., <a href="#Page_223">V</a>., and <a href="#Page_338">VIII</a>.)
Carbonic anhydride in a state of combination with a variety of other
substances is perhaps even more widely distributed in nature than in a
free state. Some of these substances are very stable and form a large
portion of the earth's crust. For instance, limestones, calcium carbonate,
CaCO<sub>3</sub>, were formed as precipitates in the seas existing previously on
the earth; this is proved by their stratified structure and the number
of remains of sea animals which they frequently contain. Chalk,
lithographic stone, limestone, marls (a mixture of limestone and clay),
and many other rocks are examples of such sedimentary formations.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
Carbonates with various other bases&mdash;such as, for instance, magnesia,
ferrous oxide, zinc oxide, &amp;c.&mdash;are often found in nature. The shells of
molluscs also have the composition CaCO<sub>3</sub> and many limestones were
exclusively formed from the shells of minute organisms. As carbonic
anhydride (together with water) is produced during the combustion of
all organic compounds in a stream of oxygen or by heating them with
substances which readily part with their oxygen&mdash;for instance, with
copper oxide&mdash;this method is employed for estimating the amount of
carbon in organic compounds, more especially as the CO<sub>2</sub> can be easily
collected and the amount of carbon calculated from its weight. For
this purpose a hard glass tube, closed at one end, is filled with a
mixture of the organic substance (about 0·2 gram) and copper oxide.
The open end of the tube is fitted with a cork and tube containing
calcium chloride for absorbing the water formed by the oxidation of
the substance. This tube is hermetically connected (by a caoutchouc
tube) with potash bulbs or other weighing apparatus (Chapter <a href="#Page_223">V</a>.) containing
alkali destined to absorb the carbonic anhydride. The increase
in weight of this apparatus shows the amounts of carbonic anhydride
formed during the combustion of the given substance, and the quantity
of carbon may be determined from this, because three parts of carbon
give eleven parts of carbonic anhydride.</p>

<p><i>For the preparation of carbonic anhydride</i> in laboratories and often
in manufactories, various kinds of calcium carbonate are used, being
treated with some acid; it is, however, most usual to employ the so-called
muriatic acid&mdash;that is, an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid,
HCl&mdash;because, in the first place, the substance formed, calcium
chloride. CaCl<sub>2</sub>, is soluble in water and does not hinder the further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
action of the acid on the calcium carbonate, and secondly because, as
we shall see further on, muriatic acid is a common product of chemical
works and one of the cheapest. For calcium carbonate, either limestone,
chalk, or marble is used.<a name="FNanchor_2_509" id="FNanchor_2_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_509" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="title">CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2HCl = CaCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The nature of the reaction in this case is the same as in the decomposition
of nitre by sulphuric acid; only in the latter case a hydrate is
formed, and in the former an anhydride of the acid, because the
hydrate, carbonic acid, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is unstable and as soon as it separates
decomposes into water and its own anhydride. It is evident from the
explanation of the cause of the action of sulphuric acid on nitre that
not every acid can be employed for obtaining carbonic anhydride;
namely, those will not set it free which chemically are but slightly
energetic, or those which are insoluble in water, or are themselves as
volatile as carbonic anhydride.<a name="FNanchor_3_510" id="FNanchor_3_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_510" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> But as many acids are soluble in
water and are less volatile than carbonic anhydride, the latter is
evolved by the action of most acids on its salts, and this reaction takes
place at ordinary temperatures.<a name="FNanchor_4_511" id="FNanchor_4_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_511" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span></p>

<p>For the preparation of carbonic anhydride in laboratories, marble is
generally used. It is placed in a Woulfe's bottle and treated with hydrochloric
acid in an apparatus similar to the one used for the production
of hydrogen. The gas evolved carries away through the tube part of
the volatile hydrochloric acid, and it is therefore necessary to wash the
gas by passing it through another Woulfe's bottle containing water. If
it be necessary to obtain dry carbonic anhydride, it must be passed
through chloride of calcium.<a name="FNanchor_5_512" id="FNanchor_5_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_512" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Carbonic anhydride may also be prepared by heating many of the
salts of carbonic acid; for instance, by heating magnesium carbonate,
MgCO<sub>3</sub> (<i>e.g.</i>, in the form of dolomite), the separation is easily effected,
particularly in the presence of the vapours of water. The acid salts
of carbonic acid (for instance, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, see further on) readily and
abundantly give carbonic anhydride when heated.</p>

<p>Carbonic anhydride is colourless, has a slight smell and a faint
acid taste; its density in a gaseous state is twenty-two times as great
as that of hydrogen, because its molecular weight is forty-four.<a name="FNanchor_6_513" id="FNanchor_6_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_513" class="fnanchor">[6]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
It is an example of those gaseous substances which have been
long ago transformed into all the three states. In order to obtain
liquid carbonic anhydride, the gas must be submitted to a pressure
of thirty-six atmospheres at 0°.<a name="FNanchor_7_514" id="FNanchor_7_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_514" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Its absolute boiling point
= +32°.<a name="FNanchor_8_515" id="FNanchor_8_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_515" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Liquid carbonic anhydride is colourless, does not mix with
water, but is soluble in alcohol, ether, and oils; at 0° its specific gravity
is 0·83.<a name="FNanchor_8_BIS_516" id="FNanchor_8_BIS_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_BIS_516" class="fnanchor">[8 bis]</a> The boiling point of this liquid lies at -80°&mdash;that is
to say, the pressure of carbonic acid gas at that temperature does
not exceed that of the atmosphere. At the ordinary temperature the
liquid remains as such for some time under ordinary pressure, on
account of its requiring a considerable amount of heat for its
evaporation. If the evaporation takes place rapidly, especially if the
liquid issues in a stream, such a decrease of temperature occurs that
a part of the carbonic anhydride is transformed into a solid snowy
mass. Water, mercury, and many other liquids freeze on coming into
contact with snow-like carbonic anhydride.<a name="FNanchor_9_517" id="FNanchor_9_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_517" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> In this form carbonic
anhydride may be preserved for a long time in the open air, because it
requires still more heat to turn it into a gas than when in a liquid
state.<a name="FNanchor_9_BIS_518" id="FNanchor_9_BIS_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_BIS_518" class="fnanchor">[9 bis]</a></p>

<p>The capacity which carbonic anhydride has of being liquefied stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
in connection with its <i>considerable solubility in water</i>, alcohol, and
other liquids. Its solubility in water has been already spoken of in
the <a href="#Page_40">first chapter</a>. Carbonic anhydride is still more soluble in alcohol
than in water, namely at 0° one volume of alcohol dissolves 4·3 volumes
of this gas, and at 20° 2·9 volumes.</p>

<p>Aqueous solutions of carbonic anhydride, under a pressure of several
atmospheres, are now prepared artificially, because water saturated
with this gas promotes digestion and quenches thirst. For this purpose
the carbonic anhydride is pumped by means of a force-pump into
a closed vessel containing the liquid, and then bottled off, taking
special means to ensure rapid and air-tight corking. Various effervescing
drinks and artificially effervescing wines are thus prepared.
The presence of carbonic anhydride has an important significance
in nature, because by its means water acquires the property of
decomposing and dissolving many substances which are not acted on
by pure water; for instance, calcium phosphates and carbonates are
soluble in water containing carbonic acid. If the water in the
interior of the earth is saturated with carbonic acid under pressure,
the quantity of calcium carbonate in solution may reach three grams
per litre, and on issuing at the surface, as the carbonic anhydride
escapes, the calcium carbonate will be deposited.<a name="FNanchor_10_519" id="FNanchor_10_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_519" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Water charged
with carbonic anhydride brings about the destruction of many rocky
formations by removing the lime, alkali, &amp;c., from them. This process
has been going on and continues on an enormous scale. Rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
contain silica and the oxides of various metals; amongst others,
the oxides of aluminium, calcium, and sodium. Water charged
with carbonic acid dissolves both the latter, transforming them into
carbonates. The waters of the ocean ought, as the evolution of the
carbonic anhydride proceeds, to precipitate salts of lime; these are
actually found everywhere on the surface of the ground in those places
which previously formed the bed of the ocean. The presence of carbonic
anhydride in solution in water is essential to the nourishment
and growth of water plants.</p>

<p>Although carbonic anhydride is soluble in water, yet no definite
hydrate is formed;<a name="FNanchor_11_520" id="FNanchor_11_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_520" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> nevertheless an idea of the composition of this
hydrate may be formed from that of the salts of carbonic acid, because
a hydrate is nothing but a salt in which the metal is replaced by
hydrogen. As carbonic anhydride forms salts of the composition
K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, HNaCO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c., therefore carbonic acid ought to have
the composition H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;that is, it ought to contain CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O.
Whenever this substance is formed, it decomposes into its component
parts&mdash;that is, into water and carbonic anhydride. <i>The acid properties</i>
of carbonic anhydride<a name="FNanchor_11_BIS_521" id="FNanchor_11_BIS_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_521" class="fnanchor">[11 bis]</a> are demonstrated by its being directly absorbed
by alkaline solutions and forming salts with them. In distinction
from nitric, HNO<sub>3</sub>, and similar monobasic acids which with univalent
metals (exchanging one atom for one atom of hydrogen) give salts such
as those of potassium, sodium, and silver containing only one atom of the
metal (NaNO<sub>3</sub>, AgNO<sub>3</sub>), and with bivalent<a name="FNanchor_12_522" id="FNanchor_12_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_522" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> metals (such as calcium,
barium, lead) salts containing two acid groups&mdash;for example, Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>&mdash;carbonic acid, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, <i>is bibasic</i>, that is contains two atoms
of hydrogen in the hydrate or two atoms of univalent metals in their
salts: for example, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> is washing soda, a normal salt; NaHCO<sub>3</sub> is
the bicarbonate, an acid salt. Therefore, if M&#8242; be a univalent metal,
its carbonates in general are the normal carbonate M&#8242;<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
acid carbonate, M&#8242;HCO<sub>3</sub>; or if M&#8243; be a bivalent metal (replacing H<sub>2</sub>) its
normal carbonate will be M&#8243;CO<sub>3</sub>; these metals do not usually form acid
salts, as we shall see further on. The bibasic character of carbonic acid
is akin to that of sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_13_523" id="FNanchor_13_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_523" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but the latter, in distinction
from the former, is an example of the energetic or strong acids (such as
nitric or hydrochloric), whilst in carbonic acid we observe but feeble
development of the acid properties; hence carbonic acid must be considered
<i>a weak acid</i>. This conception must, however, be taken as only
comparative, as up to this time there is no definitely established rule for
measuring the energy<a name="FNanchor_14_524" id="FNanchor_14_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_524" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of acids. The feeble acid properties of carbonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
acid may, however, be judged from the joint evidence of many properties.
With such energetic alkalis as soda and potash, carbonic acid forms
normal salts, soluble in water, but having an alkaline reaction and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
many cases themselves acting as alkalis.<a name="FNanchor_15_525" id="FNanchor_15_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_525" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The acid salts of these alkalis,
NaHCO<sub>3</sub> and KHCO<sub>3</sub>, have a neutral reaction on litmus, although they,
like acids, contain hydrogen, which may be exchanged for metals. The
acid salts of such acids&mdash;as, for instance, of sulphuric acid, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;have
a clearly defined acid reaction, and therefore carbonic acid is unable
to neutralise the powerful basic properties of such alkalis as potash
or soda. Carbonic acid does not even combine at all with feeble bases,
such as alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and therefore if a strong solution of sodium
carbonate, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, be added to a strong solution of aluminium sulphate,
Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, although according to double saline decompositions aluminium
carbonate, Al<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, ought to be formed, the carbonic acid
separates, for this salt splits up in the presence of water into aluminium
hydroxide and carbonic anhydride: Al<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = Al<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>
+ 3CO<sub>2</sub>. Thus feeble bases are unable to retain carbonic acid even at
ordinary temperatures. For the same reason, in the case of bases of
medium energy, although they form carbonates, the latter are comparatively
easily decomposed by heating, as is shown by the decomposition of
copper carbonate, CuCO<sub>3</sub> (<i>see</i> Introduction), and even of calcium carbonate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Only the normal (not the acid) salts of such powerful bases
as potassium and sodium are capable of standing a red heat without
decomposition. The acid salts&mdash;for instance, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>&mdash;decompose
even on heating their solutions (2NaHCO<sub>3</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>),
evolving carbonic anhydride. The amount of heat given out by the
combination of carbonic acid with bases also shows its feeble acid
properties, being considerably less than with energetic acids. Thus
if a weak solution of forty grams of sodium hydroxide be saturated
(up to the formation of a normal salt) with sulphuric or nitric
acid or another powerful acid, from thirteen to fifteen thousand
calories are given out, but with carbonic acid only about ten thousand
calories.<a name="FNanchor_16_526" id="FNanchor_16_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_526" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> The majority of carbonates are insoluble in water, and
therefore such solutions as sodium, potassium, or ammonium carbonates
form in solutions of most other salts, MX or M&#8243;X<sub>2</sub>, insoluble precipitates
of carbonates, M<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> or M&#8243;CO<sub>3</sub>. Thus a solution of barium
chloride gives with sodium carbonate a precipitate of barium carbonate,
BaCO<sub>3</sub>. For this reason rocks, especially those of aqueous origin, very
often contain carbonates; for example, calcium, ferrous, or magnesium
carbonates, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Carbonic anhydride&mdash;which, like water, is formed with the development
of a large amount of heat&mdash;is very stable. Only very few substances
are capable of depriving it of its oxygen. However, certain
metals, such as magnesium, potassium and the like, on being heated, burn
in it, depositing carbon and forming oxides. If a mixture of carbonic
anhydride and hydrogen be passed through a heated tube, the formation
of water and carbonic oxide will be observed; CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> = CO + H<sub>2</sub>O.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
But only a portion of the carbonic acid gas undergoes this change, and
therefore the result will be a mixture of carbonic anhydride, carbonic
oxide, hydrogen, and water, which does not suffer further change under
the action of heat.<a name="FNanchor_17_527" id="FNanchor_17_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_527" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Although, like water, carbonic anhydride is exceedingly
stable, still on being heated it partially decomposes into carbonic
oxide and oxygen. Deville showed that such is the case if carbonic
anhydride be passed through a long tube containing pieces of
porcelain and heated to 1,300°. If the products of decomposition&mdash;namely,
the carbonic oxide and oxygen&mdash;be suddenly cooled, they can be
collected separately, although they partly reunite together. A similar
decomposition of carbonic anhydride into carbonic oxide and oxygen
takes place on passing a series of electric sparks through it (for
instance, in the eudiometer). Under these conditions an increase of
volume occurs, because two volumes of CO<sub>2</sub> give two volumes of CO and
one volume of O. The decomposition reaches a certain limit (less than
one-third) and does not proceed further, so that the result is a
mixture of carbonic anhydride, carbonic oxide, and oxygen, which
is not altered in composition by the continued action of the sparks.
This is readily understood, as it is a reversible reaction. If the
carbonic anhydride be removed, then the mixture explodes when a
spark is passed and forms carbonic anhydride.<a name="FNanchor_17_BIS_528" id="FNanchor_17_BIS_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_BIS_528" class="fnanchor">[17 bis]</a> If from an identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
mixture the oxygen (and not the carbonic anhydride) be removed,
and a series of sparks be again passed, the decomposition is renewed,
and terminates with the complete dissociation of the carbonic
anhydride. Phosphorus is used in order to effect the complete absorption
of the oxygen. In these examples we see that a definite mixture
of changeable substances is capable of arriving at a state of stable
equilibrium, destroyed, however, by the removal of one of the substances
composing the mixture. This is one of the instances of the
influence of mass.</p>

<p>Although carbonic anhydride is decomposed on heating, yielding
oxygen, it is nevertheless, like water, an unchangeable substance at
ordinary temperatures. Its decomposition, as effected by plants, is
on this account all the more remarkable; in this case the whole
of the oxygen of the carbonic anhydride is separated in the free
state. The mechanism of this change is that the heat and light
absorbed by the plants are expended in the decomposition of the
carbonic anhydride. This accounts for the enormous influence of
temperature and light on the growth of plants. But it is at present
not clearly understood how this takes place, or by what separate intermediate
reactions the whole process of decomposition of carbonic
anhydride in plants into oxygen and the carbohydrates (Note <a href="#Footnote_1_508">1</a>)
remaining in them, takes place. It is known that sulphurous anhydride
(in many ways resembling carbonic anhydride) under the action
of light (and also of heat) forms sulphur and sulphuric anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>,
and in the presence of water, sulphuric acid. But no similar decomposition
has been obtained directly with carbonic anhydride, although it
forms an exceedingly easily decomposable higher oxide&mdash;percarbonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
acid;<a name="FNanchor_18_529" id="FNanchor_18_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_529" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> and perhaps that is the reason the oxygen separates. On
the other hand, it is known that plants always form and contain
<i>organic acids</i>, and these must be regarded as derivatives of carbonic
acid, as is seen by all their reactions, of which we will shortly treat.
For this reason it might be thought that the carbonic acid absorbed by
the plants first forms (according to Baeyer) formic aldehyde, CH<sub>2</sub>O,
and from it organic acids, and that these latter in their final transformation
form all the other complex organic substances of the plants.
Many organic acids are found in plants in considerable quantity; for
instance, tartaric acid, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, found in grape-juice and in the acid
juice of many plants; malic acid, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, found not only in unripe
apples but in still larger quantities in mountain ash berries; citric
acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, found in the acid juice of lemons, in gooseberries,
cranberries, &amp;c.; oxalic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, found in wood-sorrel and
many other plants. Sometimes these acids exist in a free state in the
plants, and sometimes in the form of salts; for instance, tartaric acid
is met with in grapes as the salt known as cream of tartar, but in the
impure state called argol, or tartar, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>KO<sub>6</sub>. In sorrel we find the
so-called salts of sorrel, or acid potassium oxalate, C<sub>2</sub>HKO<sub>4</sub>. There is
a very clear connection between carbonic anhydride and the above-mentioned
organic acids&mdash;namely, they all, under one condition or
another, yield carbonic anhydride, and can all be formed by means of it
from substances destitute of acid properties. The following examples
afford the best demonstration of this fact: if acetic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, the
acid of vinegar, be passed in the form of vapour through a heated tube,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
it splits up into carbonic anhydride and marsh gas = CO<sub>2</sub> + CH<sub>4</sub>. But
conversely it can also be obtained from those components into which it
decomposes. If one equivalent of hydrogen in marsh gas be replaced
(by indirect means) by sodium, and the compound CH<sub>3</sub>Na is obtained,
this directly absorbs carbonic anhydride, forming a salt of acetic acid,
CH<sub>3</sub>Na + CO<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>NaO<sub>2</sub>; from this acetic acid itself may be
easily obtained. Thus acetic acid decomposes into marsh gas and
carbonic anhydride, and conversely is obtainable from them. The
hydrogen of marsh gas does not, like that in acids, show the property
of being directly replaced by metals; <i>i.e.</i> CH<sub>4</sub> does not show any acid
character whatever, but on combining with the elements of carbonic
anhydride it acquires the properties of an acid. The investigation of
all other organic acids shows similarly that their acid character depends
on their containing the elements of carbonic anhydride. For this
reason there is no organic acid containing less oxygen in its molecule
than there is in carbonic anhydride; every organic acid contains in its
molecule at least two atoms of oxygen. In order to express the relation
between carbonic acid, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and organic acids, and in order to
understand the reason of the acidity of these latter, it is simplest to
turn to that law of substitution which shows (Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI.</a>) the relation
between the hydrogen and oxygen compounds of nitrogen, and
permits us (Chapter <a href="#Page_338">VIII</a>.) to regard all hydrocarbons as derived
from methane. If we have a given organic compound, A, which
has not the properties of an acid, but contains hydrogen connected
to carbon, as in hydrocarbons, then ACO<sub>2</sub> will be a monobasic
organic acid, A2CO<sub>2</sub> a bibasic, A3CO<sub>2</sub> a tribasic, and so on&mdash;that is,
each molecule of CO<sub>2</sub> transforms one atom of hydrogen into that
state in which it may be replaced by metals, as in acids. This
furnishes a direct proof that in organic acids it is necessary to
recognise the group HCO<sub>2</sub>, or carboxyl. If the addition of CO<sub>2</sub> raises
the basicity, the removal of CO<sub>2</sub> lowers it. Thus from the bibasic
oxalic acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, or phthalic acid, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, by eliminating CO<sub>2</sub>
(easily effected experimentally) we obtain the monobasic formic acid,
CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or benzoic acid, C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, respectively. The nature of carboxyl
is directly explained by the law of substitution. Judging from what
has been stated in Chapters <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>. and <a href="#Page_338">VIII</a>. concerning this law, it
is evident that CO<sub>2</sub> is CH<sub>4</sub> with the exchange of H<sub>4</sub> for O<sub>2</sub>, and that
the hydrate of carbonic anhydride, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is CO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, that is,
methane, in which two parts of hydrogen are replaced by two parts of
the water radical (OH, hydroxyl) and the other two by oxygen.
Therefore the group CO(OH), or carboxyl, HCO<sub>2</sub>, is a part of carbonic
acid, and is equivalent to (OH), and therefore also to H. That is, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
is a univalent residue of carbonic acid capable of replacing one atom
of hydrogen. Carbonic acid itself is a bibasic acid, both hydrogen
atoms in it being replaceable by metals, therefore carboxyl, which contains
one of the hydrogen atoms of carbonic acid, represents a group in
which the hydrogen is exchangeable for metals. And therefore if
1, 2 ... <i>n</i> atoms of non-metallic hydrogen are exchanged 1, 2 ...
<i>n</i> times for carboxyl, we ought to obtain 1, 2 ... <i>n</i>-basic acids.
<i>Organic acids are the products of the carboxyl substitution in
hydrocarbons.</i><a name="FNanchor_18_BIS_530" id="FNanchor_18_BIS_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_BIS_530" class="fnanchor">[18 bis]</a> If in the saturated hydrocarbons, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n + 2</sub>, one part
of hydrogen is replaced by carboxyl, the monobasic saturated (or fatty)
acids, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n + 1</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H), will be obtained, as, for instance, formic acid,
HCO<sub>2</sub>H, acetic acid, CH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, ... stearic acid, C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>35</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H, &amp;c.
The double substitution will give bibasic acids, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H)(CO<sub>2</sub>H);
for instance, oxalic acid <i>n</i> = 0, malonic acid <i>n</i> = 1, succinic acid <i>n</i> = 2,
&amp;c. To benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> correspond benzoic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H), phthalic
acid (and its isomerides), C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>, up to mellitic acid, C<sub>6</sub>(CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>6</sub>,
in all of which the basicity is equal to the number of carboxyl groups.
As many isomerides exist in hydrocarbons, it is readily understood not
only that such can exist also in organic acids, but that their number
and structure may be foreseen. This complex and most interesting
branch of chemistry is treated separately in organic chemistry.</p>

<p><i>Carbonic Oxide.</i>&mdash;This gas is formed whenever the combustion of
organic substances takes place in the presence of a large excess of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
incandescent charcoal; the air first burns the carbon into carbonic
anhydride, but this in penetrating through the red-hot charcoal is
transformed into carbonic oxide, CO<sub>2</sub> + C = 2CO. By this reaction
carbonic oxide is prepared by passing carbonic anhydride through charcoal
at a red heat. It may be separated from the excess of carbonic
anhydride by passing it through a solution of alkali, which does not
absorb carbonic oxide. This reduction of carbonic anhydride explains
why carbonic oxide is formed in ordinary clear fires, where the incoming
air passes over a large surface of heated coal. A blue flame is then
observed burning above the coal; this is the burning carbonic oxide.
When charcoal is burnt in stacks, or when a thick layer of coal is
burning in a brazier, and under many similar circumstances, carbonic
oxide is also formed. In metallurgical processes, for instance when
iron is smelted from the ore, very often the same process of conversion
of carbonic anhydride into carbonic oxide occurs, especially if the
combustion of the coal be effected in high, so-called blast, furnaces and
ovens, where the air enters at the lower part and is compelled to pass
through a thick layer of incandescent coal. In this way, also, combustion
with flame may be obtained from those kinds of fuel which
under ordinary conditions burn without flame: for instance, anthracite,
coke, charcoal. Heating by means
of a gas-producer&mdash;that is, an
apparatus producing combustible
carbonic oxide from fuel&mdash;is
carried on in the same manner.<a name="FNanchor_19_531" id="FNanchor_19_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_531" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
In transforming one part of charcoal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
into carbonic oxide 2,420 heat units are given out, and on burning to
carbonic anhydride 8,080 heat units. It is evident that on transforming
the charcoal first into carbonic oxide we obtain a gas which in burning
is capable of giving out 5,660 heat units for one part of charcoal. This
preparatory transformation of fuel into carbonic oxide, or producer
gas containing a mixture of carbonic oxide (about &#8531; by volume) and
nitrogen (&#8532; volume), in many cases presents most important advantages,
as it is easy to completely burn gaseous fuel without an excess of air,
which would lower the temperature.<a name="FNanchor_20_532" id="FNanchor_20_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_532" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> In stoves where solid fuel is
burnt it is impossible to effect the complete combustion of the various
kinds of fuel without admitting an excess of air. Gaseous fuel, such as
carbonic oxide, is easily completely mixed with air and burnt without
excess of it. If, in addition to this, the air and gas required for the
combustion be previously heated by means of the heat which would
otherwise be uselessly carried off in the products of combustion (smoke)<a name="FNanchor_21_533" id="FNanchor_21_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_533" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
it is easy to reach a high temperature, so high (about 1,800°) that
platinum may be melted. Such an arrangement is known as a <i>regenerative
furnace</i>.<a name="FNanchor_22_534" id="FNanchor_22_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_534" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> By means of this process not only may the high
temperatures indispensable in many industries be obtained (for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>
glass-working, steel-melting, &amp;c.), but great advantage also<a name="FNanchor_23_535" id="FNanchor_23_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_535" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is gained
as regards the quantity of fuel, because the transmission of heat to the
object to be heated, other conditions being equal, is determined by the
difference of temperatures.</p>

<p>The transformation of carbonic anhydride, by means of charcoal,
into carbonic oxide (C + CO<sub>2</sub> = CO + CO) is considered a reversible
reaction, because at a high temperature the carbonic oxide splits up
into carbon and carbonic anhydride, as Sainte-Claire Deville showed by
using the method of the &lsquo;cold and hot tube.&rsquo; Inside a tube heated in
a furnace another thin metallic (silvered copper) tube is fitted, through
which a constant stream of cold water flows. The carbonic oxide
coming into contact with the heated walls of the exterior tube forms
charcoal, and its minute particles settle in the form of lampblack on
the lower side of the cold tube, and, since they are cooled, do not
act further on the oxygen or carbonic anhydride formed.<a name="FNanchor_24_536" id="FNanchor_24_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_536" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> A series<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
of electric sparks also decomposes carbonic oxide into carbonic anhydride
and carbon, and if the carbonic anhydride be removed by alkali complete
decomposition may be obtained (Deville).<a name="FNanchor_24_BIS_537" id="FNanchor_24_BIS_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_BIS_537" class="fnanchor">[24 bis]</a> Aqueous vapour,
which is so similar to carbonic anhydride in many respects, acts, at a
high temperature, on charcoal in an exactly similar way, C + H<sub>2</sub>O
= H<sub>2</sub> + CO. From 2 volumes of carbonic anhydride with charcoal
4 volumes of carbonic oxide (2 molecules) are obtained, and
precisely the same from 2 volumes of water vapour with charcoal
4 volumes of a gas consisting of hydrogen and carbonic oxide (H<sub>2</sub> + CO)
are formed. This mixture of combustible gases is called <i>water gas</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25_538" id="FNanchor_25_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_538" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
But aqueous vapour (and only when strongly superheated, otherwise
it cools the charcoal) only acts on charcoal to form a large amount of
carbonic oxide at a very high temperature (at which carbonic anhydride
dissociates); it begins to react at about 500°, forming carbonic
anhydride according to the equation C + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>. Besides
this, carbonic oxide on splitting up forms carbonic anhydride, and
therefore water gas always contains a mixture<a name="FNanchor_26_539" id="FNanchor_26_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_539" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> in which hydrogen
predominates, the volume of carbonic oxide being comparatively less,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
whilst the amount of carbonic anhydride increases as the temperature
of the reaction decreases (generally it is more than 3 per cent.)</p>

<p>Metals like iron and zinc which at a red heat are capable of
decomposing water with the formation of hydrogen, also decompose
carbonic anhydride with the formation of carbonic oxide; so both
the ordinary products of complete combustion, water and carbonic
anhydride, are very similar in their reactions, and we shall therefore
presently compare hydrogen and carbonic oxide. The metallic oxides
of the above-mentioned metals, when reduced by charcoal, also give
carbonic oxide. Priestley obtained it by heating charcoal with zinc
oxide. As free carbonic anhydride may be transformed into carbonic
oxide, so, in precisely the same way, may that carbonic acid which is
in a state of combination; hence, if magnesium or barium carbonates
(MgCO<sub>3</sub> or BaCO<sub>3</sub>) be heated to redness with charcoal, or iron
or zinc, carbonic oxide will be produced&mdash;for instance, it is obtained by
heating an intimate mixture of 9 parts of chalk and 1 part of charcoal
in a clay retort.</p>

<p>Many organic substances<a name="FNanchor_27_540" id="FNanchor_27_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_540" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> on being heated, or under the action of
various agents, yield carbonic oxide; amongst these are many organic
or carboxylic acids. The simplest are formic and oxalic acids. Formic
acid, CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, on being heated to 200°, easily decomposes into carbonic
oxide and water, CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = CO + H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_27_BIS_541" id="FNanchor_27_BIS_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_BIS_541" class="fnanchor">[27 bis]</a> Usually, however, carbonic
oxide is prepared in laboratories, not from formic but from oxalic
acid, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the more so as formic acid is itself prepared from oxalic
acid. The latter acid is easily obtained by the action of nitric acid on
starch, sugar, &amp;c.; it is also found in nature. Oxalic acid is easily
decomposed by heat; its crystals first lose water, then partly volatilise,
but the greater part is decomposed. The decomposition is of the
following nature: it splits up into water, carbonic oxide, and carbonic
anhydride,<a name="FNanchor_28_542" id="FNanchor_28_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_542" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> + CO. This decomposition is
generally practically effected by mixing oxalic acid with strong sulphuric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
acid, because the latter assists the decomposition by taking up
the water. On heating a mixture of oxalic and sulphuric acids a
mixture of carbonic oxide and carbonic anhydride is evolved. This
mixture is passed through a solution of an alkali in order to absorb
the carbonic anhydride, whilst the carbonic oxide passes on.<a name="FNanchor_28_BIS_543" id="FNanchor_28_BIS_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_BIS_543" class="fnanchor">[28 bis]</a></p>

<p>In its physical <i>properties</i> carbonic oxide resembles nitrogen; this
is explained by the equality of their molecular weights. The absence
of colour and smell, the low temperature of the absolute boiling point,
-140° (nitrogen, -146°), the property of solidifying at -200°
(nitrogen, -202°), the boiling point of -190° (nitrogen, -203°),
and the slight solubility (Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_30_77">30</a>), of carbonic oxide are
almost the same as in those of nitrogen. The chemical properties of
both gases are, however, very different, and in these carbonic oxide
resembles hydrogen. Carbonic oxide burns with a blue flame, giving
2 volumes of carbonic anhydride from 2 volumes of carbonic oxide, just
as 2 volumes of hydrogen give 2 volumes of aqueous vapour. It
explodes with oxygen, in the eudiometer, like hydrogen.<a name="FNanchor_29_544" id="FNanchor_29_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_544" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> When
breathed it acts as a strong poison, being absorbed by the blood;<a name="FNanchor_30_545" id="FNanchor_30_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_545" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
this explains the action of charcoal fumes, the products of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
incomplete combustion of charcoal and other carbonaceous fuels.
Owing to its faculty of combining with oxygen, carbonic oxide acts as
a powerful reducing agent, taking up the oxygen from many compounds
at a red heat, and being itself transformed into carbonic anhydride.
The reducing action of carbonic oxide, however, is (like that of hydrogen,
Chapter <a href="#Page_113">II</a>.) naturally confined to those oxides which easily part
with their oxygen&mdash;as, for instance, copper oxide&mdash;whilst the oxides
of magnesium or potassium are not reduced. Metallic iron itself is
capable of reducing carbonic anhydride to carbonic oxide, just as it
liberates the hydrogen from water. Copper, which does not decompose
water, does not decompose carbonic oxide. If a platinum wire heated
to 300°, or spongy platinum at the ordinary temperature, be plunged
into a mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygen, or of hydrogen and
oxygen, the mixture explodes. These reactions are very similar to
those peculiar to hydrogen. The following important distinction,
however, exists between them&mdash;namely: the molecule of hydrogen is
composed of H<sub>2</sub>, a group of elements divisible into two like parts,
whilst, as the molecule of carbonic oxide, CO, contains unlike atoms of
carbon and oxygen, in none of its reactions of combination can it give
two molecules of matter containing its elements. This is particularly
noticeable in the action of chlorine on hydrogen and on carbonic oxide
respectively; with the former chlorine forms hydrogen chloride, and
with the latter it produces the so-called carbonyl chloride, COCl<sub>2</sub>:
that is to say, the molecule of hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>, under the action of
chlorine divides, forming two molecules of hydrochloric acid, whilst the
molecule of carbonic oxide enters in its entirety into the molecule of carbonyl
chloride. This characterises the so-called <i>diatomic</i> or <i>bivalent</i> reactions
of radicles or <i>residues</i>. H is a monatomic residue or radicle,
like K, Cl, and others, whilst carbonic oxide, CO, is an indivisible (undecomposable)
bivalent radicle, equivalent to H<sub>2</sub> and not to H, and
therefore combining with X<sub>2</sub> and interchangeable with H<sub>2</sub>. This
distinction is evident from the annexed comparison:</p>

<p>Such monatomic (univalent) residues, X, as H, Cl, Na, NO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>4</sub>,
CH<sub>3</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub>H (carboxyl), OH, and others, in accordance with the law
of substitution, combine together, forming compounds, XX'; and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
oxygen, or in general with diatomic (bivalent) residues, Y&mdash;for instance,
O, CO, CH<sub>2</sub>, S, Ca, &amp;c. forming compounds XX&#8242;Y; but diatomic
residues, Y, sometimes capable of existing separately may combine
together, forming YY&#8242; and with X<sub>2</sub> or XX&#8242;, as we see from the transition
of CO into CO<sub>2</sub> and COCl<sub>2</sub>. This combining power of carbonic
oxide appears in many of its reactions. Thus it is very easily absorbed
by cuprous chloride, CuCl, dissolved in fuming hydrochloric
acid, forming a crystalline compound, COCu<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, decomposable
by water; it combines directly with potassium (at 90°), forming
(KCO)<sub><i>n</i></sub><a name="FNanchor_31_546" id="FNanchor_31_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_546" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> with platinum dichloride, PtCl<sub>2</sub>, with chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>But the most remarkable compounds are (1) the compound of CO
with metallic nickel, a colourless volatile liquid, Ni(CO)<sub>4</sub>, obtained by
L. Mond (described in Chapter XXII.) and (2) the compounds of carbonic
oxide with the alkalis, for instance with potassium or barium
hydroxide, &amp;c.&mdash;although it is not directly absorbed by them, as it has
no acid properties. Berthelot (1861) showed that potash in the presence
of water is capable of absorbing carbonic oxide, but the absorption
takes place slowly, little by little, and it is only after being heated
for many hours that the whole of the carbonic oxide is absorbed by
the potash. The salt CHKO<sub>2</sub> is obtained by this absorption; it corresponds
with an acid found in nature&mdash;namely, the simplest organic
(carboxylic) acid, <i>formic acid</i>, CH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It can be extracted from the
potassium salt by means of distillation with dilute sulphuric acid,
just as nitric acid is prepared from sodium nitrate. The same acid
is found in ants and in nettles (when the stings of the nettles puncture
the skin they break, and the corrosive formic acid enters into the
body); it is also obtained during the action of oxidising agents on many
organic substances; it is formed from oxalic acid, and under many
conditions splits up into carbonic oxide and water. In the formation
of formic acid from carbonic oxide we observe an example of the
synthesis of organic compounds, such as are now very numerous, and
are treated of in detail in works on organic chemistry.</p>

<p>Formic acid, H(CHO<sub>2</sub>), carbonic acid, HO(CHO<sub>2</sub>), and oxalic acid,
(CHO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, are the simple organic or carboxylic acids, R(CHO<sub>2</sub>) corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
with HH and HOH. Commencing with carbonic oxide, CO,
the formation of carboxylic acids is clearly seen from the fact that CO is
capable of combining with X<sub>2</sub>, that is of forming COX<sub>2</sub>. If, for instance,
one X is an aqueous residue, OH (hydroxyl), and the other X is hydrogen,
then the simplest organic acid&mdash;formic acid, H(COOH)&mdash;is obtained.
As all hydrocarbons (Chapter <a href="#Page_338">VIII</a>.) correspond with the simplest, CH<sub>4</sub>,
so all organic acids may be considered to proceed from formic acid.</p>

<p>In a similar way it is easy to explain the relation to other compounds
of carbon of those compounds which contain nitrogen. By
way of an example, we will take one of the carboxyl acids, R(CO<sub>2</sub>H),
where R is a hydrocarbon radicle (residue). Such an acid, like all
others, will give by combination with NH<sub>3</sub> an ammoniacal salt,
R(CO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>). This salt contains the elements for the formation of two
molecules of water, and under suitable conditions by the action of
bodies capable of taking it up, water may in fact be separated from
R(CO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>), forming by the loss of one molecule of water, <i>amides</i>,
RCONH<sub>2</sub>, and by the loss of two molecules of water, <i>nitriles</i>, RCN,
otherwise known as <i>cyanogen compounds</i> or <i>cyanides</i>.<a name="FNanchor_32_547" id="FNanchor_32_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_547" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> If all the
carboxyl acids are united not only by many common reactions but
also by a mutual conversion into each other (an instance of which
we saw above in the conversion of oxalic acid into formic and carbonic
acids) one would expect the same for all the cyanogen compounds also.
The common character of their reactions, and the reciprocity of their
transformation, were long ago observed by Gay-Lussac, who recognised
a common group or radicle (residue) cyanogen, CN, in all of
them. The simplest compounds are <i>hydrocyanic</i> or <i>prussic acid</i>, HCN,
cyanic acid, OHCN, and free cyanogen, (CN)<sub>2</sub>, which correspond to the
three simplest carboxyl acids: formic, HCO<sub>2</sub>H, carbonic, OHCO<sub>2</sub>H,
and oxalic, (CO<sub>2</sub>H)<sub>2</sub>. Cyanogen, like carboxyl, is evidently a monatomic
residue and acid, similar to chlorine. As regards the amides
RCONH<sub>2</sub>, corresponding to the carboxyl acids, they contain the
ammoniacal residue NH<sub>2</sub>, and form a numerous class of organic compounds
met with in nature and obtained in many ways,<a name="FNanchor_33_548" id="FNanchor_33_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_548" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
distinguished by such characteristic peculiarities as the cyanogen compounds.</p>

<p>The reactions and properties of the amides and nitriles of the
organic acids are described in detail in books on organic chemistry; we
will here only touch upon the simplest of them, and to clearly explain
the derivative compounds will first consider the ammoniacal salts and
amides of carbonic acid.</p>

<p>As carbonic acid is bibasic, its ammonium salts ought to have the
following composition: <i>acid carbonate of ammonium</i>, H(NH<sub>4</sub>)CO<sub>3</sub>, and
<i>normal carbonate</i>, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>; they represent compounds of one or
two molecules of ammonia with carbonic acid. The acid salt appears
in the form of a non-odoriferous and (when tested with litmus) neutral
substance, soluble at the ordinary temperature in six parts of water,
insoluble in alcohol, and obtainable in a crystalline form either without
water of crystallisation or with various proportions of it. If an aqueous
solution of ammonia be saturated with an excess of carbonic anhydride,
and then evaporated over sulphuric acid in the bell jar of an air-pump,
crystals of this salt are separated. Solutions of all other ammonium
carbonates, when evaporated under the air-pump, yield crystals of this
salt. A solution of this salt, even at the ordinary temperature, gives
off carbonic anhydride, as do all the acid salts of carbonic acid (for
instance, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), and at 38° the separation of carbonic anhydride
takes place with great rapidity. <i>On losing carbonic anhydride</i> and
water, the acid salt is converted into the normal salt, 2(NH<sub>4</sub>)HCO<sub>3</sub>
= H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> + (NH<sub>4</sub>)2CO<sub>3</sub>; the latter, however, decomposes in solution,
and can therefore only be obtained in crystals, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, at
low temperatures, and from solutions containing <i>an excess of ammonia</i>
as the product of dissociation of this salt: (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = NH<sub>3</sub>
+ (NH<sub>4</sub>)HCO<sub>3</sub>. But the normal salt,<a name="FNanchor_34_549" id="FNanchor_34_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_549" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> according to the general type, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
capable of decomposing <i>with separation of water</i>, and forming <i>ammonium
carbamate</i>, NH<sub>4</sub>O(CONH<sub>2</sub>) = (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> - H<sub>2</sub>O; this still further
complicates the chemical transformations of the carbonates of ammonium.
It is in fact evident that, by changing the ratios of
water, ammonia, and carbonic acid, various intermediate salts will be
formed containing mixtures or combinations of those mentioned above.
Thus the ordinary commercial <i>carbonate of ammonia</i> is obtained by
heating a mixture of chalk and sulphate of ammonia (Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>.), or
sal-ammoniac, 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + CaCO<sub>3</sub> = CaCl<sub>2</sub> + (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. The normal
salt, however, through loss of part of the ammonia, partly forms the
acid salt, and, partly through loss of water, forms carbamate, and most
frequently presents the composition NH<sub>4</sub>O(CONH<sub>2</sub>) + 2OH(CO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>)
= 4NH<sub>3</sub> + 3CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. This salt, in parting under various conditions
with ammonia, carbonic anhydride, and water, does not
present a constant composition, and ought rather to be regarded as a
mixture of acid salt and amide salt. The latter must be recognised as
entering into the composition of the ordinary carbonate of ammonia,
because it contains less water than is required for the normal or acid
salt;<a name="FNanchor_35_550" id="FNanchor_35_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_550" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> but on being dissolved in water this salt gives a mixture of acid
and normal salts.</p>

<p>Each of the two ammoniacal salts of carbonic acid has its corresponding
amide. That of the acid salt should be acid, if the water given
off takes up the hydrogen of the ammonia, as it should according to the
common type of formation of the amides, so that OHCONH<sub>2</sub>, or
<i>carbamic acid</i>, is formed from OHCO<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>. This acid is not known in
a free state, but its corresponding ammoniacal salt or <i>ammonium carbamate</i>
is known. The latter is easily and immediately formed by
mixing 2 volumes of <i>dry</i> ammonia with 1 volume of dry carbonic anhydride,
2NH<sub>3</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> = NH<sub>4</sub>O(CONH<sub>2</sub>); it is a solid substance, smells
strongly of ammonia, attracts moisture from the air, and decomposes
completely at 60°. The fact of this decomposition may be proved<a name="FNanchor_36_551" id="FNanchor_36_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_551" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> by
the density of its vapour, which = 13 (H = 1); this exactly corresponds
with the density of a mixture of 2 volumes of ammonia and 1 volume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
of carbonic anhydride. It is easily understood that such a combination
will take place with any ammonium carbonate under the action of salts
which take up the water&mdash;for instance, sodium or potassium carbonate<a name="FNanchor_37_552" id="FNanchor_37_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_552" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>&mdash;as
in an anhydrous state ammonia and carbonic anhydride
only form one compound, CO<sub>2</sub>2NH<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_38_553" id="FNanchor_38_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_553" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> As the normal ammonium carbonate
contains two ammonias, and as the amides are formed with the
separation of water at the expense of the hydrogen of the ammonias,
so this salt has its symmetrical amide, CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. This must be termed
carbamide. It is identical with urea, CN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, which, contained in the
urine (about 2 per cent. in human urine), is for the higher animals
(especially the carnivorous) the ordinary product of excretion<a name="FNanchor_39_554" id="FNanchor_39_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_554" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and
oxidation of the nitrogenous substances found in the organism. If
ammonium carbamate be heated to 140° (in a sealed tube, Bazaroff),
or if carbonyl chloride, COCl<sub>2</sub>, be treated with ammonia (Natanson),
urea will be obtained, which shows its direct connection with carbonic
acid&mdash;that is, the presence of carbonic acid and ammonia in it. From
this it will be understood how urea during the putrefaction of urine is
converted into ammonium carbonate, CN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>Thus urea, both by its origin and decomposition, is an amide of
carbonic acid. Representing as it does ammonia (two molecules) in
which hydrogen (two atoms) is replaced by the bivalent radicle of
carbonic acid, urea retains the property of ammonia of entering into
combination, with acids (thus nitric acid forms CN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O,HNO<sub>3</sub>),
with bases (for instance, with mercury oxide), and with salts (such
as sodium chloride, ammonium chloride), but containing an acid
residue it has no alkaline properties. It is soluble in water without
change, but at a red heat loses ammonia and forms <i>cyanic acid</i>,
CNHO,<a name="FNanchor_39_BIS_555" id="FNanchor_39_BIS_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_BIS_555" class="fnanchor">[39 bis]</a> which is a nitrile of carbonic acid&mdash;that is to say, is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
cyanogen compound, corresponding to the acid ammonium carbonate,
OH(CNH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), which on parting with 2H<sub>2</sub>O ought to form cyanic acid,
CNOH. Liquid cyanic acid, exceedingly unstable at the ordinary
temperatures, gives its stable solid polymer cyanuric acid, O<sub>3</sub>H<sub>3</sub>C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>3</sub>.
Both have the same composition, and they pass one into another at
different temperatures. If crystals of cyanuric acid be heated to a temperature,
<i>t</i>°, then the vapour tension, <i>p</i>, in millimetres of mercury
(Troost and Hautefeuille) will be:</p>

<p>The vapour contains cyanic acid, and, if it be rapidly cooled, it condenses
into a mobile volatile liquid (specific gravity at 0° = 1·14). If
the liquid cyanic acid be gradually heated, it passes into a new amorphous
polymeride (cyamelide), which, on being heated, like cyanuric
acid, forms vapours of cyanic acid. If these fumes are heated above
150° they pass directly into cyanuric acid. Thus at a temperature of
350°, the pressure does not rise above 1,200 mm. on the addition of
vapours of cyanic acid, because the whole excess is transformed into
cyanuric acid. Hence, the above-mentioned figures give the tension of
dissociation of cyanuric acid, or the greatest pressure which the vapours of
HOCN are able to attain at a given temperature, whilst at a greater
pressure, or by the introduction of a larger mass of the substance into a
given volume, the whole of the excess is converted into cyanuric acid.
The properties of cyanic acid which we have described were principally
observed by Wöhler, and clearly show the <i>faculty of polymerisation of
cyanogen compounds</i>. This is observed in many other cyanogen derivatives,
and is to be regarded as the consequence of the above-mentioned
explanation of their nature. All cyanogen compounds are ammonium
salts, R(CNH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), deprived of water, 2H<sub>2</sub>O; therefore the molecules,
RCN, ought to possess the faculty of combining with two molecules of
water or with other molecules in exchange for it (for instance, with
H<sub>2</sub>S, or HCl, or 2H<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.), and are therefore capable of combining together.
The combination of molecules of the same kind to form more
complex ones is what is meant by polymerisation.<a name="FNanchor_40_556" id="FNanchor_40_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_556" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides being a substance very prone to form polymerides, cyanic acid
presents many other features of interest, expounded in greater detail
in organic chemistry. However we may mention here the production
of the cyanates by the oxidation of the metallic cyanides. Potassium
cyanate, KCNO, is most often obtained in this way. Solutions of
cyanates by the addition of sulphuric acid yield cyanic acid, which,
however, immediately decomposes: CNHO + H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub>. A
solution of ammonium cyanate, CN(NH<sub>4</sub>)O, behaves in the same
manner, but only in the cold. On being heated it completely changes
because it is transformed into urea. The composition of both substances
is identical, CN<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O, but the structure, or disposition of, and
connection between, the elements is different: in the ammonium
cyanate one atom of nitrogen exists in the form of cyanogen, CN&mdash;that
is, united with carbon&mdash;and the other as ammonium, NH<sub>4</sub>, but,
as cyanic acid contains the hydroxyl radicle of carbonic acid, OH(CN),
the ammonium in this salt is united with oxygen. The composition of
this salt is best expressed by supposing one atom of the hydrogen in
water to be replaced by ammonium and the other by cyanogen&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
that its composition is not symmetrical&mdash;whilst in urea both the
nitrogen atoms are symmetrically and uniformly disposed as regards
the radicle CO of carbonic acid: CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. For this reason, urea is
much more stable than ammonium cyanate, and therefore the latter,
on being slightly heated in solution, is converted into urea. This
remarkable isomeric transformation was discovered by Wöhler in
1828.<a name="FNanchor_41_557" id="FNanchor_41_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_557" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Formamide, HCONH<sub>2</sub>, and <i>hydrocyanic acid</i>, HCN, as a
nitrile, correspond with formic acid, HCOOH, and therefore ammonium
formate, HCOONH<sub>4</sub>, and formamide, when acted on by heat and by
substances which take up water (phosphoric anhydride) form hydrocyanic
acid, HCN, whilst, under many conditions (for instance, on combining
with hydrochloric acid in presence of water), this hydrocyanic acid forms
formic acid and ammonia. Although containing hydrogen in the
presence of two acid-forming elements&mdash;namely, carbon and nitrogen<a name="FNanchor_42_558" id="FNanchor_42_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_558" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>&mdash;hydrocyanic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
acid does not give an acid reaction with litmus (cyanic
acid has very marked acid properties); <i>but it forms salts</i>, <i>MCN</i>,
thus presenting the properties of a feeble acid, and for this reason is
called an <i>acid</i>. The small amount of energy which it has is shown
by the fact that the cyanides of the alkali metals&mdash;for instance, potassium
cyanide (KHO + HCN = H<sub>2</sub>0 + KCN) in solution have a
strongly alkaline reaction.<a name="FNanchor_43_559" id="FNanchor_43_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_559" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> If ammonia be passed over charcoal at
a red heat, especially in the presence of an alkali, or if gaseous
nitrogen be passed through a mixture of charcoal and an alkali
(especially potash, KHO), and also if a mixture of nitrogenous organic
substances and alkali be heated to a red heat, in all these cases the
alkali metal combines with the carbon and nitrogen, forming a metallic
cyanide, MCN&mdash;for example, KCN.<a name="FNanchor_43_BIS_560" id="FNanchor_43_BIS_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_BIS_560" class="fnanchor">[43 bis]</a> Potassium cyanide is much
used in the arts, and is obtained, as above stated, under many circumstances&mdash;as,
for instance, in iron smelting, especially with the assistance
of wood charcoal, the ash of which contains much potash. The nitrogen
of the air, the alkali of the ash, and the charcoal are brought into
contact at a high temperature during iron smelting, and therefore,
under these conditions, a considerable quantity of potassium cyanide
is formed. In practice it is not usual to prepare potassium cyanide
directly, but a peculiar compound of it containing potassium, iron,
and cyanogen. This compound is potassium ferrocyanide, and is also
known as <i>yellow prussiate of potash</i>. This saline substance (<i>see</i>
Chapter XXII) has the composition K<sub>4</sub>FeC<sub>6</sub>N<sub>6</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. The name
of cyanogen (&#954;&#973;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;) is derived from the property which this yellow
prussiate possesses of forming, with a solution of a ferric salt, FeX<sub>3</sub>,
the familiar pigment Prussian blue. The yellow prussiate is manufactured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
on a large scale, and is generally used as the source of the
other cyanogen compounds.</p>

<p>If four parts of yellow prussiate be mixed with eight parts of water
and three parts of sulphuric acid, and the mixture be heated, it decomposes,
volatile hydrocyanic acid separating. This was obtained for the
first time by Scheele in 1782, but it was only known to him in solution.
In 1809 Ittner prepared anhydrous prussic acid, and in 1815 Gay-Lussac
finally settled its properties and showed that it contains only
hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen, CNH. If the distillate (a weak solution
of HCN) be redistilled, and the first part collected, the anhydrous
acid may be prepared from this stronger solution. In order to do
this, pieces of calcium chloride are added to the concentrated solution,
when the anhydrous acid floats as a separate layer, because it is not
soluble in an aqueous solution of calcium chloride. If this layer be
then distilled over a new portion of calcium chloride at the lowest
temperature possible, the prussic acid may be obtained completely free
from water. It is, however, necessary to use the greatest caution in
work of this kind, because prussic acid, besides being extremely
poisonous, is exceedingly volatile.<a name="FNanchor_44_561" id="FNanchor_44_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_561" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>Anhydrous prussic acid is a very mobile and volatile liquid; its
specific gravity is 0·697 at 18°; at lower temperatures, especially when
mixed with a small quantity of water, it easily congeals; it boils at 26°,
and therefore very easily evaporates, and at ordinary temperatures
may be regarded as a gas. An insignificant amount, when inhaled or
brought into contact with the skin, causes death. It is soluble in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
proportions in water, alcohol, and ether: weak aqueous solutions are
used in medicine.<a name="FNanchor_45_562" id="FNanchor_45_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_562" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>The salts MCN&mdash;for instance, potassium, sodium, ammonium&mdash;as
well as the salts M&#8243;(CN)<sub>2</sub>&mdash;for example, barium, calcium, mercury&mdash;are
soluble in water, but the cyanides of manganese, zinc, lead, and many
others are insoluble in water. They form double salts with potassium
cyanide and similar metallic cyanides, an example of which we will consider
in a further description of the yellow prussiate. Not only are
some of the double salts remarkable for their constancy and comparative
stability, but so also are the soluble salt HgC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, the insoluble silver
cyanide AgCN, and even potassium cyanide in the absence of water.
The last salt,<a name="FNanchor_46_563" id="FNanchor_46_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_563" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> when fused, acts as a reducing agent with its elements
K and C, and oxidises when fused with lead oxide, forming potassium
cyanate, KOCN, which establishes the connection between HCN and
OHCN&mdash;that is, between the nitriles of formic and carbonic acids&mdash;and
this connection is the same as that between the acids themselves, since
formic acid, on oxidation, yields carbonic acid. Free cyanogen, (CN)<sub>2</sub>
or CNCN, corresponds to hydrocyanic acid in the same manner as free
chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub> or ClCl, corresponds to hydrochloric acid. This composition,
judging from what has been already stated, exactly expresses that of
the nitrile of oxalic acid, and, as a matter of fact, oxalate of ammonia
and the amide corresponding with it (oxamide, Note <a href="#Footnote_33_548">33</a>), on being heated
with phosphoric anhydride, which takes up the water, yield <i>cyanogen</i>,
(CN)<sub>2</sub>. This substance is also produced by simply heating some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
metallic cyanides. Mercuric cyanide is particularly adapted for this
purpose, because it is easily obtained in a pure state and is then very
stable. If mercuric cyanide be heated, it decomposes, in like manner
to mercury oxide, into metallic mercury and cyanogen: HgC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub> = Hg
+ C<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_47_564" id="FNanchor_47_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_564" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> When cyanogen is formed, part of it always polymerises
into a dark brown insoluble substance called <i>paracyanogen</i>, capable of
forming cyanogen when heated to redness.<a name="FNanchor_48_565" id="FNanchor_48_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_565" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Cyanogen is a colourless,
poisonous gas, with a peculiar smell and easily condensed by cooling
into a colourless liquid, insoluble in water and having a specific gravity
of 0·86. It boils at about -21°, and therefore cyanogen may be easily
condensed into a liquid by a strong freezing mixture. At -35° liquid
cyanogen solidifies. The gas is soluble in water and in alcohol to a
considerable extent&mdash;namely, 1 volume of water absorbs as much as
4&frac12; volumes, and alcohol 23 volumes. Cyanogen resists the action of
a tolerably high temperature without decomposing, but under the action
of the electric spark the carbon is separated, leaving a volume of
nitrogen equal to the volume of the gas taken. As it contains carbon
it burns, and the colour of the flame is reddish-violet, which is due to
the presence of nitrogen, all compounds of which impart more or less
of this reddish-violet hue to the flame. During the combustion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
cyanogen, carbonic anhydride and nitrogen are formed. The same
products are obtained in the eudiometer with oxygen or by the action
of cyanogen on many oxides at a red heat.</p>

<p>The relation of cyanogen to the metallic cyanides is seen not only
in the fact that it is formed from mercuric cyanide, but also by its
forming cyanide of sodium or potassium on being heated with either of
those metals, the sodium or potassium taking fire in the cyanogen.
On heating a mixture of hydrogen and cyanogen to 500° (Berthelot),<a name="FNanchor_49_566" id="FNanchor_49_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_566" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
or under the action of the silent discharge (Boilleau), hydrocyanic
acid is formed, so that the reciprocity of the transitions does not
leave any doubt in the matter that all the nitriles of the organic acids
contain cyanogen, just as all the organic acids contain carboxyl and
in it the elements of carbonic anhydride. Besides the amides,<a name="FNanchor_50_567" id="FNanchor_50_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_567" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the
nitriles (or cyanogen compounds, RCN), and nitro-compounds (containing
the radicle of nitric acid, RNO<sub>2</sub>), there are a great number
of other substances containing at the same time carbon and nitrogen,
particulars of which must be sought for in special works on organic
chemistry.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_508" id="Footnote_1_508"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_508"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The quantity of carbonic acid gas exhaled by a man during the twenty-four hours
is not evenly produced; during the night more oxygen is taken in than during the
day (by night, in twelve hours, about 450 grams), and more carbonic anhydride is separated
by day than during night-time and repose; thus, of the 900 grams produced
during the twenty-four hours about 375 are given out during the night and 525 by day.
This depends on the formation of carbonic anhydride during the work performed by the
man in the day. Every movement is the result of some change of matter, for
force cannot be self-created (in accordance with the law of the conservation of energy).
Proportionally to the amount of carbon consumed an amount of energy is stored up in
the organism and is consumed in the various movements performed by animals. This
is proved by the fact that during work a man exhales 525 grams of carbonic anhydride
in twelve hours instead of 375, absorbing the same amount of oxygen as before. After
a working day a man exhales by night almost the same amount of carbonic anhydride
as after a day of rest, so that during a total twenty-four hours a man exhales about
900 grams of carbonic anhydride and absorbs about 980 grams of oxygen. Therefore
during work the change of matter increases. The carbon expended on the work
is obtained from the food; on this account the food of animals ought certainly to
contain carbonaceous substances capable of dissolving under the action of the digestive
fluids, and of passing into the blood, or, in other words, capable of being digested. Such
food for man and all other animals is formed of vegetable matter, or of parts of other
animals. The latter in every case obtain their carbonaceous matter from plants, in
which it is formed by the separation of the carbon from the carbonic anhydride taken up
during the day by the respiration of the plants. The volume of the oxygen exhaled by
plants is almost equal to the volume of the carbonic anhydride absorbed; that is to say,
nearly all the oxygen entering into the plant in the form of carbonic anhydride is liberated
in a free state, whilst the carbon from the carbonic anhydride remains in the plant.
At the same time the plant absorbs moisture by its leaves and roots. By a process which
is unknown to us, this absorbed moisture and the carbon obtained from the carbonic anhydride
enter into the composition of the plants in the form of so-called carbohydrates,
composing the greater part of the vegetable tissues, starch and cellulose of the composition
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub> being representatives of them. They may be considered like all carbohydrates
as compounds of carbon and water, 6C + 5H<sub>2</sub>O. In this way a <i>circulation</i> of
the carbon goes on in nature by means of vegetable and animal organisms, in which
changes the principal factor is the carbonic anhydride of the air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_509" id="Footnote_2_509"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_509"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Other acids may be used instead of hydrochloric; for instance, acetic, or even
sulphuric, although this latter is not suitable, because it forms as a product insoluble
calcium sulphate (gypsum) which surrounds the untouched calcium carbonate, and thus
prevents a further evolution of gas. But if porous limestone&mdash;for instance, chalk&mdash;be
treated with sulphuric acid diluted with an equal volume of water, the liquid is absorbed
and acting on the mass of the salt, the evolution of carbonic anhydride continues evenly
for a long time. Instead of calcium carbonate other carbonates may of course be used;
for instance, washing-soda, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, which is often chosen when it is required to produce
a rapid stream of carbonic anhydride (for example, for liquefying it). But natural
crystalline magnesium carbonate and similar salts are with difficulty decomposed by
hydrochloric and sulphuric acids. When for manufacturing purposes&mdash;for instance, in
precipitating lime in sugar-works&mdash;a large quantity of carbonic acid gas is required, it
is generally obtained by burning charcoal, and the products of combustion, rich in
carbonic anhydride, are pumped into the liquid containing the lime, and the carbonic
anhydride is thus absorbed. Another method is also practised, which consists in using
the carbonic anhydride separated during fermentation, or that evolved from limekilns.
During the fermentation of sweet-wort, grape-juice, and other similar saccharine solutions,
the glucose C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> changes under the influence of the yeast organism, forming
alcohol (2C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O), and carbonic anhydride (2CO<sub>2</sub>) which separates in the form of gas; if
the fermentation proceeds in closed bottles sparkling wine is obtained. When carbonic
acid gas is prepared for saturating water and other beverages it is necessary to use it
in a pure state. Whilst in the state in which it is evolved from ordinary limestones by
the aid of acids it contains, besides a certain quantity of acid, the organic matters of the
limestone; in order to diminish the quantity of these substances the densest kinds of
dolomites are used, which contain less organic matter, and the gas formed is passed
through various washing apparatus, and then through a solution of potassium permanganate,
which absorbs organic matter and does not take up carbonic anhydride.</p></div>

hydrogen sulphide has the same relation to carbonic acid as nitric acid to hydrochloric&mdash;an
excess of either one displaces the other.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_511" id="Footnote_4_511"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_511"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Thus, in preparing the ordinary effervescing powders, sodium bicarbonate (or acid
carbonate of soda) is used, and mixed with powdered citric or tartaric acid. In a dry
state these powders do not evolve carbonic anhydride, but when mixed with water the
evolution takes place briskly, which is due to the substances passing into solution. The
salts of carbonic acid may be recognised from the fact that they evolve carbonic acid
with a hissing noise when treated with acids. If vinegar, which contains acetic acid, be
poured upon limestone, marble, malachite (containing copper carbonate), &amp;c., carbonic
anhydride is evolved with a hissing noise. It is noteworthy that neither hydrochloric
acid, nor even sulphuric acid nor acetic acid, acts on limestone except in presence of
water. We shall refer to this later on.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_512" id="Footnote_5_512"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_512"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The direct observations made (1876) by Messrs. Bogouski and Kayander lead to the
conclusion that the quantity of carbonic anhydride evolved by the action of acids on
marble (as homogeneous as possible) is directly proportional to the time of action, the
extent of surface, and the degree of concentration of the acid, and inversely proportional
to the molecular weight of the acid. If the surface of a piece of Carrara marble be equal
to one decimetre, the time of action one minute, and one cubic decimetre or litre contains
one gram of hydrochloric acid, then about 0·02 gram of carbonic anhydride will be
evolved. If the litre contains <i>n</i> grams of hydrochloric acid, then by experiment the
amount will be <i>n</i> × 0·02 of carbonic anhydride. Therefore, if the litre contains 36·5
(= HCl) grams, about 0·73 gram of carbonic anhydride (about half a litre) would he
evolved per minute. If nitric acid or hydrobromic acid be used instead of hydrochloric,
then, with a combining proportion of the acid, the same quantity of carbonic anhydride
will be evolved; thus, if the litre contains 63 (= HNO<sub>3</sub>) grams of nitric acid, or 81
(= HBr) grams of hydrobromic acid, the quantity of carbonic anhydride evolved will still
be 0·73 gram. Spring, in 1890, made a series of similar determinations.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_513" id="Footnote_6_513"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_513"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> As carbonic anhydride is one and a half times heavier than air, it diffuses with
difficulty, and therefore does not easily mix with air, but sinks in it. This may be shown
in various ways; for instance, the gas may be carefully poured from one vessel into another
containing air. If a lighted taper be plunged into the vessel containing carbonic anhydride
it is extinguished, and then, after pouring the gas into the other cylinder, it will
burn in the former and be extinguished in the latter. If a certain quantity of carbonic
anhydride be poured into a vessel containing air, and soap-bubbles be introduced, they
will only sink as far as the stratum where the atmosphere of carbonic anhydride commences,
as this latter is heavier than the soap-bubbles filled with air. Naturally, after a
certain lapse of time, the carbonic anhydride will be diffused throughout the vessel, and
form a uniform mixture with the air, just as salt in water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_514" id="Footnote_7_514"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_514"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> This liquefaction was first observed by Faraday, who sealed up in a tube a mixture
of a carbonate and sulphuric acid. Afterwards this method was very considerably improved
by Thilorier and Natterer, whose apparatus is given in Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>. in describing
N<sub>2</sub>O. It is, however, necessary to remark that the preparation of liquid carbonic
anhydride requires good liquefying apparatus, constant cooling, and a rapid preparation
of large masses of carbonic anhydride.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_515" id="Footnote_8_515"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_515"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Carbonic anhydride, having the same molecular weight as nitrous oxide, very much
resembles it when in a liquid state.</p></div>

can be easily preserved, because a thick tube easily supports the pressure (about 50

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_517" id="Footnote_9_517"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_517"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> When a fine stream of liquid carbonic anhydride is discharged into a closed metallic
vessel, about one-third of its mass solidifies and the remainder evaporates. In employing
solid carbonic anhydride for making experiments at low temperatures, it is best to use it
mixed with ether, otherwise there will be few points of contact. If a stream of air be
blown through a mixture of liquid carbonic anhydride and ether, the evaporation proceeds
rapidly, and great cold is obtained. At present in some special manufactories (and for
making artificial mineral waters) carbonic anhydride is liquefied on the large scale, filled
into wrought-iron cylinders provided with a valve, and in this manner it can be transported
and preserved safely for a long time. It is used, for instance, in breweries.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_BIS_518" id="Footnote_9_BIS_518"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_BIS_518"><span class="label">[9 bis]</span></a> Solid carbonic anhydride, notwithstanding its very low temperature, can be
safely placed on the hand, because it continually evolves gas which prevents its coming
into actual contact with the skin, but if a piece be squeezed between the fingers, it produces
a severe frost bite similar to a burn. If the snow-like solid be mixed with ether, a
semi-liquid mass is obtained, which is employed for artificial refrigeration. This mixture
may be used for liquefying many other gases&mdash;such as chlorine, nitrous oxide, hydrogen
sulphide, and others. The evaporation of such a mixture proceeds with far greater
rapidity under the receiver of an air-pump, and consequently the refrigeration is more
intense. By this means many gases may be liquefied which resist other methods&mdash;namely,
olefiant gas, hydrochloric acid gas, and others. Liquid carbonic anhydride in
this case congeals in the tube into a glassy transparent mass. Pictet availed himself of
this method for liquefying many permanent gases (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_113">II</a>.)</p>

<p>Bleekrode, by compressing solid CO<sub>2</sub> in a cylinder by means of a piston, obtained a
semi-transparent stick, which contained as much as 1·3 and even 1·6 gram of CO<sub>2</sub> per
cubic centimetre. In this form the CO<sub>2</sub> slowly evaporated, and could be kept for a long
time.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_519" id="Footnote_10_519"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_519"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> If such water trickles through crevices and enters a cavern, the evaporation will
be slow, and therefore in those places from which the water drips growths of calcium
carbonate will be formed, just like the icicles formed on the roof-gutters in winter-time.
Similar conical and cylindrical stony growths form the so-called stalactites or pendants
hanging from above and stalagmites formed on the bottom of caves. Sometimes these
two kinds meet together, forming entire columns filling the cave. Many of these caves
are remarkable for their picturesqueness; for instance, the cave of Antiparos, in the
Grecian Archipelago. This same cause also forms spongy masses of calcium carbonate
in those places where the springs come to the surface of the earth. It is therefore very
evident that a calcareous solution is sometimes capable of penetrating plants and filling
the whole of their mass with calcium carbonate. This is one of the forms of petrified
plants. Calcium phosphate in solution in water containing carbonic acid plays an important
part in the nourishment of plants, because all plants contain both lime and
phosphoric acid.</p></div>

long tube, closed at one end, and filling it with this gas; a test-tube is then filled with a
solution of an alkali (for instance, sodium hydroxide), which is then poured into the long
tube and the open end is corked. The solution is then well shaken in the tube, and the
corked end plunged into water. If the cork be now withdrawn under water, the water
will fill the tube. The vacuum obtained by the absorption of the carbonic anhydride by
an alkali is so complete that even an electric discharge will not pass through it. This
method is often applied to produce a vacuum.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_523" id="Footnote_13_523"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_523"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Up to the year 1840, or thereabout, acids were not distinguished by their basicity.
Graham, while studying phosphoric acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, and Liebig, while studying many organic
acids, distinguished mono-, bi-, and tribasic acids. Gerhardt and Laurent generalised
these relations, showing that this distinction extends over many reactions (for instance,
to the faculty of bibasic acids of forming acid salts with alkalis, KHO or NaHO, or with
alcohols, RHO, &amp;c.); but now, since a definite conception as to atoms and molecules
has been arrived at, <i>the basicity of an acid is determined by the number of
hydrogen atoms,</i> contained in a molecule of the acid, which can be exchanged for metals.
If carbonic acid forms acid salts, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, and normal salts, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, it is evident that
the hydrate is H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, a bibasic acid. Otherwise it is at present impossible to account
for the composition of these salts. But when C=6 and O=8 were taken, then the formula
CO<sub>2</sub> expressed the composition, but not the molecular weight, of carbonic anhydride; and
the composition of the normal salt would be Na<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub> or NaCO<sub>3</sub>, therefore carbonic acid
might have been considered as a monobasic acid. Then the acid salt would have been
represented by NaCO<sub>3</sub>,HCO<sub>3</sub>. Such questions were the cause of much argument and difference
of opinion among chemists about forty years ago. At present there cannot be two
opinions on the subject if the law of Avogadro-Gerhardt and its consequences be strictly
adhered to. It may, however, be observed here that the monobasic acids R(OH) were
for a long time considered to be incapable of being decomposed into water and anhydride,
and this property was ascribed to the bibasic acids R(OH)<sub>2</sub> as containing the elements
necessary for the separation of the molecule of water, H<sub>2</sub>O. Thus H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or SO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, or CO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, and other bibasic acids decompose into an anhydride, RO, and water,
H<sub>2</sub>O. But as nitrous, HNO<sub>2</sub>, iodic, HIO<sub>3</sub>, hypochlorous, HClO, and other monobasic
acids easily give their anhydrides N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>O, &amp;c., that method of distinguishing
the basicity of acids, although it fairly well satisfies the requirements of organic chemistry,
cannot be considered correct. It may also be remarked that up to the present time
not one of the bibasic acids has been found to have the faculty of being distilled without
being decomposed into anhydride and water (even H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, on being evaporated and distilled,
gives SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O), and the decomposition of acids into water and anhydride proceeds
particularly easily in dealing with feebly energetic acids, such as carbonic, nitrous,
boric, and hypochlorous. Let us add that carbonic acid, as a hydrate corresponding to
marsh gas, C(HO)<sub>4</sub> = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O, ought to be tetrabasic. But in general it does not form
such salts. Basic salts, however, such as CuCO<sub>3</sub>CuO, may be regarded in this sense,
for CCu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> corresponds with CH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, as Cu corresponds with H<sub>2</sub>. Amongst the
ethereal salts (alcoholic derivatives) of carbonic acid corresponding cases are, however,
observed; for instance, ethylic orthocarbonate, C(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> (obtained by the action of
chloropicrin, C(NO<sub>2</sub>)Cl<sub>3</sub>, on sodium ethoxide, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>ONa; boiling point 158°; specific
gravity, 0·92). The name <i>orthocarbonic acid</i> for CH<sub>4</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is taken from <i>orthophosphoric
acid</i>, PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which corresponds with PH<sub>3</sub> (<i>see</i> Chapter on Phosphorus).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_524" id="Footnote_14_524"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_524"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Long ago endeavours were made to find a <i>measure of affinity</i> of acids and bases,
because some of the acids, such as sulphuric or nitric, form comparatively stable salts, decomposed
with difficulty by heat and water, whilst others, like carbonic and hypochlorous
acids, do not combine with feeble bases, and with most of the other bases form salts which
are easily decomposed. The same may be said with regard to bases, among which those of
potassium, K<sub>2</sub>O, sodium, Na<sub>2</sub>O, and barium, BaO, may serve as examples of the most
powerful, because they combine with the most feeble acids and form a mass of salts of
great stability, whilst as examples of the feeblest bases alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or bismuth oxide,
Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, may be taken, because they form salts easily decomposed by water and by heat
if the acid be volatile. Such a division of acids and bases into the feeblest and most
powerful is justified by all evidence concerning them, and is quoted in this work. But
the teaching of this subject in certain circles has acquired quite a new tone, which, in my
opinion, cannot be accepted without certain reservations and criticisms, although it comprises
many interesting features. The fact is that Thomsen, Ostwald, and others proposed
to express the measure of affinity of acids to bases by figures drawn from data of the
measure of displacement of acids in aqueous solutions, judging (1) from the amount of
heat developed by mixing a solution of the salt with a solution of another acid (the
avidity of acids, according to Thomsen); (2) from the change of the volumes accompanying
such a mutual action of solutions (Ostwald); (3) from the change of the
index of refraction of solutions (Ostwald), &amp;c. Besides this there are many other
methods which allow us to form an opinion about the distribution of bases among
various acids in aqueous solutions. Some of these methods will be described
hereafter. It ought, however, to be remarked that in making investigations in aqueous
solutions the affinity to water is generally left out of sight. If a base N, combining
with acids X and Y in presence of them both, divides in such a way that one-third
of it combines with X and two-thirds with Y, a conclusion is formed that the affinity,
or power of forming salts, of the acid Y is twice as great as that of X. But the presence
of the water is not taken into account. If the acid X has an affinity for water and for N
it will be distributed between them; and if X has a greater affinity for water than Y,
then less of X will combine with N than of Y. If, in addition to this, the acid X is
capable of forming an acid salt NX<sub>2</sub>, and Y is not, the conclusion of the relative strength
of X and Y will be still more erroneous, because the X set free will form such a salt on
the addition of Y to NX. We shall see in Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>. that when sulphuric and nitric
acids in weak aqueous solution act on sodium, they are distributed exactly in this way:
namely, one-third of the sodium combines with the sulphuric and two-thirds with the
nitric acid; but, in my opinion, this does not show that sulphuric acid, compared with
nitric acid, possesses but half the degree of affinity for bases like soda, and only demonstrates
the greater affinity of sulphuric acid for water compared with that of nitric acid.
In this way the methods of studying the distribution in aqueous solutions probably only
shows the difference of the relation of the acid to a base and to water.</p>

<p>In view of these considerations, although the teaching of the distribution of salt-forming
elements in <i>aqueous solutions</i> is an object of great and independent interest, it
can hardly serve to determine the measure of affinity between bases and acids. Similar
considerations ought to be kept in view when determining the energy of acids by means of
the <i>electrical conductivity of their weak solutions</i>. This method, proposed by Arrhenius
(1884), and applied on an extensive scale by Ostwald (who developed it in great detail in
his <i>Lehrbuch d. allgemeinen Chemie</i>, v. ii., 1887), is founded on the fact that the relation
of the so-called molecular electrical-conductivity of weak solutions of various acids
(I) coincides with the relation in which the same acids stand according to the distribution,
(II) found by one of the above-mentioned methods, and with the relation deduced for
them from observations upon the velocity of reaction, (III) for instance, according to the
rate of the splitting up of an ethereal salt (into alcohol and acid), or from the rate of the so-called
inversion of sugar&mdash;that is, its transformation into glucose&mdash;as is seen by comparing
the annexed figures, in which the energy of hydrochloric acid is taken as equal to
100:&mdash;</p>

<p>The coincidence of these figures, obtained by so many various methods, presents a
most important and instructive relation between phenomena of different kinds, but in my
opinion it does not permit us to assert that the degree of affinity existing between bases
and various acids is determined by all these various methods, because the influence of the
water must be taken into consideration. On this account, until the theory of solution
is more thoroughly worked out, this subject (which for the present ought to be treated
of in special treatises on chemical mechanics) must be treated with great caution.
But now we may hope to decide this question guided by a study of the rate of reaction,
the influence of acids and bases upon indicators, &amp;c., all of which are treated fully in
works on physical and theoretical chemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_525" id="Footnote_15_525"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_525"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Thus, for instance, in the washing of fabrics the caustic alkalis, such as sodium
hydroxide, in weak solutions, act in removing the fatty matter just in the same way as
carbonate solutions; for instance, a solution of soda crystals, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. Soap acts in the
same way, being composed of feeble acids, either fatty or resinous, combined with alkali.
On this account all such substances are applied in manufacturing processes, and answer
equally well in practice for bleaching and washing fabrics. Soda crystals or soap are
preferred to caustic alkali, because an excess of the latter may have a destructive effect
on the fabrics. It may be supposed that in aqueous solutions of soap or soda
crystals, part of the base will form caustic alkali; that is to say, the water will compete
with the weak acids, and the alkali will be distributed between them and the water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_526" id="Footnote_16_526"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_526"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Although carbonic acid is reckoned among the feeble acids, yet there are evidently
many others still feebler&mdash;for instance, prussic acid, hypochlorous acid, many
organic acids, &amp;c. Bases like alumina, or such feeble acids as silica, when in combination
with alkalis, are decomposed in aqueous solutions by carbonic acid, but on fusion&mdash;that
is, without the presence of water&mdash;they displace it, which clearly shows in phenomena of
this kind how much depends upon the conditions of reaction and the properties of the
substances formed. These relations, which at first sight appear complex, may be best
understood if we represent that two salts, MX and NY, in general always give more or
less of two other salts, MY and NX, and then examine the properties of the derived substances.
Thus, in solution, sodium silicate, Na<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>3</sub>, with carbonic anhydride will to some
extent form sodium carbonate and silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>; but the latter, being colloid, separates, and
the remaining mass of sodium silicate is again decomposed by carbonic anhydride, so that
finally silica separates and sodium carbonate is formed. In a fused state the case is
different; sodium carbonate will react with silica to form carbonic anhydride and sodium
silicate, but the carbonic anhydride will be separated as a gas, and therefore in the
residue the same reaction will again take place, and ultimately the carbonic anhydride is
entirely eliminated and sodium silicate remains. If, on the other hand, nothing is removed
from the sphere of the reaction, distribution takes place. Therefore, although carbonic
anhydride is a feeble acid, still not for this reason, but only in virtue of its gaseous
form, do all soluble acids displace it in saline solutions (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_527" id="Footnote_17_527"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_527"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> Hydrogen and carbon are near akin to oxygen as regards affinity, but it ought to
be considered that the affinity of hydrogen is slightly greater than that of carbon, because
during the combustion of hydrocarbons the hydrogen burns first. Some idea of
this similarity of affinity may be formed by the quantity of heat evolved. Gaseous
hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub>, on combining with an atom of oxygen, O = 16, develops 69,000 heat-units
if the water formed be condensed to a liquid state. If the water remains in the form of
a gas (steam) the latent heat of evaporation must be subtracted, and then 58,000 calories
will be developed. Carbon, C, as a solid, on combining with O<sub>2</sub> = 32 develops about
97,000 calories, forming gaseous CO<sub>2</sub>. If it were gaseous like hydrogen, and only
contained C<sub>2</sub> in its molecule, much more heat would be developed, and judging
by other substances, whose molecules on passing from the solid to the gaseous
state absorb about 10,000 to 15,000 calories, it must be held that gaseous carbon on
forming gaseous carbonic anhydride would develop not less than 110,000 calories&mdash;that
is, approximately twice as much as is developed in the formation of water. And since
there is twice as much oxygen in a molecule of carbonic anhydride as in a molecule of
water, the oxygen develops approximately the same quantity of heat on combining with
hydrogen as with carbon. That is to say, that here we find the same close affinity (<i>see</i>
Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_7_130">7</a>) determined by the quantity of heat as between hydrogen, zinc, and
iron. For this reason here also, as in the case of hydrogen and iron, we ought to expect
an equal distribution of oxygen between hydrogen and carbon, if they are both in
excess compared with the amount of oxygen; but if there be an excess of carbon, it will
decompose water, whilst an excess of hydrogen will decompose carbonic anhydride. Even
if these phenomena and similar ones have been explained in isolated cases, a complete
theory of the whole subject is still wanting in the present condition of chemical knowledge.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_BIS_528" id="Footnote_17_BIS_528"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_BIS_528"><span class="label">[17 bis]</span></a> The degree or relative magnitude of the dissociation of CO<sub>2</sub> varies with the
temperature and pressure&mdash;that is, it increases with the temperature and as the pressure
decreases. Deville found that at a pressure of 1 atmosphere in the flame of carbonic
oxide burning in oxygen, about 40 per cent. of the CO<sub>2</sub>, is decomposed when the temperature
is about 3,000°, and at 1,500° less than 1 per cent. (Krafts); whilst under a pressure
of 10 atmospheres about 34 per cent. is decomposed at 3,300° (Mallard and Le Chatelier).
It follows therefore that, under very small pressures, the dissociation of CO<sub>2</sub> will be
considerable even at comparatively moderate temperatures, but at the temperature of
ordinary furnaces (about 1,000°) even under the small partial pressure of the carbonic
acid, there are only small traces of decomposition which may be neglected in a practical
estimation of the combustion of fuels. We may here cite the molecular specific heat of
CO<sub>2</sub> (<i>i.e.</i> the amount of heat required to raise 44 units of weight of CO<sub>2</sub> 1°), according
to the determinations and calculations of Mallard and Le Chatelier, for a constant
volume C<sub>v</sub> = 6·26 + 0·0037<i>t</i>; for a constant pressure C<sub>p</sub> = C<sub>v</sub> + 2 (<i>see</i> Chapter XIV., Note <a href="#Footnote_7_834">7</a>),
<i>i.e.</i> the specific heat of CO<sub>2</sub> increases rapidly with a rise of temperature: for example, at
0° (per 1 part by weight), it is, at a constant pressure = 0·188, at 1,000° = 0·272, at 2,000°,
about 0·356. A perfectly distinct rise of the specific heat (for example, at 2,000°, 0·409), is
given by a comparison of observations made by the above-mentioned investigators and by
Berthelot and Vieille (Kournakoff). The cause of this must be looked for in dissociation.
T. M. Cheltzoff, however, considers upon the basis of his researches upon explosives that
it must be admitted that a maximum is reached at a certain temperature (about 2,500°),
beyond which the specific heat begins to fall.</p></div>

from carbonic acid in the action of light upon plants, (in the same manner as, according
to the above scheme, sulphuric acid from sulphurous) with the formation of carbon,
which remains in the form of hydrates of carbon: 3H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = 2H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>4</sub> + CH<sub>2</sub>O. This
substance CH<sub>2</sub>O expresses the composition of formic aldehyde which, according to
Baeyer, by polymerisation and further changes, gives other hydrates of carbon and forms
the first product which is formed in plants from CO<sub>2</sub>. And Berthelot (1872) had already,
at the time of the discovery of persulphuric (Chapter XX.) and pernitric (Chapter VI.,
Note 26) acids pointed out the formation of the unstable percarbonic anhydride, CO<sub>3</sub>.
Thus, notwithstanding the hypothetical nature of the above equation, it may be admitted
all the more as it explains the comparative abundance of peroxide of hydrogen (Schöne,
Chapter <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>.) in the air, and this also at the period of the most energetic growth of
plants (in July), because percarbonic acid should like all peroxides easily give H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
Besides which Bach (1894) showed that, in the first place, traces of formic aldehyde
and oxidising agents (CO<sub>3</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) are formed under the simultaneous action of CO<sub>2</sub>
and sunlight upon a solution containing a salt of uranium (which is oxidised), and diethylaniline
(which reacts with CH<sub>2</sub>O), and secondly, that by subjecting BaO<sub>2</sub>, shaken up in
water, to the action of a stream of CO<sub>2</sub> in the cold, extracting (also in the cold) with
ether, and then adding an alcoholic solution of NaHO, crystalline plates of a sodium
salt may be obtained, which with water evolve oxygen and leave sodium carbonate;
they are therefore probably the per-salt. All these facts are of great interest and
deserve further verification and elaboration.</p></div>

the hydrogen of hydrocarbons, and giving them the character of comparatively
feeble acids, then SO<sub>3</sub> is the anhydride of an energetic bibasic acid, and <i>sulphoxyl</i>,
SO<sub>2</sub>(OH), corresponds with it, being capable of replacing the hydrogen of hydrocarbons,
and forming comparatively energetic <i>sulphur oxyacids</i> (<i>sulphonic acids</i>); for instance,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(COOH), benzoic acid, and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(SO<sub>2</sub>OH), benzenesulphonic acid, are derived from
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. As the exchange of H for methyl, CH<sub>3</sub>, is equivalent to the addition of CH<sub>2</sub>, the
exchange of carboxyl, COOH, is equivalent to the addition of CO<sub>2</sub>; so the exchange of H
for sulphoxyl is equivalent to the addition of SO<sub>3</sub>. The latter proceeds directly, for
instance: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(SO<sub>2</sub>OH).</p>

<p>As, according to the determinations of Thomsen, the heat of combustion of the <i>vapours</i>
of acids RCO<sub>2</sub> is known where R is a hydrocarbon, and the heat of combustion of the
hydrocarbons R themselves, it may be seen that the formation of acids, RCO<sub>2</sub>, from
R + CO<sub>2</sub>, is always accompanied by a <i>small</i> absorption or development of heat. We give
the heats of combustion in thousands of calories, referred to the molecular weights of
the substances:&mdash;</p>

The data for the latter are taken from Stohmann, and refer to the solid condition. For
formic acid Stohmann gives the heat of combustion as 59,000 calories in a liquid state,

Thomsen.</p></div>

monoxide for heating purposes..</p></div>

<p>In gas-producers all carbonaceous
fuels are transformed into inflammable
gas. In those which (on account of their
slight density and large amount of water,
or incombustible admixtures which absorb
heat) are not as capable of giving a
high temperature in ordinary furnaces&mdash;for
instance, fir cones, peat, the lower
kinds of coal, &amp;c.&mdash;the same gas is obtained
as with the best kinds of coal,
because the water condenses on cooling,
and the ashes and earthy matter remain
in the gas-producer. The construction
of a gas-producer is seen from the accompanying
drawing. The fuel lies on
the fire-bars O, the air enters through
them and the ash-hole (drawn by the
draught of the chimney of the stove where
the gas burns, or else forced by a blowing apparatus), the quantity of air being exactly
regulated by means of valves. The gases formed are then led by the tube V, provided
with a valve, into the gas main U. The addition of fuel ought to proceed in such a way
as to prevent the generated gas escaping; hence the space A is kept filled with the combustible
material and covered with a lid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_532" id="Footnote_20_532"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_532"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> An excess of air lowers the temperature of combustion, because it becomes heated
itself, as explained in Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>. In ordinary furnaces the excess of air is three or
four times greater than the quantity required for perfect combustion. In the best
furnaces (with fire-bars, regulated air supply, and corresponding chimney draught) it is
necessary to introduce twice as much air as is necessary, otherwise the smoke contains
much carbonic oxide.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_533" id="Footnote_21_533"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_533"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> If in manufactories it is necessary, for instance, to maintain the temperature in a
furnace at 1,000°, the flame passes out at this or a higher temperature, and therefore
much fuel is lost in the smoke. For the draught of the chimney a temperature of 100°
to 150° is sufficient, and therefore the remaining heat ought to be utilised. For this
purpose the flues are carried under boilers or other heating apparatus. The preparatory
heating of the air is the best means of utilisation when a high temperature is desired (<i>see</i>
Note 22).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_534" id="Footnote_22_534"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_534"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Regenerative furnaces were introduced by the Brothers Siemens about the year
1860 in many industries, and mark a most important progress in the use of fuel, especially
in obtaining high temperatures. The principle is as follows: The products of
combustion from the furnace are led into a chamber, I, and heat up the bricks in it, and
then pass into the outlet flue; when the bricks are at a red heat the products of combustion
are passed (by altering the valves) into another adjoining chamber, II, and air
requisite for the combustion of the generator gases is passed through I. In passing round
about the incandescent bricks the air is heated, and the bricks are cooled&mdash;that is, the
heat of the smoke is returned into the furnace. The air is then passed through II, and the
smoke through I. The regenerative burners for illuminating gas are founded on this
same principle, the products of combustion heat the incoming air and gas, the temperature
is higher, the light brighter, and an economy of gas is effected. Absolute perfection
in these appliances has, of course, not yet been attained; further improvement is
still possible, but dissociation imposes a limit because at a certain high temperature
combinations do not ensue, possible temperatures being limited by reverse reactions.
Here, as in a number of other cases, the further investigation of the matter must prove
of direct value from a practical point of view.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_535" id="Footnote_23_535"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_535"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> At first sight it appears absurd, useless, and paradoxical to lose nearly one-third of the
heat which fuel can develop, by turning it into gas. Actually the advantage is enormous,
especially for producing high temperatures, as is already seen from the fact that fuels rich
in oxygen (for instance, wood) when damp are unable, with any kind of hearth whatever, to
give the temperature required for glass-melting or steel-casting, whilst in the gas-producer
they furnish exactly the same gas as the driest and most carbonaceous fuel. In order to
understand the principle which is here involved, it is sufficient to remember that a large
amount of heat, but having a low temperature, is in many cases of no use whatever. We
are unable here to enter into all the details of the complicated matter of the application
of fuel, and further particulars must be sought for in special technical treatises. The
following footnotes, however, contain certain fundamental figures for calculations concerning
combustion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_536" id="Footnote_24_536"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_536"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> The first product of combustion of charcoal is always carbonic anhydride, and not
carbonic oxide. This is seen from the fact that with a shallow layer of charcoal (less
than a decimetre if the charcoal be closely packed) carbonic oxide is not formed at all.
It is not even produced with a deep layer of charcoal if the temperature is not above 500°,
and the current of air or oxygen is very slow. With a rapid current of air the charcoal
becomes red-hot, and the temperature rises, and then carbonic oxide appears (Lang 1888).
Ernst (1891) found that below 995° carbonic oxide is always accompanied by CO<sub>2</sub>, and
that the formation of CO<sub>2</sub> begins about 400°. Naumann and Pistor determined that the
reaction of carbonic anhydride with carbon commences at about 550°, and that between
water and carbon at about 500°. At the latter temperature carbonic anhydride is formed,
and only with a rise of temperature is carbonic oxide formed (Lang) from the action of
the carbonic anhydride on the carbon, and from the reaction CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> = CO + H<sub>2</sub>O.
Rathke (1881) showed that at no temperature whatever is the reaction as expressed by the
equation CO<sub>2</sub> + C = 2CO<sub>2</sub>, complete; a part of the carbonic anhydride remains, and Lang
determined that at about 1,000° not less than 3 p.c. of the carbonic anhydride remains
untransformed into carbonic oxide, even after the action has been continued for several
hours. The endothermal reactions, C + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> +2H<sub>2</sub>, and CO + H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>,
are just as incomplete. This is made clear if we note that on the one hand the
above-mentioned reactions are all reversible, and therefore bounded by a limit; and, on
the other hand, that at about 500° oxygen begins to combine with hydrogen and carbon,
and also that the lower limits of dissociation of water, carbonic anhydride, and carbonic
oxide lie near one another between 500° and 1,200°. For water and carbonic oxide the
lower limit of the commencement of dissociation is unknown, but judging from the published
data (according to Le Chatelier, 1888) that of carbonic anhydride may be taken
as about 1,050°. Even at about 200° half the carbonic anhydride dissociates if the
pressure be small, about 0·001 atmosphere. At the atmospheric pressure, not more than
0·05 p.c. of the carbonic anhydride decomposes. The reason of the influence of pressure
is here evidently that the splitting up of carbonic anhydride into carbonic oxide and oxygen
is accompanied by an increase in volume (as in the case of the dissociation of nitric
peroxide. <i>See</i> Chapter VI., Note <a href="#Footnote_46_378">46</a>). As in stoves and lamps, and also with explosive
substances, the temperature is not higher than 2,000° to 2,500°, it is evident that although
the partial pressure of carbonic anhydride is small, still its dissociation cannot here be
considerable, and probably does not exceed 5 p.c.</p></div>

metallic nickel (obtained by heating the oxide to redness in a stream of hydrogen) is able,
when heated even to 350°, to completely decompose carbonic oxide into CO<sub>2</sub> and carbon,
which remains with the nickel and is easily removed from it by heating in a stream of
air. Here 2CO = CO<sub>2</sub> + C. It should be remarked that heat is evolved in this reaction
(Note <a href="#Footnote_25_538">25</a>), and therefore that the influence of &lsquo;contact&rsquo; may here play a part. Indeed,
this reaction must be classed among the most remarkable instances of the influence of
contact, especially as metals analogous to Ni (Fe and Co) do not effect this reaction
(<i>see</i> Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_17_141">17</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_538" id="Footnote_25_538"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_538"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> A molecular weight of this gas, or 2 volumes CO (28 grams), on combustion
(forming CO<sub>2</sub>) gives out 68,000 heat units (Thomsen 67,960 calories). A molecular weight
of hydrogen, H<sub>2</sub> (or 2 volumes), develops on burning into <i>liquid</i> water 69,000 heat units
(according to Thomsen 68,300), but if it forms aqueous vapour 58,000 heat units. Charcoal,
resolving itself by combustion into the molecular quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> (2 volumes),
develops 97,000 heat units. From the data furnished by these exothermal reactions it
follows: (1) that the oxidation of charcoal into carbonic oxide develops 29,000 heat units;
(2) that the reaction C + CO<sub>2</sub> = 2CO <i>absorbs</i> 39,000 heat units; (3) C + H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub> + CO
<i>absorbs</i> (if the water be in a state of vapour) 29,000 calories, but if the water be liquid
40,000 calories (almost as much as C + CO<sub>2</sub>); (4) C + H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub> <i>absorbs</i> (if the
water be in a state of vapour) 19,000 heat units; (5) the reaction CO + H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>
<i>develops</i> 10,000 heat units if the water be in the state of vapour; and (6) the decomposition
expressed by the equation 2CO = C + CO<sub>2</sub> (Note <a href="#Footnote_24_BIS_537">24 bis</a>) is accompanied by the <i>evolution</i>
of 39,000 units of heat.</p>

<p>Hence it follows that 2 volumes of CO or H<sub>2</sub> burning into CO<sub>2</sub> or H<sub>2</sub>O develop
almost the same amount of heat, just as also the heat effects corresponding with the
equations</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_539" id="Footnote_26_539"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_539"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> <i>Water gas</i>, obtained from steam and charcoal at a white heat, contains about 50 p.c.
of hydrogen, about 40 p.c. of carbonic oxide, about 5 p.c. of carbonic anhydride, the
remainder being nitrogen from the charcoal and air. Compared with producer gas, which
contains much nitrogen, this is a gas much richer in combustible matter, and therefore
capable of giving high temperatures, and is for this reason of the greatest utility. If carbonic
anhydride could be as readily obtained in as pure a state as water, then CO might be
prepared directly from CO<sub>2</sub> + C, and in that case the utilisation of the heat of the carbon
would be the same as in water gas, because CO evolves as much heat as H<sub>2</sub>, and even more
if the temperature of the smoke be over 100°, and the water remains in the form of vapour
(Note <a href="#Footnote_25_538">25</a>). But producer gas contains a large proportion of nitrogen, so that its effective
temperature is below that given by water gas; therefore in places where a particularly
high temperature is required (for instance, for lighting by means of incandescent lime or
magnesia, or for steel melting, &amp;c.), and where the gas can be easily distributed through
pipes, water gas is at present held in high estimation, but when (in ordinary furnaces,
re-heating, glass-melting, and other furnaces) a very high temperature is not required,
and there is no need to convey the gas in pipes, producer gas is generally preferred on
account of the simplicity of its preparation, especially as for water gas such a high
temperature is required that the plant soon becomes damaged.</p>

<p>There are numerous systems for making water gas, but the American patent of T. Lowe
is generally used. The gas is prepared in a cylindrical generator, into which hot air is
introduced, in order to raise the coke in it to a white heat. The products of combustion
containing carbonic oxide are utilised for superheating steam, which is then passed
over the white hot coke. Water gas, or a mixture of hydrogen and carbonic oxide, is
thus obtained.</p>

<p>Water gas is sometimes called &lsquo;<i>the fuel of the future</i>,&rsquo; because it is applicable to all
purposes, develops a high temperature, and is therefore available, not only for domestic
and industrial uses, but also for gas-motors and for lighting. For the latter purpose
platinum, lime, magnesia, zirconia, and similar substances (as in the Drummond light,
Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>.), are rendered incandescent in the flame, or else the gas is <i>carburetted</i>&mdash;that
is, mixed with the vapours of volatile hydrocarbons (generally benzene or naphtha,
naphthalene, or simply naphtha gas), which communicate to the pale flame of carbonic
oxide and hydrogen a great brilliancy, owing to the high temperature developed by the
combustion of the non-luminous gases. As water gas, possessing these properties, may
be prepared at central works and conveyed in pipes to the consumers, and as it may be
produced from any kind of fuel, and ought to be much cheaper than ordinary gas, it may
as a matter of fact be expected that in course of time (when experience shall have determined
the cheapest and best way to prepare it) it will not only supplant ordinary gas, but
will with advantage everywhere replace the ordinary forms of fuel, which in many respects
are inconvenient. At present its consumption spreads principally for lighting purposes,
and for use in gas-engines instead of ordinary illuminating gas. In some cases Dowson
gas is prepared in producers. This is a mixture of water and producer gases obtained
by passing steam into an ordinary producer (Note <a href="#Footnote_19_531">19</a>), when the temperature of the
carbon has become sufficiently high for the reaction C + H<sub>2</sub>O = CO + H<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

is H(COOH) and the second (COOH)<sub>2</sub>, or H<sub>2</sub> in which one or both halves of the hydrogen
are exchanged for carboxyl; therefore they are equal to H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> + 2CO<sub>2</sub>; but
H<sub>2</sub> reacts with CO<sub>2</sub>, as has been stated above, forming CO and H<sub>2</sub>O. From this it is also
evident that oxalic acid on losing CO<sub>2</sub> forms formic acid, and also that the latter may
proceed from CO + H<sub>2</sub>O, as we shall see further on.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_544" id="Footnote_29_544"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_544"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> It is remarkable that, according to the investigations of Dixon, perfectly dry
carbonic oxide does not explode with oxygen when a spark of low intensity is used, but
an explosion takes place if there is the slightest admixture of moisture. L. Meyer,
however, showed that sparks of an electric discharge of considerable intensity produce
an explosion. N. N. Beketoff demonstrated that combustion proceeds and spreads
slowly unless there be perfect dryness. I think that this may he explained by the fact
that water with carbonic oxide gives carbonic anhydride and hydrogen, but hydrogen
with oxygen gives hydrogen peroxide (Chapter <a href="#Page_299">VII</a>.), which with carbonic oxide forms
carbonic anhydride and water. The water, therefore, is renewed, and again serves the
same purpose. But it may be that here it is necessary to acknowledge a simple contact
influence. After Dixon had shown the influence of traces of moisture upon the reaction
CO + O, many researches were made of a similar nature. The fullest investigation into
the influence of moisture upon the course of many chemical reactions was made by Baker
in 1894. He showed that with perfect dryness, many chemical transformations (for
example, the formation of ozone from oxygen, the decomposition of AgO, KClO<sub>3</sub> under
the action of heat, &amp;c.) proceeds in exactly the same manner as in the presence of
moisture; but that in many cases traces of moisture have an evident influence. We may
mention the following instances: (1) Dry SO<sub>3</sub> does not act upon dry CaO or CuO; (2)
perfectly dry sal-ammoniac does not give NH<sub>3</sub> with dry CaO, but simply volatilises; (3)
dry NO and O do not react; (4) perfectly dry NH<sub>3</sub> and HCl do not combine; (5) perfectly
dry sal-ammoniac does not dissociate at 350° (Chapter VII., Note <a href="#Footnote_15_BIS_424">15 bis</a>); and (6) perfectly
dry chlorine does not act upon metals, &amp;c.</p></div>

the same way as oxygen. In addition to this, the absorption spectrum of the blood
changes so that by the help of blood it is easy to detect the slightest traces of carbonic
oxide in the air. M. A. Kapoustin found that linseed oil and therefore oil paints, are
capable of giving off carbonic oxide while drying (absorbing oxygen).</p></div>

K<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is formed, and probably K<sub>10</sub>C<sub>10</sub>O<sub>10</sub>, because products containing C<sub>10</sub> are formed
by the action of hydrochloric acid. The black mass formed by the combination of
carbonic oxide with potassium explodes with great ease, and oxidises in the air. Although

alcohol: (CHO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)OH = 2HOH + (CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. As the nearest derivatives of
ammonia, the amides treated with alkalis yield ammonia and form the salt of the acid.
The nitriles do not, however, give similar reactions so readily. The majority of amides
corresponding to acids have a composition RNH<sub>2</sub>, and therefore recombine with water with
great ease even when simply boiled with it, and with still greater facility in presence of
acids or alkalis. Under the action of alkalis the amides naturally give off ammonia,
through the combination of water with the amide, when a salt of the acid from which the
amide was derived is formed: RNH<sub>2</sub> + KHO = RKO + NH<sub>3</sub>.</p>

<p>The same reaction takes place with acids, only an ammoniacal salt of the acid is of
course formed whilst the acid held in the amide is liberated: RNH<sub>2</sub> + HCl + H<sub>2</sub>O
= RHO + NH<sub>4</sub>Cl.</p>

<p>Thus in the majority of cases amides easily pass into ammoniacal salts, but they
differ essentially from them. No ammoniacal salt sublimes or volatilises unchanged, and
generally when heated it gives off water and yields an amide, whilst many amides volatilise
without alteration and frequently are volatile crystalline substances which may be
easily sublimed. Such, for instance, are the amides of benzoic, formic, and many
other organic acids.</p></div>

warm would absorb less water. The mixture of hydrocyanic acid and aqueous vapour
on passing over a long layer of calcium chloride gives up water, and hydrocyanic acid
alone remains in the vapour. It ought to be cooled as carefully as possible in order to
bring it into a liquid condition. The method which Gay-Lussac employed for obtaining
pure hydrocyanic acid consisted in the action of hydrochloric acid gas on mercuric
cyanide. The latter may he obtained in a pure state if a solution of yellow prussiate be
boiled with a solution of mercuric nitrate, filtered, and crystallised by cooling; the
mercuric cyanide is then obtained in the form of colourless crystals, Hg(CN)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

of vapours evolved, consisting of aqueous vapour, hydrochloric acid, and hydrocyanic

In order to obtain the latter in an anhydrous form, the decomposition
of heated mercury cyanide by hydrogen sulphide may be made use of. Here the sulphur

has poisonous effects. Perfectly pure anhydrous hydrocyanic acid keeps without change,

<p>One, two, three, and four atoms of hydrogen enter into these
molecules for one atom of another element. No compounds of one atom
of oxygen with three or four atoms of hydrogen are known; hence the
atom of oxygen does not possess certain properties which are found in
the atoms of carbon and nitrogen.</p>

<p>The faculty of an element to form a compound of definite composition
with hydrogen (or an element analogous to it) gives the possibility
of foretelling the composition of many other of its compounds. Thus,
if we know that an element, M, combines with hydrogen, forming,
by preference, a gaseous substance such as HM, but not forming
H<sub>2</sub>M, H<sub>3</sub>M, H<sub>n</sub>M<sub>m</sub>, then we must conclude, on the basis of the law of
substitution, that this element will give compounds M<sub>2</sub>O, M<sub>3</sub>N, MHO,
MH<sub>3</sub>C, &amp;c. Chlorine is an example of this kind. If we know that
another element, R, like oxygen, gives with hydrogen a molecule H<sub>2</sub>R,
then we may expect that it will form compounds similar to hydrogen
peroxide, the metallic oxides, carbonic anhydride, or carbonic oxide,
and others. Sulphur is an instance of this kind. Hence the elements
may be classified according to their resemblance to hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, and carbon, and in conformity with this analogy it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span>
to foretell, if not the properties (for example, the acidity or basicity),
at any rate the composition,<a name="FNanchor_1_568" id="FNanchor_1_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_568" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of some of their compounds. This forms
the substance of <i>the conception of the valency or atomicity of the elements</i>.
Hydrogen is taken as the representative of the univalent elements,
giving compounds, RH, R(OH), R<sub>2</sub>O, RCl, R<sub>3</sub>N, R<sub>4</sub>C, &amp;c. Oxygen,
in that form in which it gives water, is the representative of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
bivalent elements, forming RH<sub>2</sub>, RO, RCl<sub>2</sub>, RHCl, R(OH)Cl, R(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
R<sub>2</sub>C, RCN, &amp;c. Nitrogen in ammonia is the representative of the
trivalent elements, giving compounds RH<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, R(OH)<sub>3</sub>, RCl<sub>3</sub>, RN,
RHC, &amp;c. In carbon are exemplified the properties of the quadrivalent
elements, forming RH<sub>4</sub>, RO<sub>2</sub>, RO(OH)<sub>2</sub>, R(OH)<sub>4</sub>, RHN, RCl<sub>4</sub>, RHCl<sub>3</sub>,
&amp;c. We meet with these <i>forms of combination</i>, or degrees of union of
atoms, in all other elements, some being analogous to hydrogen, others to
oxygen, and others to nitrogen or to carbon. But besides these quantitative
analogies or resemblances, which are foretold by the law of
substitution (Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>.), there exist among the elements qualitative
analogies and relations which are not fully seen in the compounds
of the elements which have been considered, but are most distinctly
exhibited in the formation of bases, acids, and salts of different types
and properties. Therefore, for a complete study of the nature of the
elements and their compounds it is especially important to become
acquainted with the salts, as substances of a peculiar character, and
with the corresponding acids and bases. Common table salt, or sodium
chloride, NaCl, may in every respect be taken as a type of salts in
general, and we will therefore pass to the consideration of this substance,
and of hydrochloric acid, and of the base sodium hydroxide,
formed by the non-metal chlorine and the metal sodium, which correspond
with it.</p>

<p><i>Sodium chloride</i>, NaCl, the familiar table salt, occurs, although
in very small quantities, in all the primary formations of the earth's
crust,<a name="FNanchor_2_569" id="FNanchor_2_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_569" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> from which it is washed away by the atmospheric waters; it is
contained in small quantities in all waters flowing through these formations,
and is in this manner conveyed to the oceans and seas. The
immense mass of salt in the oceans has been accumulated by this process
from the remote ages of the earth's creation, because the water has
evaporated from them while the salt has remained in solution. The salt
of sea water serves as the source not only for its direct extraction, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
also for the formation of other masses of workable salt, such as rock
salt, and of saline springs and lakes.<a name="FNanchor_2_BIS_570" id="FNanchor_2_BIS_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_BIS_570" class="fnanchor">[2 bis]</a></p>

<p>The extraction of salt <i>from sea water</i> is carried on in several ways.
In southern climes, especially on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and the
Mediterranean and Black Seas, the summer heats are taken advantage
of. A convenient low-lying sea shore is chosen, and a whole series of
basins, communicating with each other, are constructed along it. The
upper of these basins are filled with sea water by pumping, or else
advantage is taken of high tides. These basins are sometimes separated
from the sea by natural sand-banks (limans) or by artificial means, and
in spring the water already begins to evaporate considerably. As the
solution becomes more concentrated, it is run into the succeeding basins,
and the upper ones are supplied with a fresh quantity of sea water, or
else an arrangement is made enabling the salt water to flow by degrees
through the series of basins. It is evident that the beds of the basins
should be as far as possible impervious to water, and for this purpose
they are made of beaten clay. The crystals of salt begin to separate
out when the concentration attains 28 p.c. of salt (which corresponds
to 28° of Baumé's hydrometer). They are raked off, and employed
for all those purposes to which table salt is applicable. In the majority
of cases only the first half of the sodium chloride which can be separated
from the sea water is extracted, because the second half has a bitter
taste from the presence of magnesium salts which separate out together
with the sodium salt. But in certain localities&mdash;as, for instance, in the
estuary of the Rhone, on the island of Camarga<a name="FNanchor_3_571" id="FNanchor_3_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_571" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;the evaporation is
carried on to the very end, in order to obtain those magnesium and
potassium salts which separate out at the end of the evaporation of sea
water. Various salts are separated from sea water in its evaporation.
From 100 parts of sea water there separates out, by natural and artificial
evaporation, about one part of tolerably pure table salt at the
very commencement of the operation; the total amount held in solution
being about 2&frac12; p.c. The remaining portion separates out intermixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
with the bitter salts of magnesium which, owing to their solubility
and the small amount in which they are present (less than
1 p.c.), only separate out, in the first crystallisations, in traces.
Gypsum, or calcium sulphate, CaSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, because of its sparing
solubility, separates together with or even before the table salt. When
about half of the latter has separated, then a mixture of table salt
and magnesium sulphate separates out, and on still further evaporation
the chlorides of potassium and magnesium begin to separate
in a state of combination, forming the double salt KMgCl<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O,
which occurs in nature as <i>carnallite</i>.<a name="FNanchor_4_572" id="FNanchor_4_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_572" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> After the separation of this
salt from sea water, there remains a mother liquor containing a
large amount of magnesium chloride in admixture with various
other salts.<a name="FNanchor_5_573" id="FNanchor_5_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_573" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The extraction of sea salt is usually carried on for the
purpose of procuring table salt, and therefore directly it begins to
separate mixed with a considerable proportion<a name="FNanchor_6_574" id="FNanchor_6_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_574" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> of magnesium salts
(when it acquires a bitter taste) the remaining liquor is run back into
the sea.</p>

<p>The same process which is employed for artificially obtaining salt
in a crystalline form from sea water has been repeatedly accomplished
during the geological evolution of the earth on a gigantic scale; upheavals
of the earth have cut off portions of the sea from the remainder
(as the Dead Sea was formerly a part of the Mediterranean, and the Sea
of Aral of the Caspian), and their water has evaporated and formed
(if the mass of the inflowing fresh water were less than that of the
mass evaporated) deposits of <i>rock salt</i>. It is always accompanied by
gypsum, because the latter is separated from sea water with or before
the sodium chloride. For this reason rock salt may always be looked for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
in those localities where there are deposits of gypsum. But inasmuch
as the gypsum remains on the spot where it has been deposited (as
it is a sparingly soluble salt), whilst the rock salt (as one which is very
soluble) may be washed away by rain or fresh running water, it may
sometimes happen that although gypsum is still found there may be
no salt; but, on the other hand, where there is rock salt there will
always be gypsum. As the geological changes of the earth's surface
are still proceeding at the present day, so in the midst of the dry land
salt lakes are met with, which are sometimes scattered over vast districts
formerly covered by seas now dried up. Such is the origin of
many of the salt lakes about the lower portions of the Volga and in the
Kirghiz steppes, where at a geological epoch preceding the present the
Aralo-Caspian Sea extended. Such are the Baskunchaksky (in the
Government of Astrakhan, 112 square kilometres superficial area), the
Eltonsky (140 versts from the left bank of the Volga, and 200 square
kilometres in superficial area), and upward of 700 other salt lakes
lying about the lower portions of the Volga. In those in which the
inflow of fresh water is less than that yearly evaporated, and in which
the concentration of the solution has reached saturation, the <i>self-deposited</i>
salt is found already deposited on their beds, or is being yearly
deposited during the summer months. Certain limans, or sea-side lakes,
of the Azoff Sea are essentially of the same character&mdash;as, for instance,
those in the neighbourhood of Henichesk and Berdiansk. The saline
soils of certain Central Asian steppes, which suffer from a want of
atmospheric fresh water, are of the same origin. Their salt originally
proceeded from the salt of seas which previously covered these localities,
and has not yet been washed away by fresh water. The main result of
the above-described process of nature is the formation of masses of rock
salt, which are, however, being gradually washed away by the subsoil
waters flowing in their neighbourhood, and afterwards rising to the
surface in certain places as <i>saline springs</i>, which indicate the presence
of masses of deposited rock salt in the depths of the earth. If the subsoil
water flows along a stratum of salt for a sufficient length of time it
becomes saturated; but in flowing in its further course along an impervious
stratum (clay) it becomes diluted by the fresh water leaking
through the upper soil, and therefore the greater the distance of a
saline spring from the deposit of rock salt, the poorer will it be in
salt. A perfectly saturated brine, however, may be procured from the
depths of the earth by means of bore-holes. The deposits of rock salt
themselves, which are sometimes hidden at great depths below the
earth's strata, may be discovered by the guidance of bore-holes and the
direction of the strata of the district. Deposits of rock salt, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
35 metres thick and 20 metres below the surface, were discovered in this
manner in the neighbourhood of Brianstcheffky and Dekonoffky, in
the Bakhmut district of the Government of Ekaterinoslav. Large
quantities of most excellent rock salt are now (since 1880) obtained from
these deposits, whose presence was indicated by the neighbouring salt
springs (near Slaviansk and Bakhmut) and by bore-holes which had been
sunk in these localities for procuring strong (saturated) brines. But
the Stassfurt deposits of rock salt near Magdeburg in Germany are
celebrated as being the first discovered in this manner, and for their
many remarkable peculiarities.<a name="FNanchor_7_575" id="FNanchor_7_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_575" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The plentiful distribution of saline
springs in this and the neighbouring districts suggested the presence
of deposits of rock salt in the vicinity. Deep bore-holes sunk in
this locality did in fact give a richer brine&mdash;even quite saturated
with salt. On sinking to a still greater depth, the deposits of salt
themselves were at last arrived at. But the first deposit which was
met with consisted of a bitter salt unfit for consumption, and was
therefore called refuse salt (<i>Abraumsalz</i>). On sinking still deeper vast
beds of real rock salt were struck. In this instance the presence of
these upper strata containing salts of potassium, magnesium, and
sodium is an excellent proof of the formation of rock salt from sea water.
It is very evident that not only a case of evaporation to the end&mdash;as far,
for instance, as the separation of carnallite&mdash;but also the preservation
of such soluble salts as separate out from sea water after the sodium
chloride, must be a very exceptional phenomenon, which is not repeated
in all deposits of rock salt. The Stassfurt deposits therefore are of
particular interest, not only from a scientific point of view, but also
because they form a rich source of potassium salts which have many
practical uses.<a name="FNanchor_7_BIS_576" id="FNanchor_7_BIS_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_BIS_576" class="fnanchor">[7 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span></p>

<p>A saturated brine, formed by the continued contact of subsoil
water with rock salt, is extracted by means of bore-holes, as, for
instance, in the Governments of Perm, Kharkoff, and Ekaterinoslav.
Sometimes, as at Berchtesgaden (and at Hallein) in Austria, spring
water is run on to underground beds of rock salt containing much clay.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 64.&mdash;Graduator for the evaporation of the water of saline springs.</p></div>

<p>If a saline spring, or the salt water pumped from bore-holes, contains
but little salt, then the first concentration of the natural solution
is not carried on by the costly consumption of fuel, but by the cheaper
method of evaporation by means of the wind. For this purpose
so-called graduators are constructed: they consist of long and lofty
sheds, which are sometimes several versts long, and generally extend
in a direction at right angles to that of the usual course of the wind in
the district. These sheds are open at the sides, and are filled with
brushwood as shown in fig. <a href="#fig_64">64</a>. Troughs, <span class="smcap">A B</span>, <span class="smcap">C D</span>, into which the salt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
water is pumped, run along the top. On flowing from these troughs,
through the openings, <i>a</i>, the water spreads over the brushwood and
distributes itself in a thin layer over it, so that it presents a very large
surface for evaporation, in consequence of which it rapidly becomes
concentrated in warm or windy weather. After trickling over the
brushwood, the solution collects in a reservoir under the graduator,
whence it is usually pumped up by the pumps <span class="smcap">P P</span>&#8242;, and again run a
second and third time through the graduator, until the solution reaches
a degree of concentration at which it becomes profitable to extract
the salt by direct heating. Generally the evaporation in the graduator
is not carried beyond a concentration of 12 to 15 parts of salt in
100 parts of solution. Strong natural solutions of salt, and also the
graduated solutions, are evaporated in large shallow metallic vessels,
which are either heated by the direct action of the flame from below
or from above. These vessels are made of boiler plate, and are called
salt-pans. Various means are employed for accelerating the evaporation
and for economising fuel, which are mainly based on an artificial
draught to carry off the steam as it is formed, and on subjecting the
saline solution to a preliminary heating by the waste heat of the steam
and furnace gases. Furthermore, the first portions of the salt which
crystallise out in the salt-pans are invariably contaminated with gypsum,
since the waters of saline springs always contain this substance. It is
only the portions of the salt which separate later that are distinguished
by their great purity. The salt is ladled out as it is deposited, left to
drain on inclined tables and then dried, and in this manner the so-called
bay salt is obtained. Since it has become possible to discover
the saline deposits themselves, the extraction of table salt from the
water of saline springs by evaporation, which previously was in general
use, has begun to be disused, and is only able to hold its ground in
places where fuel is cheap.</p>

<p>In order to understand the full importance of the extraction of
salt, it need only be mentioned that on the average 20 lbs. of table salt
are consumed yearly per head of population, directly in food or for cattle.
In those countries where common salt is employed in technical processes,
and especially in England, almost an equal quantity is consumed
in the production of substances containing chlorine and sodium, and
especially in the manufacture of washing soda, &amp;c., and of chlorine
compounds (bleaching powder and hydrochloric acid). The yearly production
of salt in Europe amounts to as much as 7&frac12; million tons.</p>

<p>Although certain lumps of rock salt and crystals of bay salt sometimes
consist of almost pure sodium chloride, still the ordinary commercial
salt contains various impurities, the most common of which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
magnesium salts. If the salt be pure, its solution gives no precipitate
with sodium carbonate, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, showing the absence of magnesium
salts, because magnesium carbonate, MgCO<sub>3</sub>, is insoluble in water.
Rock salt, which is ground for use, generally contains also a considerable
admixture of clay and other insoluble impurities.<a name="FNanchor_8_577" id="FNanchor_8_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_577" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> For ordinary use
the bulk of the salt obtained can be employed directly without further
purification; but some salts are purified by solution and crystallisation
of the solution after standing, in which case the evaporation is not carried
on to dryness, and the impurities remain in the <i>mother liquor</i> or
in the sediment. When perfectly pure salt is required for chemical
purposes it is best obtained as follows: a saturated solution of table
salt is prepared, and hydrochloric acid gas is passed through it; this
precipitates the sodium chloride (which is not soluble in a strong solution
of hydrochloric acid), while the impurities remain in solution. By
repeating the operation and fusing the salt (when adhering hydrochloric
acid is volatilised) a pure salt is obtained, which is again
crystallised from its solution by evaporation.<a name="FNanchor_9_578" id="FNanchor_9_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_578" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Pure sodium chloride, in well-defined crystals (slowly deposited
at the bottom of the liquid) or in compact masses (in which form rock
salt is sometimes met with), is a colourless and transparent substance
resembling, but more brittle and less hard than, glass.<a name="FNanchor_10_579" id="FNanchor_10_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_579" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Common
salt always crystallises in the cubic system, most frequently in <i>cubes</i>,
and more rarely in octahedra. Large transparent cubes of common
salt, having edges up to 10 centimetres long, are sometimes found in
masses of rock salt.<a name="FNanchor_11_580" id="FNanchor_11_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_580" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> When evaporated in the open the salt often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
separates out on the surface<a name="FNanchor_12_581" id="FNanchor_12_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_581" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> as cubes, which grow on to each other
in the form of pyramidal square funnels. In still weather, these
clusters are able to support themselves on the surface of the water for
a long time, and sometimes go on increasing to a considerable extent,
but they sink directly the water penetrates inside them. Salt fuses
to a colourless liquid (sp. gr. 1·602, according to Quincke) at 851°
(V. Meyer); if pure it solidifies to a non-crystalline mass, and if impure
to an opaque mass whose surface is not smooth. In fusing, sodium
chloride commences to volatilise (its weight decreases) and at a white
heat it volatilises with great ease and completely; but at the ordinary
temperature it may, like all ordinary salts, be considered as non-volatile,
although as yet no exact experiments have been made in this direction.</p>

<p>A saturated<a name="FNanchor_13_582" id="FNanchor_13_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_582" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> solution of table salt (containing 26·4 p.c.) has at
the ordinary temperature a specific gravity of about 1·2. The specific
gravity of the crystals is 2·167 (17°). The salt which separates out
at the ordinary and higher temperatures contains no water of crystallisation;<a name="FNanchor_14_583" id="FNanchor_14_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_583" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
but if the crystals are formed at a low temperature,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
especially from a saturated solution cooled to -12°, then they present
a prismatic form, and contain two equivalents of water, NaCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O.
At the ordinary temperature these crystals split up into sodium
chloride and its solution.<a name="FNanchor_15_584" id="FNanchor_15_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_584" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Unsaturated solutions of table salt when
cooled below 0° give<a name="FNanchor_16_585" id="FNanchor_16_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_585" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> crystals of ice, but when the solution has a
composition NaCl,10H<sub>2</sub>O it solidifies completely at a temperature of
-23°. A solution of table salt saturated at its boiling point boils at
about 109°, and contains about 42 parts of salt per 100 parts of water.</p>

<p>Of all its physical properties the specific gravity of solutions of
sodium chloride is the one which has been the most fully investigated.
A comparison of all the existing determinations of the specific gravity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>

that it is expressed by the equation S<sub>15</sub> = 9991·6 + 71·17<i>p</i> + 0·2140<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>.
For instance, for a solution 200H<sub>2</sub>O + NaCl, in which case <i>p</i> = 1·6,
S<sub>15</sub> = 1·0106. It is seen from the formula that the addition of water

<p>It should be remarked that Baumé's hydrometer is graduated by
taking a 10 p.c. solution of sodium chloride as 10° on the scale, and
therefore it gives approximately the percentage amount of the salt in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
solution. Common salt is somewhat soluble in alcohol,<a name="FNanchor_21_590" id="FNanchor_21_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_590" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> but it is
insoluble in ether and in oils.</p>

<p>Common salt gives very few compounds<a name="FNanchor_22_591" id="FNanchor_22_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_591" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> (double salts) and these
are very readily decomposed: it is also decomposed with great difficulty
and its dissociation is unknown.<a name="FNanchor_23_592" id="FNanchor_23_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_592" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> But it is easily decomposed, both
when fused and in solution, by the action of a galvanic current. If the
dry salt be fused in a crucible and an electric current be passed through
it by immersing carbon or platinum electrodes in it (the positive electrode
is made of carbon and the negative of platinum or mercury), it is
<i>decomposed</i>: the suffocating gas, chlorine, is liberated at the positive
pole and metallic sodium at the negative pole. Both of them act on the
excess of water at the moment of their evolution; the sodium evolves
hydrogen and forms caustic soda, and the chlorine evolves oxygen and
forms hydrochloric acid, and therefore on passing a current through a
solution of common salt metallic sodium will not be obtained&mdash;but
oxygen, chlorine, and hydrochloric acid will appear at the positive
pole, and hydrogen and caustic soda at the negative pole.<a name="FNanchor_23_BIS_593" id="FNanchor_23_BIS_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_BIS_593" class="fnanchor">[23 bis]</a> Thus
salt, like other salts, is decomposed by the action of an electric current
into a metal and a haloid (Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>.) Naturally, like all other
salts, it may be formed from the corresponding base and acid with
the separation of water. In fact if we mix caustic soda (base)
with hydrochloric acid (acid), table salt is formed, NaHO + HCl
= NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>With respect to the double decompositions of sodium chloride it
should be observed that they are most varied, and serve as means
of obtaining nearly all the other compounds of sodium and chlorine.</p>

<p><i>The double decompositions of sodium chloride</i> are almost exclusively
based on the possibility of the metal sodium being exchanged for
hydrogen and other metals. But neither hydrogen nor any other metal
can directly displace the sodium from sodium chloride. This would
result in the separation of metallic sodium, which itself displaces
hydrogen and the majority of other metals from their compounds, and
is not, so far as is known, ever separated by them. The replacement
of the sodium in sodium chloride by hydrogen and various metals
can only take place by the transference of the sodium into some
other combination. If hydrogen or a metal, M, be combined with an
element X, then the double decomposition NaCl + MX = NaX + MCl
takes place. Such double decompositions take place under special
conditions, sometimes completely and sometimes only partially, as
we shall endeavour to explain. In order to acquaint ourselves with
the double decompositions of sodium chloride, we will follow the
methods actually employed in practice to procure compounds of
sodium and of chlorine from common salt. For this purpose we
will first describe the treatment of sodium chloride with sulphuric
acid for the preparation of hydrochloric acid and sodium sulphate.
We will then describe the substances obtained from hydrochloric acid
and sodium sulphate. Chlorine itself, and nearly all the compounds
of this element, may be procured from hydrochloric acid, whilst sodium
carbonate, caustic soda, metallic sodium itself and all its compounds,
may be obtained from sodium sulphate.</p>

<p>Even in the animal organism salt undergoes similar changes,
furnishing the sodium, alkali, and hydrochloric acid which take part in
the processes of animal life.</p>

<p>Its necessity as a constituent in the food both of human beings and
of animals becomes evident when we consider that both hydrochloric
acid and salts of sodium are found in the substances which are separated
out from the blood into the stomach and intestines. Sodium salts
are found in the blood and in the bile which is elaborated in the
liver and acts on the food in the alimentary canal, whilst hydrochloric
acid is found in the acid juices of the stomach. Chlorides of the
metals are always found in considerable quantities in the urine, and if
they are excreted they must be replenished in the organism; and for
the replenishment of the loss, substances containing chlorine compounds
must be taken in food. Not only do animals consume those small
amounts of sodium chloride which are found in drinking water or in plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
or other animals, but experience has shown that many wild animals travel
long distances in search of salt springs, and that domestic animals
which in their natural condition do not require salt, willingly take
it, and that the functions of their organisms become much more regular
from their doing so.</p>

<p><i>The action of sulphuric acid on sodium chloride.</i>&mdash;If sulphuric acid
be poured over common salt, then even at the ordinary temperature, as
Glauber observed, an odorous gas, hydrochloric acid, is evolved. The
reaction which takes place consists in the sodium of the salt and the
hydrogen of the sulphuric acid changing places.</p>

<p>At the ordinary temperature this reaction is not complete, but soon
ceases. When the mixture is heated, the decomposition proceeds
until, if there be sufficient salt present, all the sulphuric acid taken is
converted into acid sodium sulphate. Any excess of acid will remain
unaltered. If 2 molecules of sodium chloride (117 parts) be taken
per molecule of sulphuric acid (98 parts), then on heating the mixture
to a moderate temperature only one-half (58·5) of the salt will suffer
change. Complete decomposition, after which neither hydrogen nor
chlorine is left in the residue, proceeds (when 117 parts of table salt
are taken per 98 parts of sulphuric acid) <i>at a red heat only</i>. Then&mdash;</p>

since it contains hydrogen, itself acts like an acid, NaCl + NaHSO<sub>4</sub>
= HCl + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. By adding this equation to the first we obtain
the second, which expresses the ultimate reaction. Hence in the above
reaction, non-volatile or sparingly volatile table salt and sparingly
volatile sulphuric acid are taken, and as the result of their reaction,
after the hydrogen and sodium have exchanged places, there is obtained
non-volatile sodium sulphate and gaseous hydrochloric acid. The fact
of the latter being a gaseous substance forms the main reason for the
reaction proceeding to the very end. The mechanism of this kind of
double decomposition, and the cause of the course of the reaction, are
exactly the same as those we saw in the decomposition of nitre
(Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>.) by the action of sulphuric acid. The sulphuric acid in
each case displaces the other, volatile, acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only in these two instances, but in every instance, if a volatile acid
can be formed by the substitution of the hydrogen of sulphuric acid for
a metal, then this volatile acid will be formed. From this it may be
concluded that the volatility of the acid should be considered as the
cause of the progress of the reaction; and indeed if the acid be soluble
but not volatile, or if the reaction take place in an enclosed space
where the resulting acid cannot volatilise, or at the ordinary temperature
when it does not pass into the state of elastic vapour&mdash;then the
decomposition does not proceed to the end, but only up to a certain
limit. In this respect the explanations given at the beginning of this
century by the French chemist Berthollet in his work &lsquo;Essai de Statique
Chimique&rsquo; are very important. <i>The doctrine of Berthollet</i> starts from
the supposition that the chemical reaction of substances is determined
not only by the degrees of affinity between the different parts, but also
by the relative masses of the reacting substances and by those physical
conditions under which the reaction takes place. Two substances
containing the elements MX and NY, being brought into contact
with each other, form by double decomposition the compounds MY and
NX; but the formation of these two new compounds will not proceed
to the end unless one of them is removed from the sphere of action.
But it can only be removed if it possesses different physical properties
from those of the other substances which are present with it. Either it
must be a gas while the others are liquid or solid, or an insoluble solid
while the others are liquid or soluble. The relative amounts of the
resultant substances, if nothing separates out from their intermixture,
depend only on the relative quantities of the substances MX and NY,
and upon the degrees of attraction existing between the elements M,
N, X, and Y; but however great their mass may be, and however considerable
the attractions, still in any case if nothing separates out from
the sphere of action the decomposition will presently cease, a state of
equilibrium will be established, and instead of two there will remain four
substances in the mass: namely, a portion of the original bodies MX and
NY, and a certain quantity of the newly formed substances MY and NX,
if it be assumed that neither MN or XY nor any other substances
are produced, and this may for the present<a name="FNanchor_24_594" id="FNanchor_24_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_594" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> be admitted in the case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
the double decomposition of salts in which M and X are metals and
X and Y haloids. As the ordinary double decomposition here consists
merely in the exchange of metals, the above simplification is applicable.
The sum total of existing data concerning the double decomposition of
salts leads to the conclusion that from salts MX + NY there always
arises a certain quantity of NX and MY, as should be the case
according to Berthollet's doctrine. A portion of the historical data
concerning this subject will be afterwards mentioned, but we will at
once proceed to point out the observations made by Spring (1888) which
show that <i>even in a solid state</i> salts are subject to a similar interchange
of metals if in a condition of sufficiently close contact (it requires
time, a finely divided state, and intimate mixture). Spring took two
non-hygroscopic salts, potassium nitrate, KNO<sub>3</sub>, and well-dried sodium
acetate, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>NaO<sub>2</sub>, and left a mixture of their powders for several
months in a desiccator. An interchange of metals took place, as was
seen from the fact that the resultant mass rapidly attracted the
moisture of the air, owing to the formation of sodium nitrate, NaNO<sub>3</sub>,
and potassium acetate, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>KO<sub>2</sub>, both of which are highly hygroscopic.<a name="FNanchor_24_BIS_595" id="FNanchor_24_BIS_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_BIS_595" class="fnanchor">[24 bis]</a></p>

<p>When Berthollet enunciated his doctrine the present views of atoms
and molecules had yet to be developed, and it is now necessary to submit
the matter to examination in the light of these conceptions; we will
therefore consider the reaction of salts, taking M and N, X and Y as
equivalent to each other&mdash;that is, as capable of replacing each other
&lsquo;in toto,&rsquo; as Na or K,, &frac12;Ca or &frac12;Mg (bivalent elements) replace hydrogen.</p>

<p>And since, according to Berthollet's doctrine, when <i>m</i>MX of one
salt comes into contact with <i>n</i>NY of another salt, a certain quantity
<i>x</i>MY and <i>x</i>NX is formed, there remains <i>m</i> - <i>x</i> of the salt MX, and
<i>n</i> - <i>x</i> of the salt NY. If <i>m</i> be greater than <i>n</i>, then the maximum
interchange could lead to <i>x</i> = <i>n</i>, whilst from the salts taken there
would be formed <i>n</i>MY + <i>n</i>NX + (<i>m</i> - <i>n</i>)MX&mdash;that is, a portion of one
only of the salts taken would remain unchanged because the reaction
could only proceed between <i>n</i>MX and <i>n</i>NY. If <i>x</i> were actually equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
to <i>n</i>, the mass of the salt MX would not have any influence on the
<i>modus operandi</i> of the reaction, which is equally in accordance with
the teaching of Bergmann, who supposed double reactions to be independent
of the mass and determined by affinity only. If M had more
affinity for X than for Y, and N more affinity for Y than for X, then
according to Bergmann there would be no decomposition whatever, and
<i>x</i> would equal 0. If the affinity of M for Y and of N for X were greater
than those in the original grouping, then the affinity of M for X and of N
for Y would be overcome, and, according to Bergmann's doctrine, complete
interchange would take place&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> <i>x</i> would equal <i>n</i>. According to
Berthollet's teaching, a distribution of M and N between X and Y will
take place in every case, not only in proportion to the degrees of
affinity, but also in proportion to the masses, so that with a small affinity
and a large mass the same action can be produced as with a large affinity
and a small mass. Therefore, (1) <i>x</i> will always be less than <i>n</i> and
their ratio

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>x</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span>
</span>


less than unity&mdash;that is, the decomposition will be expressed
by the equation, <i>m</i>MX + <i>n</i>NY = (<i>m</i> - <i>x</i>)MX + (<i>n</i> - <i>x</i>)NY
+ <i>x</i>MY + <i>x</i>NX; (2) by increasing the mass <i>m</i> we increase the decomposition&mdash;that
is, we increase <i>x</i> and the ratio

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>x</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">(<i>n</i> - <i>x</i>)</span>
</span>,

until with
an infinitely large quantity m the fraction

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>x</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span>
</span>

will equal 1, and the decomposition
will be complete, however small the affinities uniting MY
and NX may be; and (3) if <i>m</i> = <i>n</i>, by taking MX + NY or MY + NX
we arrive at one and the same system <i>in either case</i>: (<i>n</i> - <i>x</i>)MX
+ (<i>n</i> - <i>x</i>)NY + <i>x</i>MY + <i>x</i>NX. These direct consequences of Berthollet's
teaching are verified by experience. Thus, for example, a
mixture of solutions of sodium nitrate and potassium chloride in all
cases has entirely the same properties as a mixture of solutions of
potassium nitrate and sodium chloride, of course on condition that the
mixed solutions are of identical elementary composition. But this
identity of properties might either proceed from one system of salts
passing entirely into the other (Bergmann's hypothesis) in conformity
with the predominating affinities (for instance, from KCl + NaNO<sub>3</sub>
there might arise KNO<sub>3</sub> + NaCl, if it be admitted that the affinities of
the elements as combined in the latter system are greater than in the
former); or, on the other hand, it might be because both systems by
the interchange of a portion of their elements give one and the same
state of equilibrium, as according to Berthollet's teaching. Experiment
proves the latter hypothesis to be the true one. But before
citing the most historically important experiments verifying Berthollet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
doctrine, we must stop to consider the conception <i>of the mass</i> of the
reacting substances. Berthollet understood by mass the actual relative
quantity of a substance; but now it is impossible to understand
this term otherwise than as the number of molecules, for they act as
chemical units, and in the special case of double saline decompositions it
is better to take it as the number of equivalents. Thus in the reaction
NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> the salt is taken in one equivalent and the acid in
two. If 2NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> act, then the number of equivalents are equal,
and so on. The <i>influence of mass</i> on the amount of decomposition

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>x</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span>
</span>

forms the root of Berthollet's doctrine, and therefore we will first of
all turn our attention to the establishment of this principle in relation
to the double decomposition of salts.</p>

<p>About 1840 H. Rose<a name="FNanchor_25_596" id="FNanchor_25_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_596" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> showed that water decomposes metallic sulphides
like calcium sulphide, CaS, forming hydrogen sulphide, H<sub>2</sub>S,
notwithstanding the fact that the affinity of hydrogen sulphide, as an
acid, for lime, CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, as a base, causes them to react on each other,
forming calcium sulphide and water, CaS + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. Furthermore, Rose
showed that the greater the amount of water acting on the calcium
sulphide, the more complete is the decomposition. The results of this
reaction are evident from the fact that the hydrogen sulphide formed
may be expelled from the solution by heating, and that the resulting
lime is sparingly soluble in water. Rose clearly saw from this that
such feeble agents, in a chemical sense, as carbonic anhydride and
water, by acting in a mass and for long periods of time in nature on
the durable rocks, which resist the action of the most powerful acids,
are able to bring about chemical change&mdash;to extract, for example, from
rocks the bases, lime, soda, potash. The influence of the mass of water
on antimonious chloride, bismuth nitrate, &amp;c., is essentially of the same
character. These substances give up to the water a quantity of acid which
is greater in proportion as the mass of the water acting on them is
greater.<a name="FNanchor_25_BIS_597" id="FNanchor_25_BIS_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_BIS_597" class="fnanchor">[25 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span></p>

<p>Barium sulphate, BaSO<sub>4</sub>, which is insoluble in water, when fused
with sodium carbonate, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, gives, but not completely, barium
carbonate, BaCO<sub>3</sub>, (also insoluble), and sodium sulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. If a
solution of sodium carbonate acts on precipitated barium sulphate,
the same decomposition is also effected (Dulong, Rose), but it is
restricted by a limit and requires time. A mixture of sodium carbonate
and sulphate is obtained in the solution and a mixture of barium carbonate
and sulphate in the precipitate. If the solution be decanted off
and a fresh solution of sodium carbonate be poured over the precipitate,
then a fresh portion of the barium sulphate passes into barium carbonate,
and so by increasing the mass of sodium carbonate it is possible to
entirely convert the barium sulphate into barium carbonate. If a
definite quantity of sodium sulphate be added to the solution of sodium
carbonate, then the latter will have no action whatever on
the barium sulphate, because then a system in equilibrium determined
by the reverse action of the sodium sulphate on the barium
carbonate and by the presence of both sodium carbonate and sulphate in
the solution, is at once arrived at. On the other hand, if the mass of
the sodium sulphate in the solution be great, then the barium carbonate
is reconverted into sulphate until a definite state of equilibrium is
attained between the two opposite reactions, producing barium carbonate
by the action of the sodium carbonate and barium sulphate by the action
of the sodium sulphate.</p>

<p>Another most important principle of Berthollet's teaching is
the existence of <i>a limit of exchange decomposition</i>, or <i>the attainment
of a state of equilibrium</i>. In this respect the determinations of
Malaguti (1857) are historically the most important. He took a
mixture of solutions of equivalent quantities of two salts, MX and
NY, and judged the amount of the resulting exchange from the
composition of the precipitate produced by the addition of alcohol.
When, for example, zinc sulphate and sodium chloride (ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and
2NaCl) were taken, there were produced by exchange sodium sulphate
and zinc chloride. A mixture of zinc sulphate and sodium
sulphate was precipitated by an excess of alcohol, and it appeared
from the composition of the precipitate that 72 per cent. of the salts
taken had been decomposed. When, however, a mixture of solutions
of sodium sulphate and zinc chloride was taken, the precipitate presented
the same composition as before&mdash;that is, about 28 per cent. of the
salts taken had been subjected to decomposition. In a similar experiment
with a mixture of sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate,
2NaCl + MgSO<sub>4</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, about half of the metals underwent
the decomposition, which may be expressed by the equation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
4NaCl + 2MgSO<sub>4</sub> = 2NaCl + MgSO<sub>4</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + MgCl<sub>2</sub> = 2Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> +
2MgCl<sub>2</sub>. A no less clear limit expressed itself in another of Malaguti's
researches when he investigated the above-mentioned reversible reactions
of the insoluble salts of barium. When, for example, barium carbonate
and sodium sulphate (BaCO<sub>3</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) were taken, then about 72 per
cent. of the salts were decomposed, that is, were converted into barium
sulphate and sodium carbonate. But when the two latter salts were
taken, then about 19 per cent. of them passed into barium carbonate
and sodium sulphate. Probably the end of the reaction was not
reached in either case, because this would require a considerable time
and a uniformity of conditions attainable with difficulty.</p>

<p>Gladstone (1855) took advantage of the colour of solutions of
different ferric salts for determining the measure of exchange between
metals. Thus a solution of ferric thiocyanate has a most intense
red colour, and by making a comparison between the colour of the
resulting solutions and the colour of solutions of known strength
it was possible to judge to a certain degree the quantity of the
thiocyanate formed. This colorimetric method of determination has
an important significance as being the first in which a method was applied
for determining the composition of a solution without the removal
of any of its component parts. When Gladstone took equivalent quantities
of ferric nitrate and potassium thiocyanate&mdash;Fe(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 3KCNS&mdash;only
13 per cent. of the salts underwent decomposition. On
increasing the mass of the latter salt the quantity of ferric thiocyanate
formed increased, but even when more than 300 equivalents of
potassium thiocyanate were taken a portion of the iron still remained
as nitrate. It is evident that the affinity acting between Fe and NO<sub>3</sub>
and between K and CNS on the one hand, is greater than the affinity
acting between Fe and CNS, together with the affinity of K for NO<sub>3</sub>,
on the other hand. The investigation of the variation of the fluorescence
of quinine sulphate, as well as the variation of the rotation of
the plane of polarisation of nicotine, gave in the hands of Gladstone
many proofs of the entire applicability of Berthollet's doctrine, and in
particular demonstrated the influence of mass which forms the chief
distinctive feature of the teaching of Berthollet, teaching little appreciated
in his own time.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the year 1860, the doctrine of the limit of
reaction and of the influence of mass on the process of chemical transformations
received a very important support in the researches of
Berthelot and P. de Saint-Gilles on the formation of the ethereal salts
RX from the alcohols ROH and acids HX, when water is also formed.
This conversion is essentially very similar to the formation of salts, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
differs in that it proceeds slowly at the ordinary temperature, extending
over whole years, and is not complete&mdash;that is, it has a distinct
limit determined by a reverse reaction; thus an ethereal salt RX with
water gives an alcohol ROH and an acid HX&mdash;up to that limit
generally corresponding with two-thirds of the alcohol taken, if the
action proceed between molecular quantities of alcohol and acid. Thus
common alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, with acetic acid, HC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, gives the following
system rapidly when heated, or slowly at the ordinary temperature,
ROH + HX + 2RX + 2H<sub>2</sub>O, whether we start from 3RHO + 3HX
or from 3RX + 3H<sub>2</sub>O. The process and completion of the reaction in
this instance are very easily observed, because the quantity of free
acid is easily determined from the amount of alkali requisite for its
saturation, as neither alcohol nor ethereal salt acts on litmus or
other reagent for acids. Under the influence of an increased mass
of alcohol the reaction proceeds further. If two molecules of alcohol,
RHO, be taken for every one molecule of acetic acid, HX, then instead
of 66 p.c., 83 p.c. of the acid passes into ethereal salt, and with fifty
molecules of RHO nearly all the acid is etherised. The researches of
Menschutkin in their details touched on many important aspects of the
same subject, such as the influence of the composition of the alcohol
and acid on the limit and rate of exchange&mdash;but these, as well as other
details, must be looked for in special treatises on organic and theoretical
chemistry. In any case the study of etherification has supplied chemical
mechanics with clear and valuable data, which directly confirm the
two fundamental propositions of Berthollet; the influence of mass,
and the limit of reaction&mdash;that is, the equilibrium between opposite
reactions. The study of numerous instances of dissociation which we
have already touched on, and shall again meet with on several
occasions, gave the same results. With respect to double saline
decompositions, it is also necessary to mention the researches of
Wiedemann on the decomposing action of a mass of water on the
ferric salts, which could be determined by measuring the magnetism
of the solutions, because the ferric oxide (soluble colloid) set free by
the water is less magnetic than the ferric salts.</p>

<p>A very important epoch in the history of Berthollet's doctrine was
attained when, in 1867, the Norwegian chemists, Guldberg and Waage,
expressed it as an algebraical formula. They defined the active mass
as the number of molecules contained in a given volume, and assumed,
as follows from the spirit of Berthollet's teaching, that the action between
the substances was equal to the product of the masses of the
reacting substances. Hence if the salts MX and NY be taken in
equivalent quantities (<i>m</i> = 1 and <i>n</i> = 1) and the salts MY and NX are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
not added to the mixture but proceed from it, then if <i>k</i> represent the
coefficient of the rate of the action of MX on NY and if <i>k</i>&#8242; represent
the same coefficient for the pair MY and NX, then we shall have at
the moment when the decomposition equals x a measure of action for
the first pair: <i>k</i>(1 - <i>x</i>)(1 - <i>x</i>) and for the second pair <i>k&#8242;xx</i>, and a
state of equilibrium or limit will be reached when <i>k</i>(1 - <i>x</i>)<sup>2</sup> = <i>k</i>&#8242;<i>x</i><sup>2</sup>,
whence the ratio <i>k</i>/<i>k</i>&#8242; = [<i>x</i>/(1 - <i>x</i>)]<sup>2</sup>. Therefore in the case of the
action of alcohol on an acid, when <i>x</i> = &#8532;, the magnitude <i>k</i>/<i>k</i>&#8242; = 4,
that is, the reaction of the alcohol on the acid is four times as fast as
that of the ethereal salt on water. If the ratio <i>k</i>/<i>k</i>&#8242; be known, then
the influence of mass may be easily determined from it. Thus if instead
of one molecule of alcohol two be taken, then the equation will be
<i>k</i>(2 - <i>x</i>)(1 - <i>x</i>) = <i>k&#8242;xx</i>, whence <i>x</i> = 0·85 or 85 percent., which is close
to the result of experiment. If 300 molecules of alcohol be taken, then
x proves to be approximately 100 per cent., which is also found to be the
case by experiment.<a name="FNanchor_26_598" id="FNanchor_26_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_598" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>But it is impossible to subject the formation of salts to any process
directly analogous to that which is so conveniently effected in etherification.
Many efforts have, however, been made to solve the problem
of the measure of reaction in this case also. Thus, for example,
Khichinsky (1866), Petrieff (1885), and many others investigated the
distribution of metals and haloid groups in the case of one metal and
several haloids taken in excess, as acids; or conversely with an excess
of bases, the distribution of these bases with relation to an acid; in
cases where a portion of the substances forms a precipitate and a
portion remains in solution. But such complex cases, although they in
general confirm Berthollet's teaching (for instance, a solution of silver
nitrate gives some silver oxide with lead oxide, and a solution of
nitrate of lead precipitates some lead oxide under the action of
silver oxide, as Petrieff demonstrated), still, owing to the complexity
of the phenomena (for instance, the formation of basic and double salts),
they cannot give simple results. But much more instructive and
complete are researches like those made by Pattison Muir (1876),
who took the simple case of the precipitation of calcium carbonate,
CaCO<sub>3</sub>, from the mixture of solutions of calcium chloride and sodium or
potassium carbonate, and found in this case that not only was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
rate of action (for example, in the case of CaCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, 75 per
cent. of CaCO<sub>3</sub> was precipitated in five minutes, 85 per cent. in thirty
minutes, and 94 per cent. in two days) determined by the temperature,
relative mass, and amount of water (a large mass of water decreases the
rate), but that the limit of decomposition was also dependent on these
influences. However, even in researches of this kind the conditions
of reaction are complicated by the non-uniformity of the media, inasmuch
as a portion of the substance is obtained or remains in the form of
a precipitate, so that the system is heterogeneous. The investigation of
double saline decompositions offers many difficulties which cannot be
considered as yet entirely overcome. Although many efforts have long
since been made, the majority of the researches were carried on in
aqueous solutions, and as water is itself a saline compound and
able to combine with salts and enter into double decomposition with
them, such reactions taking place in solutions in reality present very
complex cases.<a name="FNanchor_27_599" id="FNanchor_27_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_599" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In this sense the reaction between alcohols and acids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
is much more simple, and therefore its significance in confirmation
of Berthollet's doctrine is of particular importance. The only cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
which can be compared with these reactions for simplicity are those
exchange decompositions investigated by G. G. Gustavson, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
take place between CCl<sub>4</sub> and RBr<sub>n</sub> on the one hand, and CBr<sub>4</sub> and
RCl<sub>n</sub> on the other. This case is convenient for investigation inasmuch
as the RCl<sub>n</sub> and RBr<sub>n</sub> taken (such as BCl<sub>3</sub>, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, TiCl<sub>4</sub>, POCl<sub>3</sub>,
and SnCl<sub>4</sub>) belong to those substances which are decomposed
by water, whilst CCl<sub>4</sub> and CBr<sub>4</sub> are not decomposed by water; and
therefore, by heating, for instance, a mixture of CCl<sub>4</sub> + SiBr<sub>4</sub> it is
possible to arrive at a conclusion as to the amount of interchange
by treating the product with water, which decomposes the SiBr<sub>4</sub> left
unchanged and the SiCl<sub>4</sub> formed by the exchange, and therefore
by determining the composition of the product acted on by the water
it is possible to form a conclusion as to the amount of decomposition.
The mixture was always formed with equivalent quantities&mdash;for instance,
4BCl<sub>3</sub> + 3CBr<sub>4</sub>. It appeared that there was no exchange
whatever on simple intermixture, but that it proceeded slowly,
when the mixture was heated (for example, with the mixture above
mentioned at 123° 4·86 per cent. of Cl was replaced by Br after 14 days'
heating, and 6·83 per cent. after 28 days, and 10·12 per cent. when
heated at 150° for 60 days). A limit was always reached which
corresponded with that of the complemental system; in the given
instance the system 4BBr<sub>3</sub> + 3CCl<sub>4</sub>. In this last 89·97 per cent. of
bromine in the BBr<sub>3</sub> was replaced by chlorine; that is, there were
obtained 89·97 molecules of BCl<sub>3</sub> and there remained 10·02 molecules
of BBr<sub>3</sub>, and therefore the same state of equilibrium was reached as
that given by the system 4BCl<sub>3</sub> + 3CBr<sub>4</sub>. Both systems gave one and
the same state of equilibrium at the limit, which is in agreement with
Berthollet's doctrine.<a name="FNanchor_28_600" id="FNanchor_28_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_600" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus we now find ample confirmation from various quarters for the
following rules of Berthollet, applying them to double saline decompositions:
1. From two salts MX and NY containing different haloids
and metals there result from their reaction two others, MY and NX,
but such a substitution will not proceed to the end unless one product
passes from the sphere of action. 2. This reaction is limited by the
existence of an equilibrium between MX, NY, MY, and NX, because a
reverse reaction is quite as possible as the direct reaction. 3. This limit
is determined both by the measure of the active affinities and by the relative

<p>Thus if the salts MX and NY after reaction partly formed salts MY
and NX, then a state of equilibrium is reached and the reaction ceases;
but if one of the resultant compounds, in virtue of its physical properties,
passes from the sphere of action of the remaining substances, then the
reaction will continue. This exit from the sphere of action depends on
the physical properties of the substance and on the conditions under
which the reaction takes place. Thus, for instance, the salt NX may,
in the case of reaction between solutions, separate as a precipitate,
an insoluble substance, while the other three substances remain in solution,
or it may pass into vapour, and in this manner also pass away
from the sphere of action of the remaining substances. Let us now
suppose that it passes away in some form or other from the sphere of
action of the remaining substances&mdash;for instance, that it is transformed
into a precipitate or vapour&mdash;then a fresh reaction will set in and a
re-formation of the salt NX. If this be removed, then, although the
quantity of the elements N and X in the mass will be diminished, still,
according to Berthollet's law, a certain amount of NX should be again
formed. When this substance is again formed, then, owing to its
physical properties, it will again pass away; hence the reaction,
in consequence of the physical properties of the resultant substances, is
able to proceed to completion notwithstanding the possible weakness of
the attraction existing between the elements entering into the composition
of the resultant substance NX. Naturally, if the resultant
substance is formed of elements having a considerable degree of
affinity, then the complete decomposition is considerably facilitated.</p>

<p>Such a representation of the <i>modus operandi</i> of chemical transformations
is applicable with great clearness to a number of reactions
studied in chemistry, and, what is especially important, the
application of this aspect of Berthollet's teaching does not in any way
require the determination of the measure of affinity acting between the
substances present. For instance, the action of ammonia on solutions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
of salts; the displacement, by its means, of basic hydrates insoluble in
water; the separation of volatile nitric acid by the aid of non-volatile
sulphuric acid, as well as the decomposition of common salt by means
of sulphuric acid, when gaseous hydrochloric acid is formed&mdash;may be
taken as examples of reactions which proceed to the end, inasmuch as
one of the resultant substances is entirely removed from the sphere of
action, but they in no way indicate the measure of affinity.<a name="FNanchor_30_602" id="FNanchor_30_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_602" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>As a proof that double decompositions like the above are actually
accomplished in the sense of Berthollet's doctrine, the fact may be cited
that common salt may be entirely decomposed by nitric acid, and nitre
may be completely decomposed by hydrochloric acid, just as they are
decomposed by sulphuric acid; but this only takes place when, in the
first instance, an excess of nitric acid is taken, and in the second instance,
an excess of hydrochloric acid, for a given quantity of the sodium salt,
and when the resultant acid passes off. If sodium chloride be put into
a porcelain evaporating basin, nitric acid added to it, and the mixture
heated, then both hydrochloric and nitric acids are expelled by
the heat. Thus the nitric acid partially acts on the sodium chloride,
but on heating, as both acids are volatile, they are both converted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
vapour; and therefore the residue will contain a mixture of a certain
quantity of the sodium chloride taken and of the sodium nitrate formed.
If a fresh quantity of nitric acid be then added, reaction will again set
in, a certain portion of hydrochloric acid is again evolved, and on heating
is expelled together with nitric acid. If this be repeated several
times, it is possible to expel all the hydrochloric acid, and to obtain
sodium nitrate only in the residue. If, on the contrary, we take
sodium nitrate and add hydrochloric acid to it in an aqueous solution,
a certain quantity of the hydrochloric acid displaces a portion of the
nitric acid, and on heating the excess of hydrochloric acid passes away
with the nitric acid formed. On repeating this process, it is possible
to displace the nitric acid with an excess of hydrochloric acid, just as
it was possible to displace the hydrochloric acid by an excess of nitric
acid. The influence of the mass of the substance in action and the
influence of volatility are here very distinctly seen. Hence it may be
affirmed that sulphuric acid does not displace hydrochloric acid
because of an especially high degree of affinity, but that this reaction is
only carried on to the end because the sulphuric acid is not volatile,
whilst the hydrochloric acid which is formed is volatile.</p>

<p>The preparation of hydrochloric acid in the laboratory and on a
large scale is based upon these data. In the first instance, an excess
of sulphuric acid is employed in order that the reaction may proceed
easily at a low temperature, whilst on a large scale, when it is
necessary to economise every material, equivalent quantities are taken
in order to obtain the normal salt Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and not the acid salt, which
would require twice as much acid. The hydrochloric acid evolved is
a gas which is very soluble in water. It is most frequently used
in practice in this state of solution under the name of <i>muriatic acid</i>.<a name="FNanchor_31_603" id="FNanchor_31_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_603" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

are first mixed and heated. C, muffle for the ultimate decomposition.</p></div>

<p>In chemical works the decomposition of sodium chloride by means of
sulphuric acid is carried on on a very large scale, chiefly with a view to
the preparation of normal sodium sulphate, the hydrochloric acid being
a bye-product.<a name="FNanchor_31_BIS_604" id="FNanchor_31_BIS_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_BIS_604" class="fnanchor">[31 bis]</a> The furnace employed is termed a <i>salt cake furnace</i>.
It is represented in fig. <a href="#fig_65">65</a>, and consists of the following two parts: the
pan B and the roaster C, or enclosed space built up of large bricks
<i>a</i> and enveloped on all sides by the smoke and flames from the fire
grate, F. The ultimate decomposition of the salt by the sulphuric
acid is accomplished in the roaster. But the first decomposition
of sodium chloride by sulphuric acid does not require so high a
temperature as the ultimate decomposition, and is therefore carried
on in the front and cooler portion, B, whose bottom is heated by gas
flues. When the reaction in this portion ceases and the evolution
of hydrochloric acid stops, then the mass, which contains about
half of the sodium chloride still undecomposed, and the sulphuric
acid in the form of acid sodium sulphate, is removed from B and
thrown into the roaster C, where the action is completed. Normal
sodium sulphate, which we shall afterwards describe, remains in the
roaster. It is employed both directly in the manufacture of glass, and
in the preparation of other sodium compounds&mdash;for instance, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
preparation of soda ash, as will afterwards be described. For the present
we will only turn our attention to the hydrochloric acid evolved in B
and C.</p>

<p>The hydrochloric acid gas evolved is subjected to condensation by
dissolving it in water.<a name="FNanchor_32_605" id="FNanchor_32_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_605" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> If the apparatus in which the decomposition
is accomplished were hermetically closed, and only presented one outlet,
then the escape of the hydrochloric acid would only proceed through
the escape pipe intended for this purpose. But as it is impossible to
construct a perfectly hermetically closed furnace of this kind, it is
necessary to increase the draught by artificial means, or to oblige the
hydrochloric acid gas to pass through those arrangements in which it is
to be condensed. This is done by connecting the ends of the tubes
through which the hydrochloric acid gas escapes from the furnace with high
chimneys, where a strong draught is set up from the combustion of the
fuel. This causes a current of hydrochloric acid gas to pass through the
absorbing apparatus in a definite direction. Here it encounters a current
of water flowing in the opposite direction, by which it is absorbed.
It is not customary to cause the acid to pass through the water, but
only to bring it into contact with the surface of the water. The absorption
apparatus consists of large earthenware vessels having four orifices,
two above and two lateral ones in the wide central portion of each
vessel. The upper orifices serve for connecting the vessels together,
and the hydrochloric acid gas escaping from the furnace passes through
these tubes. The water for absorbing the acid enters at the upper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
flows out from the lower, vessel, passing through the lateral orifices
in the vessels. The water flows from the chimney towards the furnace
and it is therefore evident that the outflowing water will be the most
saturated with acid, of which it actually contains about 20 per cent.
The absorption in these vessels is not complete. The ultimate absorption
of the hydrochloric acid is carried on in the so-called <i>coke towers</i>,
which usually consist of two adjacent chimneys. A lattice-work of
bricks is laid on the bottom of these towers, on which coke is
piled up to the top of the tower. Water, distributing itself over the
coke, trickles down to the bottom of the tower, and in so doing absorbs
the hydrochloric acid gas rising upwards.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood that hydrochloric acid may be
obtained from all other metallic chlorides.<a name="FNanchor_33_606" id="FNanchor_33_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_606" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> It is frequently formed
in other reactions, many of which we shall meet with in the further
course of this work. It is, for instance, formed by the action of
water on sulphur chloride, phosphorus chloride, antimony chloride, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Hydrochloric acid</i> is a colourless gas having a pungent suffocating
odour and an acid taste. This gas fumes in air and attracts moisture,
because it forms vapour containing a compound of hydrochloric acid and
water. Hydrochloric acid is liquefied by cold, and under a pressure of
40 atmospheres, into a colourless liquid of sp. gr. 0·908 at 0°,<a name="FNanchor_34_607" id="FNanchor_34_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_607" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> boiling
point -35° and absolute boiling point +52°. We have already seen
(Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.) that hydrochloric acid combines very energetically <i>with
water</i>, and in so doing evolves a considerable amount of heat. The
solution saturated in the cold attains a density 1·23. On heating such
a solution containing about 45 parts of acid per 100 parts, the hydrochloric<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
acid gas is expelled with only a slight admixture of aqueous
vapour. But it is impossible to entirely separate the whole of the
hydrochloric acid from the water by this means, as could be done in
the case of an ammoniacal solution. The temperature required for the
evolution of the gas rises and reaches 110°&ndash;111°, and after this remains
constant&mdash;that is, a solution having a constant boiling point is obtained
(as with HNO<sub>3</sub>), which, however, does not (Roscoe and Dittmar)
present a constant composition under different pressures, because the
hydrate is decomposed in distillation, as is seen from the determinations
of its vapour density (Bineau). Judging from the facts (1) that with
decrease of the pressure under which the distillation proceeds the
solution of constant boiling point approaches to a composition of 25 p.c.
of hydrochloric acid,<a name="FNanchor_35_608" id="FNanchor_35_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_608" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> (2) that by passing a stream of dry air through
a solution of hydrochloric acid there is obtained in the residue a solution
which also approaches to 25 p.c. of acid, and more nearly as the temperature
falls,<a name="FNanchor_36_609" id="FNanchor_36_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_609" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> (3) that many of the properties of solutions of hydrochloric
acid vary distinctly according as they contain more or less than 25 p.c.
of hydrochloric acid (for instance, antimonious sulphide gives hydrogen
sulphide with a stronger acid, but is not acted on by a weaker
solution, also a stronger solution fumes in the air, &amp;c.), and (4) that the
composition HCl,6H<sub>2</sub>O corresponds with 25·26 p.c. HCl&mdash;judging from
all these data, and also from the loss of tension which occurs in the
combination of hydrochloric acid with water, it may be said that they
form a <i>definite hydrate</i> of the composition HCl,6H<sub>2</sub>O. Besides this
hydrate there exists also a crystallo-hydrate, HCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O,<a name="FNanchor_37_610" id="FNanchor_37_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_610" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which is
formed by the absorption of hydrochloric acid by a saturated solution
at a temperature of -23°. It crystallises and melts at -18°.<a name="FNanchor_38_611" id="FNanchor_38_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_611" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Whilst for solutions which contain a greater proportion of hydrogen
chloride than HCl,6H<sub>2</sub>O, these coefficients <i>decrease</i> with a rise of
temperature; for instance, for 30 p.c. of hydrogen chloride <i>S</i><sub>0</sub> - <i>S</i><sub>15</sub>
= 88 and <i>S</i><sub>15</sub> - <i>S</i><sub>30</sub> = 87 (according to Marignac's data). In the case
of HCl,6H<sub>2</sub>O these differences are constant, and equal 76.</p>

<p>Thus the formation of two definite hydrates, HCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O and
HCl,6H<sub>2</sub>O, between hydrochloric acid and water may be accepted
upon the basis of many facts. But both of them, if they occur in a
liquid state, dissociate with great facility into hydrogen chloride and
water, and are completely decomposed when distilled.</p>

<p>All solutions of hydrochloric acid present the properties of an
energetic acid. They not only transform blue vegetable colouring
matter into red, and disengage carbonic acid gas from carbonates, &amp;c.,
but they also entirely saturate bases, even such energetic ones as potash,
lime, &amp;c. In a dry state, however, hydrochloric acid does not alter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
vegetable dyes, and does not effect many double decompositions which
easily take place in the presence of water. This is explained by the
fact that the gaso-elastic state of the hydrochloric acid prevents its
entering into reaction. However, incandescent iron, zinc, sodium, &amp;c.,
act on gaseous hydrochloric acid, displacing the hydrogen and leaving
half a volume of hydrogen for each volume of hydrochloric acid gas;
this reaction may serve for determining the composition of hydrochloric
acid. Combined with water hydrochloric acid acts as an acid
much resembling nitric acid<a name="FNanchor_42_615" id="FNanchor_42_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_615" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> in its energy and in many of its reactions;
however, the latter contains oxygen, which is disengaged with great ease,
and so very frequently acts as an oxidiser, which hydrochloric acid is not
capable of doing. The majority of metals (even those which do not
displace the H from H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, but which, like copper, decompose it to the
limit of SO<sub>2</sub>) displace the hydrogen from hydrochloric acid. Thus
hydrogen is disengaged by the action of zinc, and even of copper and
tin.<a name="FNanchor_42_BIS_616" id="FNanchor_42_BIS_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_BIS_616" class="fnanchor">[42 bis]</a> Only a few metals withstand its action; for example, gold
and platinum. Lead in compact masses is only acted on feebly,
because the lead chloride formed is insoluble and prevents the further
action of the acid on the metal. The same is to be remarked with respect
to the feeble action of hydrochloric acid on mercury and silver,
because the compounds of these metals, AgCl and HgCl, are insoluble
in water. Metallic chlorides are not only formed by the action of
hydrochloric acid on the metals, but also by many other methods; for
instance, by the action of hydrochloric acid on the carbonates, oxides,
and hydroxides, and also by the action of chlorine on metals and certain
of their compounds. Metallic chlorides have a composition MCl; for
example, NaCl, KCl, AgCl, HgCl, if the metal replaces hydrogen
equivalent for equivalent, or, as it is said, if it be monatomic or
univalent. In the case of bivalent metals, they have a composition
MCl<sub>2</sub>; for example, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, CuCl<sub>2</sub>, PbCl<sub>2</sub>, HgCl<sub>2</sub>, FeCl<sub>2</sub>, MnCl<sub>2</sub>. The
composition of the haloid salts of other metals presents a further
variation; for example, AlCl<sub>3</sub>, PtCl<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c. Many metals, for instance
Fe, give several degrees of combination with chlorine (FeCl<sub>2</sub>, FeCl<sub>3</sub>)
as with hydrogen. In their composition the metallic chlorides differ
from the corresponding oxides, in that the O is replaced by Cl<sub>2</sub>, as should
follow from the law of substitution, because oxygen gives OH<sub>2</sub>, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
consequently bivalent, whilst chlorine forms HCl, and is therefore
univalent. So, for instance, ferrous oxide, FeO, corresponds with
ferrous chloride, FeCl<sub>2</sub>, and the oxide Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> with ferric chloride, which
is also seen from the origin of these compounds, for FeCl<sub>2</sub> is obtained
by the action of hydrochloric acid on ferrous oxide or carbonate
and FeCl<sub>3</sub> by its action on ferric oxide. In a word, all the typical
properties of acids are shown by hydrochloric acid, and all the typical
properties of salts in the metallic chlorides derived from it. Acids and
salts composed like HCl and M<sub>n</sub>Cl<sub>2m</sub> without any oxygen bear the name
of haloid salts; for instance, HCl is a haloid acid, NaCl a haloid salt,
chlorine a halogen. The capacity of hydrochloric acid to give, by its
action on bases, MO, a metallic chloride, MCl<sub>2</sub>, and water, is limited at
high temperatures by the reverse reaction MCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = MO + 2HCl,
and the more pronounced are the basic properties of MO the feebler is
the reverse action, while for feebler bases such as Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MgO, &amp;c., this
reverse reaction proceeds with ease. Metallic chlorides corresponding
with the peroxides either do not exist, or are easily decomposed with
the disengagement of chlorine. Thus there is no compound BaCl<sub>4</sub>
corresponding with the peroxide BaO<sub>2</sub>. Metallic chlorides having
the general aspect of salts, like their representative sodium chloride,
are, as a rule, easily fusible, more so than the oxides (for instance, CaO
is infusible at a furnace heat, whilst CaCl<sub>2</sub> is easily fused) and many
other salts. Under the action of heat many chlorides are more stable
than the oxides, some can even be converted into vapour; thus corrosive
sublimate, HgCl<sub>2</sub>, is particularly volatile, whilst the oxide HgO
decomposes at a red heat. Silver chloride, AgCl, is fusible and
is decomposed with difficulty, whilst Ag<sub>2</sub>O is easily decomposed. The
majority of the metallic chlorides are soluble in water, but silver
chloride, cuprous chloride, mercurous chloride, and lead chloride are
sparingly soluble in water, and are therefore easily obtained as precipitates
when a solution of the salts of these metals is mixed with a
solution of any chloride or even with hydrochloric acid. The metal
contained in a haloid salt may often be replaced by another metal, or
even by hydrogen, just as is the case with a metal in an oxide. Thus
copper displaces mercury from a solution of mercuric chloride,
HgCl<sub>2</sub> + Cu = CuCl<sub>2</sub> + Hg, and hydrogen at a red heat displaces silver
from silver chloride, 2AgCl + H<sub>2</sub> = Ag<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl. These, and a whole
series of similar reactions, form the typical methods of double saline
decompositions. The measure of decomposition and the conditions under
which reactions of double saline decompositions proceed in one or in the
other direction are determined by the properties of the compounds
which take part in the reaction, and of those capable of formation at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span>
temperature, &amp;c., as was shown in the preceding portions of this chapter,
and as will be frequently found hereafter.</p>

<p>If hydrochloric acid enters into double decomposition with basic
oxides and their hydrates, this is only due to its acid properties; and
for the same reason it rarely enters into double decomposition with
acids and acid anhydrides. Sometimes, however, it combines with the
latter, as, for instance, with the anhydride of sulphuric acid, forming
the compound SO<sub>3</sub>HCl; and in other cases it acts on acids, giving up
its hydrogen to their oxygen and forming chlorine, as will be seen in
the <a href="#Page_459">following chapter</a>.</p>

<p>Hydrochloric acid, as may already be concluded from the composition
of its molecule, belongs to the monobasic acids, and does not,
therefore, give true acid salts (like HNaSO<sub>4</sub> or HNaCO<sub>3</sub>); nevertheless
many metallic chlorides, formed from powerful bases, are capable of
<i>combining with hydrochloric acid</i>, just as they combine with water, or
with ammonia, or as they give double salts. Compounds have long
been known of hydrochloric acid with auric, platinic, and antimonious
chlorides, and other similar metallic chlorides corresponding with very
feeble bases. But Berthelot, Engel, and others have shown that the
capacity of HCl for combining with M<sub><i>n</i></sub>Cl<sub><i>m</i></sub> is much more frequently
encountered than was previously supposed. Thus, for instance, dry hydrochloric
acid when passed into a solution of zinc chloride (containing an
excess of the salt) gives in the cold (0°) a compound HCl,ZnCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O,
and at the ordinary temperature HCl,2ZnCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, just as it is able at
low temperatures to form the crystallo-hydrate ZnCl<sub>2</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O (Engel,
1886). Similar compounds are obtained with CdCl<sub>2</sub>,CuCl<sub>2</sub>, HgCl<sub>2</sub>,Fe<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>,
&amp;c. (Berthelot, Ditte, Cheltzoff, Lachinoff, and others). These compounds
with hydrochloric acid are generally more soluble in water than
the metallic chlorides themselves, so that whilst hydrochloric acid
decreases the solubility of M<sub><i>n</i></sub>Cl<sub><i>m</i></sub>, corresponding with energetic bases (for
instance, sodium or barium chlorides), it increases the solubility of the
metallic chlorides corresponding with feeble bases (cadmium chloride,
ferric chloride, &amp;c.) Silver chloride, which is insoluble in water, is soluble
in hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid also combines with certain unsaturated
hydrocarbons (for instance, with turpentine, C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub>,2HCl) and
their derivatives. <i>Sal-ammoniac</i>, or ammonia hydrochloride, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl
= NH<sub>3</sub>,HCl, also belongs to this class of compounds.<a name="FNanchor_43_617" id="FNanchor_43_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_617" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> If hydrogen
chloride gas be mixed with ammonia gas a solid compound consisting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
of equal volumes of each is immediately formed. The same compound
is obtained on mixing solutions of the two gases. It is also
produced by the action of hydrochloric acid on ammonium carbonate.
Sal-ammoniac is usually prepared, in practice, by the last method.<a name="FNanchor_44_618" id="FNanchor_44_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_618" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
The specific gravity of sal-ammoniac is 1·55. We have already seen
(Chapter <a href="#Page_246">VI</a>.) that sal-ammoniac, like all other ammonium salts, easily
decomposes; for instance, by volatilisation with alkalis, and even
partially when its solution is boiled. The other properties and
reactions of sal-ammoniac, especially in solution, fully recall
those already mentioned in speaking of sodium chloride. Thus,
for instance, with silver nitrate it gives a precipitate of silver chloride;
with sulphuric acid it gives hydrochloric acid and ammonium sulphate,
and it forms double salts with certain metallic chlorides and other
salts.<a name="FNanchor_45_619" id="FNanchor_45_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_619" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

atomicity or valency, because the atomicity of the elements is variable, and furthermore
this variability is not identical for different elements. In CO<sub>2</sub>, COX<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and the
multitude of carbon compounds corresponding with them, the C is quadrivalent, but in
CO either the carbon must be taken as bivalent or the atomicity of oxygen be accounted
as variable. Moreover, carbon is an example of an element which preserves its atomicity
to a greater degree than most of the other elements. Nitrogen in NH<sub>3</sub>, NH<sub>2</sub>(OH),
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and even in CNH, must be considered as trivalent, but in NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, NO<sub>2</sub>(OH), and
in all their corresponding compounds it is necessarily pentavalent. In N<sub>2</sub>O, if the
atomicity of oxygen = 2, nitrogen has an uneven atomicity (1, 3, 5), whilst in NO it is
bivalent. If sulphur be bivalent, like oxygen, in many of its compounds (for example,
H<sub>2</sub>S, SCl<sub>2</sub>, KHS, &amp;c.), then it could not be foreseen from this that it would form SO<sub>2</sub>,
SO<sub>3</sub>, SCl<sub>4</sub>, SOCl<sub>2</sub>, and a series of similar compounds in which its atomicity must be
acknowledged as greater than 2. Thus SO<sub>2</sub>, sulphurous anhydride, has many
points in common with CO<sub>2</sub>, and if carbon be quadrivalent then the S in SO<sub>2</sub> is
quadrivalent. Therefore the principle of atomicity (valency) of the elements cannot be
considered established as the basis for the study of the elements, although it gives an easy
method of grasping many analogies. I consider the four following as the chief obstacles
to acknowledging the atomicity of the elements as a primary conception for the consideration
of the properties of the elements: 1. Such univalent elements as H, Cl, &amp;c.,
appear in a free state as molecules H<sub>2</sub>, Cl<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., and are consequently like the univalent
radicles CH<sub>3</sub>, OH, CO<sub>2</sub>H, &amp;c., which, as might be expected, appear as C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>,
C<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>H<sub>2</sub> (ethane, hydrogen peroxide, oxalic acid), whilst on the other hand, potassium
and sodium (perhaps also iodine at a high temperature) contain only one atom, K, Na,
in the molecule in a free state. Hence it follows that <i>free affinities</i> may exist. Granting
this, nothing prevents the assumption that free affinities exist in all unsaturated compounds;
for example, two free affinities in NH<sub>3</sub>. If such instances of free affinities be
admitted, then all the possible advantages to be gained by the application of the doctrine
of atomicity (valency) are lost. 2. There are instances&mdash;for example, Na<sub>2</sub>H&mdash;where univalent
elements are combined in molecules which are more complex than R<sub>2</sub>, and form
molecules, R<sub>3</sub>, R<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c.; this may again be either taken as evidence of the existence of
free affinities, or else necessitates such primary univalent elements as sodium and
hydrogen being considered as variable in their atomicity. 3. The periodic system of the
elements, with which we shall afterwards become acquainted, shows that there is a law
or rule for the variation of the forms of oxygen and hydrogen compounds; chlorine is
univalent with respect to hydrogen, and septavalent with respect to oxygen; sulphur is
bivalent to hydrogen, and sexavalent to oxygen; phosphorus is trivalent to hydrogen
and pentavalent in respect to oxygen&mdash;the sum is in every case equal to 8. Only carbon
and its analogues (for example, silicon) are quadrivalent to both hydrogen and oxygen.
Hence the power of the elements to change their atomicity is an essential part of their
nature, and therefore constant valency cannot he considered as a fundamental property.
4. Crystallo-hydrates (for instance, NaCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O, or NaBr,2H<sub>2</sub>O), double salts (such as
PtCl<sub>4</sub>,2KCl,H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>, &amp;c.), and similar complex compounds (and, according to Chap. <a href="#Page_40">I.</a>,
solutions also) demonstrate the capacity not only of the elements themselves, but also of
their saturated and limiting compounds, of entering into further combination. Therefore
the admission of a definite limited atomicity of the elements includes in itself an
admission of limitation which is not in accordance with the nature of chemical reactions.</p></div>

been deposited from water (have not a stratified formation and contain no remains of
animal or vegetable life), occur under the sedimentary formations of the earth, and are
everywhere uniform in composition and structure, the latter being generally distinctly
crystalline. If it be assumed that the earth was originally in a molten condition, the
first primary formations are those which formed the first solid crust of the earth. But
even with this hypothesis of the earth's origin, it is necessary to admit that the first
aqueous deposits must have caused a change in the original crust of the earth, and
therefore under the head of primary formations must be understood the most ancient of
the products of decomposition (mostly by atmospheric, aqueous, and organic agency, &amp;c.),
from which all the rocks and substances of the earth's surface have arisen. In speaking
of the origin of one or another substance, we can only, on the basis of facts, descend to
the primary formations, of which granite, gneiss, and trachyte may be taken as examples.</p></div>

fine dust; in the lower strata it is present in larger quantities than in the upper,
so that the rain water falling on mountains contains less NaCl than that falling in
valleys. Müntz (1891) found that a litre of rain water collected on the summit of
the Pic du Midi (2,877 metres above the sea level) contained 0·34 milligram of chloride
of sodium, while a litre of rain collected from the valley contained 2·5&ndash;7·6 milligrams.</p></div>

the Isle of Camarga about 1870, when I had occasion to visit that spot. At the present
time the deposits of Stassfurt provide a much cheaper salt, owing to the evaporation and
separation of the salt being carried on there by natural means and only requiring a treatment
and refining, which is also necessary in addition for the &lsquo;summer salt&rsquo; obtained
from sea-water.</p></div>

formed from solutions containing an excess of magnesium chloride, because water decomposes
this double salt, extracting the more soluble magnesium chloride from it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_573" id="Footnote_5_573"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_573"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Owing to the fundamental property of salts of interchanging their metals, it
cannot be said that sea water contains this or that salt, but only that it contains certain
amounts of certain metals M (univalent like Na and K, and bivalent like Mg and Ca), and
haloids X (univalent like Cl, Br, and bivalent like SO<sub>4</sub>, CO<sub>3</sub>), which are disposed in
every possible kind of grouping; for instance, K as KCl, KBr, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, Mg as MgCl<sub>2</sub>,
MgBr<sub>2</sub>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and so on for all the other metals. In evaporation different salts separate
out consecutively only because they reach saturation. A proof of this may be seen in
the fact that a solution of a mixture of sodium chloride and magnesium sulphate (both
of which salts are obtained from sea water, as was mentioned above), when evaporated,
deposits crystals of these salts, but when refrigerated (if the solution be sufficiently
saturated) the salt Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O is first deposited because it is the first to arrive at
saturation at low temperatures. Consequently this solution contains MgCl<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
besides MgSO<sub>4</sub> and NaCl. So it is with sea water.</p></div>

and their depth below the surface, on the basis of information collected from
various quarters respecting bore-holes and the direction of the strata, and when the
borings, conducted by the Government, struck a salt-bed which was bitter and unfit
for use, there was a great outcry against science, and the doubtful result even caused
the cessation of the further work of deepening the shafts. It required a great
effort to persuade the Government to continue the work. Now, when the pure salt
encountered below forms one of the important riches of Germany, and when those
&lsquo;refuse salts&rsquo; have proved to be most valuable (as a source of potassium and magnesium),
we should see in the utilisation of the Stassfurt deposits one of the conquests of science
for the common welfare.</p></div>

near Cracow, and at Cardona in Spain. In Russia the following deposits are known:
(<i>a</i>) the vast masses of rock salt (3 square kilometres area and up to 140 metres thick)
lying directly on the surface of the earth at Iletzky Zastchit, on the left bank of the river
Ural, in the Government of Orenburg; (<i>b</i>) the Chingaksky deposit, 90 versts from the
river Volga, in the Enotaeffsky district of the Government of Astrakhan; (<i>c</i>) the
Kulepinsky (and other) deposits (whose thickness attains 150 metres), on the Araks, in
the Government of Erivan in the Caucasus; (<i>d</i>) the Katchiezmansky deposit in the
province of Kars; (<i>e</i>) the Krasnovodsky deposit in the Trans-Caspian province; and (<i>f</i>)

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_577" id="Footnote_8_577"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_577"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> The fracture of rock salt generally shows the presence of interlayers of impurities
which are sometimes very small in weight, but visible owing to their refraction. In the
excellently laid out salt mines of Briansk I counted (1888), if my memory does not
deceive me, on an average ten interlayers per metre of thickness, between which the salt
was in general very pure, and in places quite transparent. If this be the case, then there
would be 350 interlayers for the whole thickness (about 35 metres) of the bed. They
probably correspond with the yearly deposition of the salt. In this case the deposition
would have extended over more than 300 years. This should be observable at the present
day in lakes where the salt is saturated and in course of deposition.</p></div>

In this respect salt is twice as secure as bricks, and therefore immense masses may be
extracted from underground workings with perfect safety, without having recourse to
brickwork supports, merely taking advantage of the properties of the salt itself.</p></div>

several small crystals of sodium chloride are placed at the bottom, and the solution
is allowed to evaporate slowly in a vessel with a loose-fitting cover. Octahedral crystals
are obtained by the addition of borax, urea, &amp;c., to the solution. Very fine crystals are
formed in a mass of gelatinous silica.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_581" id="Footnote_12_581"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_581"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> If a solution of sodium chloride be slowly heated from above, where the evaporation
takes place, then the upper layer will become saturated before the lower and cooler
layers, and therefore crystallisation will begin on the surface, and the crystals first formed
will float, having also dried from above, on the surface until they become quite soaked.
Being heavier than the solution the crystals are partially immersed under it, and the
following crystallisation, also proceeding on the surface, will only form crystals along
the side of the original crystals. A funnel is formed in this manner. It will be
borne on the surface like a boat (if the liquid be quiescent), because it will grow more
from the upper edges. We can thus understand this at first sight strange funnel form
of crystallisation of salt. In explanation why the crystallisation under the above
conditions begins at the surface and not at the lower layers, it must be mentioned that
the specific gravity of a crystal of sodium chloride = 2·16, and that of a solution saturated
at 25° contains 26·7 p.c. of salt and has a specific gravity at 25°/4° of 1·2004; at 15° a
saturated solution contains 26·5 p.c. of salt and has a sp. gr. 1·203 at 15°/4°. Hence a
solution saturated at a higher temperature is specifically lighter, notwithstanding the
greater amount of salt it contains. With many substances <i>surface crystallisation</i> cannot
take place because their solubility increases more rapidly with the temperature than their
specific gravity decreases. In this case the saturated solution will always be in the lower
layers, where also the crystallisation will take place. Besides which it may be added that
as a consequence of the properties of water and solutions, when they are heated from above
(for instance, by the sun's rays), the warmer layers being the lightest remain above, whilst
when heated from below they rise to the top. For this reason the water at great depths
below the surface is always cold, which has long been known. These circumstances, as well
as those observed by Soret (Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>), explain the great differences of density
and temperature, and in the amount of salts held in the oceans at different latitudes (in
polar and tropical climes) and at various depths.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_582" id="Footnote_13_582"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_582"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> By combining the results of Poggiale, Müller, and Karsten (they are evidently
more accurate than those of Gay-Lussac and others) I found that a saturated solution at
<i>t</i>°, from 0° to 108°, contains 35·7 + 0·024<i>t</i> + 0·0002<i>t</i><sup>2</sup> grams of salt per 100 grams of water.
This formula gives a solubility at 0° = 35·7 grams (= 26·3 p.c.), whilst according to Karsten
it is 36·09, Poggiale 35·5, and Müller 35·6 grams.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_583" id="Footnote_14_583"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_583"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Perfectly pure <i>fused</i> salt is not hygroscopic, according to Karsten, whilst the
crystallised salt, even when quite pure, attracts as much as 0·6 p.c. of water from moist
air, according to Stas. (In the Briansk mines, where the temperature throughout the
whole year is about +10°, it may be observed, as Baron Klodt informed me, that in the
summer during damp weather the walls become moist, while in winter they are dry).</p>

<p>If the salt contain impurities&mdash;such as magnesium sulphate, &amp;c.&mdash;it is more hygroscopic.
If it contain any magnesium chloride, it partially deliquesces in a damp atmosphere.
The crystallised and not perfectly pure salt decrepitates when heated, owing to
its containing water. The pure salt, and also the transparent rock salt, or that which
has been once fused, does not decrepitate. Fused sodium chloride shows a faint alkaline
reaction to litmus, which has been noticed by many observers, and is due to the presence
of sodium oxide (probably by the action of the oxygen of the atmosphere). According
to A. Stcherbakoff very sensitive litmus (washed in alcohol and neutralised with oxalic
acid) shows an alkaline reaction even with the crystallised salt.</p>

<p>It may be observed that rock salt sometimes contains cavities filled with a colourless
liquid. Certain kinds of rock salt emit an odour like that of hydrocarbons. These
phenomena have as yet received very little attention.</p></div>

I obtained first of all well-formed tabular (six-sided) crystals, which when warmed to
the ordinary temperature disintegrated (with the separation of anhydrous sodium
chloride), and then prismatic needles up to 20 mm. long were formed from the same
solution. I have not yet investigated the reason of the difference in crystalline form.
It is known (Mitscherlich) that NaI,2H<sub>2</sub>O also crystallises either in plates or prisms.
Sodium bromide also crystallises with 2H<sub>2</sub>O at the ordinary temperature.</p></div>

formation of ice from solution, still even for sodium chloride they cannot yet be considered
as sufficiently harmonious. According to Blagden and Raoult, the temperature
of the formation of ice from a solution containing <i>c</i> grams of salt per 100 grams of water
= -0·6<i>c</i> to <i>c</i> = 10, according to Rosetti = -0·649<i>c</i> to <i>c</i> = 8·7, according to De Coppet
(to <i>c</i> = 10) = -0·55<i>c</i> - 0·006<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>, according to Karsten (to <i>c</i> = 10) - 0·762<i>c</i> + 0·0084<i>c</i><sup>2</sup>, and
according to Guthrie a much lower figure. By taking Rosetti's figure and applying

<p>The data for strong solutions are not less contradictory. Thus with 20 p.c. of salt, ice
is formed at -14·4° according to Karsten, -17° according to Guthrie, -17·6° according
to De Coppet. Rüdorff states that for strong solutions the temperature of the formation
of ice descends in proportion to the contents of the compound, NaCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O (per 100 grams
of water) by 0°·342 per 1 gram of salt, and De Coppet shows that there is no proportionality,
in a strict sense, for either a percentage of NaCl or of NaCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<p>Solutions of common salt have also been frequently investigated as regards rate of

mentioned that Graham and De Vries demonstrated that diffusion in gelatinous masses
(for instance, gelatin jelly, or gelatinous silica) proceeds in the same manner as in water,
which may probably lead to a convenient and accurate method for the investigation
of the phenomena of diffusion. N. Umoff (Odessa, 1888) investigated the diffusion of
common salt by means of glass globules of definite density. Having poured water into a
cylinder over a layer of a solution of sodium chloride, he observed during a period of
several months the position (height) of the globules, which floated up higher and higher
as the salt permeated upwards. Umoff found that at a constant temperature the distances
of the globules (that is, the length of a column limited by layers of definite concentration)
remain constant; that at a given moment of time the concentration, <i>q</i>, of
different layers situated at a depth <i>z</i> is expressed by the equation B - K<i>z</i> = log.(A - <i>q</i>),
where A, B, and K are constants; that at a given moment the rate of diffusion of the

by the evaporation of the solution remaining after heating sodium iodate with hydrochloric
acid until chlorine ceases to be liberated, is a remarkable one. Its composition is
NaIO<sub>3</sub>,NaCl,14H<sub>2</sub>O. Rammelsberg obtained a similar (perhaps the same) salt in well-formed
crystals by the direct reaction of both salts.</p></div>

doubtless under the reducing action of the elements carbon and hydrogen. In the
presence of an excess of hydrochloric acid in the flame (when the sodium would form
sodium chloride), no sodium is formed in the flame and the salt does not communicate
its usual coloration.</p></div>

its aqueous solutions with the separation of sodium, and that it does not simply enter
into double decomposition with the water (NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O = NaHO + HCl). This is seen
from the fact that when a saturated solution of NaCl is rapidly decomposed by an electric
current, a large amount of chlorine appears at the anode and a sodium amalgam forms
at the mercury cathode, which acts but slowly upon the strong solution of salt.
Castner's process for the electrolysis of brine into chlorine and caustic soda is an
application of this method which has been already worked in England on an industrial
scale.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_594" id="Footnote_24_594"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_594"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> If MX and NY represent the molecules of two salts, and if there be <i>no third
substance</i> present (such as water in a solution), the formation of XY would also be
possible; for instance, cyanogen, iodine, &amp;c. are capable of combining with simple haloids,
as well as with the complex groups which in certain salts play the part of haloids. Besides
which the salts MX and NY or MY with NX may form double salts. If the number of
molecules be unequal, or if the valency of the elements or groups contained in them be
different, as in NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, where Cl is a univalent haloid and SO<sub>4</sub> is bivalent, then the
matter may be complicated by the formation of other compounds besides MY and NX, and
when a solvent participates in the action, and especially if present in large proportion, the
phenomena must evidently become still more complex; and this is actually the case in
nature. Hence while placing before the reader a certain portion of the existing store
of knowledge concerning the phenomena of double saline decompositions, I cannot consider
the theory of the subject as complete, and have therefore limited myself to a few
data, the completion of which must be sought in more detailed works on the subject of
theoretical chemistry, without losing sight of what has been said above.</p></div>

phenomenon in support of Berthollet's teaching, and it should not now be forgotten.
In double decompositions taking place in dilute solutions where the mass of water is
large, its influence, notwithstanding the weakness of affinities, must he great, according
to the very essence of Berthollet's doctrine.</p>

<p>As explaining the action of the mass of water, the experiments of Pattison Muir (1879)
are very instructive. These experiments demonstrate that the decomposition of bismuth
chloride is the more complete the greater the relative quantity of water, and the less the
mass of hydrochloric acid forming one of the products of the reaction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_598" id="Footnote_26_598"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_598"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> From the above it follows that an excess of acid should influence the reaction like
an excess of alcohol. It is in fact shown by experiment that if two molecules of
acetic acid be taken to one molecule of alcohol, 84 p.c. of alcohol is etherified. If with a
large preponderance of acid or of alcohol certain discrepancies are observed, their cause
must be looked for in the incomplete correspondence of the conditions and external
influences.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_599" id="Footnote_27_599"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_599"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> As an example two methods may be mentioned, Thomsen's and Ostwald's. Thomsen
(1869) applied a thermochemical method to exceedingly dilute solutions without taking
the water into further consideration. He took solutions of caustic soda containing
100H<sub>2</sub>O per NaHO, and sulphuric acid containing &frac12;H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 100H<sub>2</sub>O. In order that these
solutions may be mixed in such quantities that atomic proportions of acid and alkali would
act, for forty grams of caustic soda (which answers to its equivalent) there should
be employed 49 grams of sulphuric acid, and then +15,689 heat units would be evolved.
If the normal sodium sulphate so formed be mixed with <i>n</i> equivalents of sulphuric
acid, a certain amount of heat is absorbed, namely a quantity equal to

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>n</i>.1650</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">(<i>n</i> + 0·8)</span>
</span>

heat units. An equivalent of caustic soda, in combining with an equivalent of nitric acid,
evolves +13,617 units of heat, and the augmentation of the amount of nitric acid entails
an absorption of heat for each equivalent equal to -27 units; so also in combining with
hydrochloric acids +13,740 heat units are absorbed, and for each equivalent of hydrochloric
acid beyond this amount there are absorbed -32 heat units. Thomsen mixed
each one of three neutral salts, sodium sulphate, sodium chloride and sodium nitrate,
with an acid which is not contained in it; for instance, he mixed a solution of sodium
sulphate with a solution of nitric acid and determined the number of heat units then
absorbed. An absorption of heat ensued because a normal salt was taken in the
first instance, and the mixture of all the above normal salts with acid produces an
absorption of heat. The amount of heat absorbed enabled him to obtain an insight into
the process taking place in this mixture, for sulphuric acid added to sodium sulphate
absorbs a considerable quantity of heat, whilst hydrochloric and nitric acids absorb a
very small amount of heat in this case. By mixing an equivalent of sodium sulphate
with various numbers of equivalents of nitric acid, Thomsen observed that the amount of
heat absorbed increased more and more as the amount of nitric acid was increased; thus
when HNO<sub>3</sub> was taken per &frac12;Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 1,752 heat units were absorbed per equivalent of
soda contained in the sodium sulphate. When twice as much nitric acid was taken, 2,026
heat units, and when three times as much, 2,050 heat units were absorbed. Had the
double decomposition been complete in the case where one equivalent of nitric acid was
taken per equivalent of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> then according to calculation from similar data there
should have been absorbed -2,989 units of heat, while in reality only -1,752 units were
absorbed. Hence Thomsen concluded that a displacement of only about two-thirds of the
sulphuric acid had taken place&mdash;that is, the ratio <i>k</i> : <i>k</i>&#8242; for the reaction &frac12;Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + HNO<sub>3</sub>
and NaNO<sub>3</sub> + &frac12;H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is equal, as for ethereal salts, to 4. By taking this figure and admitting
the above supposition, Thomsen found that for all mixtures of soda with nitric
acid, and of sodium nitrate with sulphuric acid, the amounts of heat followed Guldberg and
Waage's law; that is, the limit of decomposition reached was greater the greater the
mass of acid added. The relation of hydrochloric to sulphuric acid gave the same results.
Therefore the researches of Thomsen fully confirm the hypotheses of Guldberg and
Waage and the doctrine of Berthollet.</p>

<p>Thomsen concludes his investigation with the words: (<i>a</i>) &lsquo;When equivalent
quantities of NaHO, HNO<sub>3</sub> (or HCl) and &frac12;H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> react on one another in an aqueous
solution, then two-thirds of the soda combines with the nitric and one-third with the
sulphuric acid; (<i>b</i>) this subdivision repeats itself, whether the soda be taken combined
with nitric or with sulphuric acid; (<i>c</i>) and therefore nitric acid has double the tendency
to combine with the base that sulphuric acid has, and hence in an aqueous solution
it is a stronger acid than the latter.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is therefore necessary,&rsquo; Thomsen afterwards remarks, &lsquo;to have an expression
indicating the tendency of an acid for the saturation of bases. This idea cannot be
expressed by the word <i>affinity</i>, because by this term is most often understood that force
which it is necessary to overcome in order to decompose a substance into its component
parts. This force should therefore be measured by the amount of work or heat employed
for the decomposition of the substance. The above-mentioned phenomenon is of an
entirely different nature,&rsquo; and Thomsen introduces the term <i>avidity</i>, by which he designates
the tendency of acids for neutralisation. &lsquo;Therefore the avidity of nitric acid with
respect to soda is twice as great as the avidity of sulphuric acid. An exactly similar
result is obtained with hydrochloric acid, so that its avidity with respect to soda is also
double the avidity of sulphuric acid. Experiments conducted with other acids showed
that not one of the acids investigated had so great an avidity as nitric acid; some had a
greater avidity than sulphuric acid, others less, and in some instances the avidity = 0.&rsquo;
The reader will naturally see clearly that the path chosen by Thomsen deserves to be
worked out, for his results concern important questions of chemistry, but great faith
cannot be placed in the deductions he has already arrived at, because great complexity
of relations is to be seen in the very method of his investigation. It is especially
important to turn attention to the fact that all the reactions investigated are reactions
of double decomposition. In them A and B do not combine with C and distribute themselves
according to their affinity or avidity for combination, but reversible reactions are
induced. MX and NY give MY and NX, and conversely; therefore the affinity or avidity
for combination is not here directly determined, but only the difference or relation of the
affinities or avidities. The affinity of nitric acid not only for the water of constitution,
but also for that serving for solution, is much less than that of sulphuric acid. This is
seen from thermal data. The reaction N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O gives +3,600 heat units, and the
solution of the resultant hydrate, 2NHO<sub>3</sub>, in a large excess of water evolves +14,986 heat
units. The formation of SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O evolves +21,308 heat units, and the solution of
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in an excess of water 17,860&mdash;that is, sulphuric acid gives more heat in both cases.
The interchange between Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and 2HNO<sub>3</sub> is not only accomplished at the expense of
the production of NaNO<sub>3</sub>, but also at the expense of the formation of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, hence the
affinity of sulphuric acid for water plays its part in the phenomena of displacement.
Therefore in determinations like those made by Thomsen the water does not form a
medium which is present without participating in the process; it also takes part in the
reaction. (Compare Chapter IX., Note <a href="#Footnote_14_524">14</a>.)</p>

<p>Whilst retaining essentially the methods of Thomsen, Ostwald (1876) determined the
variation of the sp. gr. (and afterwards of volume), proceeding in the same dilute solutions,
on the saturation of acids by bases, and in the decomposition of the salts of one acid by
the other, and arrived at conclusions of just the same nature as Thomsen's. Ostwald's
method will be clearly understood from an example. A solution of caustic soda containing
an almost molecular (40 grams) weight per litre had a specific gravity of 1·04051. The
specific gravities of solutions of equal volume and equivalent composition of sulphuric
and nitric acids were 1·02970 and 1·03084 respectively. On mixing the solutions of
NaHO and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> there was formed a solution of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> of sp. gr. 1·02959; hence
there ensued a decrease of specific gravity which we will term Q, equal to 1·04051
+ 1·02970 - 2(1·02959) = 0·01103. So also the specific gravity after mixture of the solutions
of NaHO and HNO<sub>3</sub> was 1·02633, and therefore Q = 0·01869. When one volume of the
solution of nitric acid was added to two volumes of the solution of sodium sulphate, a
solution of sp. gr. 1·02781 was obtained, and therefore the resultant decrease of sp. gr.</p>

<p class="title">Q<sub>1</sub> = 2(1·02959) + 1·03084 - 3(1·02781) = 0·00659.</p>

<p class="noindent">Had there been no chemical reaction between the salts, then according to Ostwald's
reasoning the specific gravity of the solutions would not have changed, and if the nitric
acid had entirely displaced the sulphuric acid Q<sub>2</sub> would be = 0·01869 - 0·01103 = 0·00766.
It is evident that a portion of the sulphuric acid was displaced by the nitric acid. But the
measure of displacement is not equal to the ratio between Q<sub>1</sub> and Q<sub>2</sub>, because a decrease
of sp. gr. also occurs on mixing the solution of sodium sulphate with sulphuric acid,
whilst the mixing of the solutions of sodium nitrate and nitric acid only produces a slight
variation of sp. gr. which falls within the limits of experimental error. Ostwald deduces
from similar data the same conclusions as Thomsen, and thus reconfirms the formula
deduced by Guldberg and Waage, and the teaching of Berthollet.</p>

<p>The participation of water is seen still more clearly in the methods adopted by
Ostwald than in those of Thomsen, because in the saturation of solutions of acids by
alkalis (which Kremers, Reinhold, and others had previously studied) there is observed,
not a contraction, as might have been expected from the quantity of heat which is then
evolved, but an expansion, of volume (a decrease of specific gravity, if we calculate as
Ostwald did in his first investigations). Thus by mixing 1,880 grams of a solution of
sulphuric acid of the composition SO<sub>3</sub> + 100H<sub>2</sub>O, occupying a volume of 1,815 c.c., with a
corresponding quantity of a solution 2(NaHO + 5H<sub>2</sub>O), whose volume = 1,793 c.c., we
obtain not 3,608 but 3,633 c.c., an expansion of 25 c.c. per gram molecule of the resulting
salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. It is the same in other cases. Nitric and hydrochloric acids give a still
greater expansion than sulphuric acid, and potassium hydroxide than sodium hydroxide,
whilst a solution of ammonia gives a contraction. The relation to water must be considered
as the cause of these phenomena. When sodium hydroxide and sulphuric acid
dissolve in water they develop heat and give a vigorous contraction; the water is separated
from such solutions with great difficulty. After mutual saturation they form the
salt Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, which retains the water but feebly and evolves but little heat with it, i.e., in
other words, has little affinity for water. In the saturation of sulphuric acid by soda the
water is, so to say, displaced from a stable combination and passes into an unstable combination;
hence an expansion (decrease of sp. gr.) takes place. It is not the reaction of
the acid on the alkali, but the reaction of water, that produces the phenomenon by which
Ostwald desires to measure the degree of salt formation. The water, which escaped
attention, itself has affinity, and influences those phenomena which are being investigated.
Furthermore, in the given instance its influence is very great because its mass is large.
When it is not present, or only present in small quantities, the attraction of the base to the
acid leads to contraction, and not expansion. Na<sub>2</sub>O has a sp. gr. 2·8, hence its molecular
volume = 22; the sp. gr. of SO<sub>3</sub> is 1·9 and volume 41, hence the sum of their volumes is 63;
for Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> the sp. gr. is 2·65 and volume 53·6, consequently there is a contraction of 10 c.c.
per gram-molecule of salt. The volume of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = 53·3, that of 2NaHO = 37·4; there is
produced 2H<sub>2</sub>O, volume = 36, + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, volume = 53·6. There react 90·7 c.c., and on saturation
there result 89·6 c.c.; consequently contraction again ensues, although less, and
although this reaction is one of substitution and not of combination. Consequently the
phenomena studied by Ostwald depend but little on the measure of the reaction of the
salts, and more on the relations of the dissolved substances to water. In substitutions,
for instance 2NaNO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = 2HNO<sub>3</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the volumes vary but slightly: in the
above example they are 2(38·8) + 53·3 and 2(41·2) + 53·6; hence 131 volumes act, and 136
volumes are produced. It may be concluded, therefore, on the basis of what has been said,
that on taking water into consideration the phenomena studied by Thomsen and Ostwald
are much more complex than they at first appear, and that this method can scarcely
lead to a correct interpretation as to the distribution of acids between bases. We
may add that P. D. Chroustcheff (1890) introduced a new method for this class of
research, by investigating the electro-conductivity of solutions and their mixtures, and
obtained remarkable results (for example, that hydrochloric acid almost entirely displaces
formic acid and only &#8532; of sulphuric acid), but details of these methods must be looked
for in text-books of theoretical chemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_600" id="Footnote_28_600"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_600"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> G. G. Gustavson's researches, which were conducted in the laboratory of the
St. Petersburg University in 1871&ndash;72, are among the first in which the measure of
the affinity of the elements for the halogens is recognised with perfect clearness in the limit
of substitution and in the rate of reaction. The researches conducted by A. L. Potilitzin
(of which mention will be made in Chapter XI., Note <a href="#Footnote_66_692">66</a>) in the same laboratory touch on
another aspect of the same problem which has not yet made much progress, notwithstanding
its importance and the fact that the theoretical side of the subject (thanks
especially to Guldberg and Van't Hoff) has since been rapidly pushed forward. If the researches
of Gustavson took account of the influence of mass, and were more fully
supplied with data concerning velocities and temperatures, they would be very important,
because of the great significance which the case considered has for the understanding of
double saline decompositions in the absence of water.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Gustavson showed that the greater the atomic weight of the element
(B, Si, Ti, As, Sn) combined <i>with chlorine</i> the greater the amount of chlorine replaced
by bromine by the action of CBr<sub>4</sub>, and consequently the less the amount of bromine
replaced by chlorine by the action of CCl<sub>4</sub> on bromine compounds. For instance, for
chlorine compounds the percentage of substitution (at the limit) is&mdash;</p>

<p>It should he observed, however, that Thorpe, on the basis of his experiments, denies
the universality of this conclusion. I may mention one conclusion which it appears to me
may be drawn from the above-cited figures of Gustavson, if they are subsequently verified
even within narrow limits. If CBr<sub>4</sub> be heated with RCl<sub>4</sub>, then an exchange of the bromine
for chlorine takes place. But what would be the result if it were mixed with CCl<sub>4</sub>?
Judging by the magnitude of the atomic weights, B = 11, C = 12, Si = 28, about 11 p.c. of
the chlorine would be replaced by bromine. But to what does this point? I think that
this shows the existence of a motion of the atoms in the molecule. The mixture of CCl<sub>4</sub>
and CBr<sub>4</sub> does not remain in a condition of static equilibrium; not only are the molecules
contained in it in a state of motion, but also the atoms in the molecules, and the above
figures show the measure of their translation under these conditions. The bromine in
the CBr<sub>4</sub> is, <i>within the limit</i>, substituted by the chlorine of the CCl<sub>4</sub> in a quantity of
about 11 out of 100: that is, a portion of the atoms of bromine previously to this moment
in combination with one atom of carbon pass over to the other atom of carbon, and the
chlorine passes over from this second atom of carbon to replace it. Therefore, also, in
the homogeneous mass CCl<sub>4</sub> all the atoms of Cl do not remain constantly combined with
the same atoms of carbon, and <i>there is on exchange of atoms between different molecules
in a homogeneous medium also</i>. This hypothesis may in my opinion explain
certain phenomena of dissociation, but though mentioning it I do not consider it worth
while to dwell upon it. I will only observe that a similar hypothesis suggested itself to
me in my researches on solutions, and that Pfaundler enunciated an essentially similar
hypothesis, and in recent times a like view is beginning to find favour with respect to the
electrolysis of saline solutions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_601" id="Footnote_29_601"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_601"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Berthollet's doctrine is hardly at all affected in principle by showing that there are
cases in which there is no decomposition between salts, because the affinity may be so
small that even a large mass would still give no observable displacements. The fundamental
condition for the application of Berthollet's doctrine, as well as Deville's doctrine
of dissociation, lies in the reversibility of reactions. There are practically irreversible
reactions (for instance, CCl<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = CO<sub>2</sub> + 4HCl), just as there are non-volatile substances.
But while accepting the doctrine of reversible reactions and retaining the
theory of the evaporation of liquids, it is possible to admit the existence of non-volatile
substances, and in just the same way of reactions, without any visible conformity to
Berthollet's doctrine. This doctrine evidently comes nearer than the opposite doctrine
of Bergmann to solving the complex problems of chemical mechanics for the successful
solution of which at the present time the most valuable help is to be expected from the
working out of data concerning dissociation, the influence of mass, and the equilibrium
and velocity of reactions. But it is evident that from this point of view we must not
regard a solvent as a non-participant space, but must take into consideration the
chemical reactions accompanying solution, or else bring about reactions without solution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_602" id="Footnote_30_602"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_602"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Common salt not only enters into double decomposition with acids but also <i>with
every salt</i>. However, as clearly follows from Berthollet's doctrine, this form of decomposition
will only in a few cases render it possible for new metallic chlorides to be obtained,
because the decomposition will not be carried on to the end unless the metallic
chloride formed separates from the mass of the active substances. Thus, for example,
if a solution of common salt be mixed with a solution of magnesium sulphate, double
decomposition ensues, but not completely, because all the substances remain in the solution.
In this case the decomposition must result in the formation of sodium sulphate and
magnesium chloride, substances which are soluble in water; nothing is disengaged, and
therefore the decomposition 2NaCl + MgSO<sub>4</sub> = MgCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> cannot proceed to the end.
However, the sodium sulphate formed in this manner may be separated by freezing the
mixture. The complete separation of the sodium sulphate will naturally not take place,
owing to a portion of the salt remaining in the solution. Nevertheless, this kind of
decomposition is made use of for the preparation of sodium sulphate from the residues
left after the evaporation of sea-water, which contain a mixture of magnesium sulphate
and common salt. Such a mixture is found at Stassfurt in a natural form. It might be
said that this form of double decomposition is only accomplished with a change of temperature;
but this would not be true, as may be concluded from other analogous cases.
Thus, for instance, a solution of copper sulphate is of a blue colour, while a solution of
copper chloride is green. If we mix the two salts together the green tint is distinctly
visible, so that by this means the presence of the copper chloride in the solution of copper
sulphate is clearly seen. If now we add a solution of common salt to a solution of copper
sulphate, a green coloration is obtained, which indicates the formation of copper chloride.
In this instance it is not separated, but it is immediately formed on the addition of
common salt, as it should be according to Berthollet's doctrine.</p>

<p>The complete formation of a metallic chloride from common salt can only occur,
judging from the above, when it separates from the sphere of action. The salts of silver
are instances in point, because the silver chloride is insoluble in water; and therefore
if we add a solution of sodium chloride to a solution of a silver salt, silver chloride and
the sodium salt of that acid which was in the silver salt are formed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_603" id="Footnote_31_603"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_603"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> The apparatus shown in fig. <a href="#fig_46">46</a> (Chapter VI., Note <a href="#Footnote_12_337">12</a>) is generally employed for the
preparation of small quantities of hydrochloric acid. Common salt is placed in the retort;
the salt is generally previously fused, as it otherwise froths and boils over in the apparatus.
When the apparatus is placed in order sulphuric acid mixed with water is poured down
the thistle funnel into the retort. Strong sulphuric acid (about half as much again as
the weight of the salt) is usually taken, and it is diluted with a small quantity of water
(half) if it be desired to retard the action, as in using strong sulphuric acid the action
immediately begins with great vigour. The mixture, at first without the aid of heat and
then at a moderate temperature (in a water-bath), evolves hydrochloric acid. Commercial
hydrochloric acid contains many impurities; it is usually purified by distillation, the
middle portions being collected. It is purified from arsenic by adding FeCl<sub>2</sub>, distilling,
and rejecting the first third of the distillate. If free hydrochloric acid gas be required,
it is passed through a vessel containing strong sulphuric acid to dry it, and is collected

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_605" id="Footnote_32_605"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_605"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> As in works which treat common salt in order to obtain sodium sulphate, the
hydrochloric acid is sometimes held to be of no value, it might be allowed to escape with
the waste furnace gases into the atmosphere, which would greatly injure the air of
the neighbourhood and destroy all vegetation. In all countries, therefore, there are laws
forbidding the factories to proceed in this manner, and requiring the absorption of the
hydrochloric acid by water at the works themselves, and not permitting the solution to
be run into rivers and streams, whose waters it would spoil. It may be remarked that
the absorption of hydrochloric acid presents no particular difficulties (the absorption of
sulphurous acid is much more difficult) because hydrochloric acid has a great affinity for
water and gives a hydrate which boils above 100°. Hence, even steam and hot water, as
well as weaker solutions, can be used for absorbing the acid. However, Warder (1888)
showed that weak solutions of composition H<sub>2</sub>O + <i>n</i>HCl when boiled (the residue will be
almost HCl,8H<sub>2</sub>O) evolve (not water but) a solution of the composition H<sub>2</sub>O + 445<i>n</i><sup>4</sup>HCl;
for example, on distilling HCl,10H<sub>2</sub>O, HCl,23H<sub>2</sub>O is first obtained in the distillate. As
the strength of the residue becomes greater, so also does that of the distillate, and therefore
in order to completely absorb hydrochloric acid it is necessary in the end to have
recourse to water.</p>

<p>As in Russia the manufacture of sodium sulphate from sodium chloride has not yet
been sufficiently developed, and as hydrochloric acid is required for many technical purposes
(for instance, for the preparation of zinc chloride, which is employed for soaking
railway sleepers), therefore salt is often treated mainly for the manufacture of hydrochloric
acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_606" id="Footnote_33_606"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_606"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Thus the metallic chlorides, which are decomposed to a greater or less degree by
water, correspond with feeble bases. Such are, for example, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, AlCl<sub>3</sub>, SbCl<sub>3</sub>, BiCl<sub>3</sub>.
The decomposition of magnesium chloride (and also carnallite) by sulphuric acid proceeds
at the ordinary temperature; water decomposes MgCl<sub>2</sub> to the extent of 50 p.c.
when aided by heat, and <i>may be employed</i> as a convenient <i>method for the production
of hydrochloric acid</i>. Hydrochloric acid is also produced by the ignition of certain
metallic chlorides in a stream of hydrogen, especially of those metals which are easily
reduced and difficultly oxidised&mdash;for instance, silver chloride. Lead chloride, when
heated to redness in a current of steam, gives hydrochloric acid and lead oxide. The
multitude of the cases of formation of hydrochloric acid are understood from the
fact that it is a substance which is comparatively very stable, resembling water in this
respect, and even most probably more stable than water, because, at a high temperature
and even under the action of light, chlorine decomposes water, with the formation of
hydrochloric acid. The combination of chlorine and hydrogen also proceeds by their
direct action, as we shall afterwards describe.</p></div>

<p>Although hydrochloric acid, like water, is one of the most stable
substances, it is nevertheless decomposed not only by the action of a
galvanic current,<a name="FNanchor_1_620" id="FNanchor_1_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_620" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> but also by a high temperature. Sainte-Claire Deville
showed that decomposition already occurs at 1,300°, because a cold
tube (as with CO, Chapter <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>.) covered with an amalgam of silver absorbs
chlorine from hydrochloric acid in a red-hot tube, and the escaping
gas contains hydrogen. V. Meyer and Langer (1885) observed the decomposition
of hydrochloric acid at 1,690° in a platinum vessel; the
decomposition in this instance was proved not only from the fact
that hydrogen diffused through the platinum (p. <a href="#Page_142">142</a>), owing to which
the volume was diminished, but also from chlorine being obtained in
the residue (the hydrogen chloride was mixed with nitrogen), which
liberated iodine from potassium iodide.<a name="FNanchor_2_621" id="FNanchor_2_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_621" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The usual method for the
preparation of chlorine consists in the abstraction of the hydrogen by
oxidising agents.<a name="FNanchor_2_BIS_622" id="FNanchor_2_BIS_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_BIS_622" class="fnanchor">[2 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span></p>

<p>An aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid is generally employed for
the evolution of chlorine. The hydrogen has to be abstracted from
the hydrochloric acid. This is accomplished by nearly all oxidising
substances, and especially by those which are able to evolve oxygen at
a red heat (besides bases, such as mercury and silver oxides, which are
able to give salts with hydrogen chloride); for example, manganese
peroxide, potassium chlorate, chromic acid, &amp;c. The decomposition
essentially consists in the oxygen of the oxidising substance displacing
the chlorine from 2HCl, forming water, H<sub>2</sub>O, and setting the
chlorine free, 2HCl + O (disengaged by the oxidising substances)
= H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub>. Even nitric acid partially produces a like reaction;
but as we shall afterwards see its action is more complicated, and
it is therefore not suitable for the preparation of pure chlorine.<a name="FNanchor_3_623" id="FNanchor_3_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_623" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
But other oxidising substances which do not give any other volatile
products with hydrochloric acid may be employed for the preparation
of chlorine. Among these may be mentioned: potassium chlorate,
acid potassium chromate, sodium manganate, manganese peroxide, &amp;c.
Manganese peroxide is commonly employed in the laboratory, and on
a large scale, for the preparation of chlorine. The chemical process
in this case may be represented as follows: an exchange takes place
between 4HCl and MnO<sub>2</sub>, in which the manganese takes the place
of the four atoms of hydrogen, or the chlorine and oxygen exchange
places&mdash;that is, MnCl<sub>4</sub> and 2H<sub>2</sub>O are produced. The chlorine compound,
MnCl<sub>4</sub>, obtained is very unstable; it splits up into chlorine,
which as a gas passes from the sphere of action, and a lower compound
containing less chlorine than the substance first formed, which remains
in the apparatus in which the mixture is heated, MnCl<sub>4</sub> = MnCl<sub>2</sub>
+ Cl<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_3_BIS_624" id="FNanchor_3_BIS_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_BIS_624" class="fnanchor">[3 bis]</a> The action of hydrochloric acid requires a temperature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>

Chlorine cannot be collected over mercury, because it combines with
it as with many other metals, and it is soluble in water; however, it
is but slightly soluble in hot water or brine. Owing to its great
weight, chlorine may be directly collected in a dry vessel by carrying
the gas-conducting tube down to the bottom of the vessel. The chlorine
will lie in a heavy layer at the bottom of the vessel, displace the air,
and the extent to which it fills the vessel may be followed by its colour.<a name="FNanchor_6_627" id="FNanchor_6_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_627" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Chlorine is a <i>gas</i> of a yellowish green colour, and has a very
suffocating and characteristic odour. On lowering the temperature to
-50° or increasing the pressure to six atmospheres (at 0°) chlorine
condenses<a name="FNanchor_7_628" id="FNanchor_7_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_628" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> into a liquid which has a yellowish-green colour, a
density of 1·3, and boils at -34°. The density and atomic weight of
chlorine is 35·5 times greater than that of hydrogen, hence the molecule
contains Cl<sub>2</sub><a name="FNanchor_8_629" id="FNanchor_8_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_629" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>. At 0° one volume of water dissolves about 1&frac12; volume
of chlorine, at 10° about 3 volumes, at 50° again 1&frac12; volume.<a name="FNanchor_9_630" id="FNanchor_9_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_630" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
a solution of chlorine is termed &lsquo;chlorine water;&rsquo; and is employed in
a diluted form in medicine and as a laboratory reagent. It is prepared
by passing chlorine through a series of Woulfe's bottles or into
an inverted retort filled with water. Under the action of light, chlorine
water gives oxygen and hydrochloric acid. At 0° a saturated solution
of chlorine yields a crystallo-hydrate, Cl<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O, which easily splits up
into chlorine and water when heated, so that if it be sealed up in a tube
and heated to 35°, two layers of liquid are formed&mdash;a lower stratum
of chlorine containing a small quantity of water, and an upper stratum
of water containing a small quantity of chlorine.<a name="FNanchor_10_631" id="FNanchor_10_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_631" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Chlorine explodes <i>with hydrogen</i>, if a mixture of equal volumes be
exposed to the direct action of the sun's rays<a name="FNanchor_11_632" id="FNanchor_11_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_632" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> or brought into contact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
with spongy platinum, or a strongly heated substance, or when subjected
to the action of an electric spark. The explosion in this case takes place
for exactly the same reasons&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the evolution of heat and expansion of
the resultant product&mdash;as in the case of detonating gas (Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>.)
Diffused light acts in the same way, but slowly, whilst direct sunlight
causes an explosion.<a name="FNanchor_12_633" id="FNanchor_12_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_633" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The hydrochloric acid gas produced by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
reaction of chlorine on hydrogen occupies (at the original temperature
and pressure) a volume equal to the sum of the original volumes; that
is, a reaction of substitution here takes place: H<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> = HCl + HCl.
In this reaction twenty-two thousand heat units are evolved for one
part by weight [1 gram] of hydrogen.<a name="FNanchor_13_634" id="FNanchor_13_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_634" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>These relations show that the affinity of chlorine for hydrogen is
very great and analogous to the affinity between hydrogen and oxygen.
Thus<a name="FNanchor_14_635" id="FNanchor_14_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_635" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> on the one hand by passing a mixture of steam and chlorine
through a red-hot tube, or by exposing water and chlorine to the sunlight,
oxygen is disengaged, whilst on the other hand, as we saw above,
oxygen in many cases displaces chlorine from its compound with
hydrogen, and therefore the reaction H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub> = 2HCl + O belongs
to the number of reversible reactions, and hydrogen will distribute
itself between oxygen and chlorine. This determines the relation
of Cl to substances containing hydrogen and its reactions in the
presence of water, to which we shall turn our attention after
having pointed out the relation of chlorine to other elements.</p>

<p>Many <i>metals</i> when brought into contact with chlorine immediately
combine with it, and form those metallic chlorides which correspond
with hydrogen chloride and with the oxide of the metal taken. This
combination may proceed rapidly with the evolution of heat and
light; that is, metals are able to burn in chlorine. Thus, for example,
sodium<a name="FNanchor_15_636" id="FNanchor_15_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_636" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> burns in chlorine, synthesising common salt. Metals in the
form of powders burn without the aid of heat, and become highly
incandescent in the process; for instance, antimony, which is a metal
easily converted into a powder.<a name="FNanchor_16_637" id="FNanchor_16_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_637" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Even such metals as gold and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
platinum,<a name="FNanchor_17_638" id="FNanchor_17_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_638" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> which do not combine directly with oxygen and give very
unstable compounds with it, unite directly with chlorine to form
metallic chlorides. Either chlorine water or aqua regia may be employed
for this purpose instead of gaseous chlorine. These dissolve
gold and platinum, converting them into metallic chlorides. <i>Aqua
regia</i> is a mixture of 1 part of nitric acid with 2 to 3 parts of hydrochloric
acid. This mixture converts into soluble chlorides not only
those metals which are acted on by hydrochloric and nitric acids, but
also gold and platinum, which are insoluble in either acid separately.
This action of aqua regia depends on the fact that nitric acid in acting
on hydrochloric acid evolves chlorine. If the chlorine evolved be
transferred to a metal, then a fresh quantity is formed from the
remaining acids and also combines with the metal.<a name="FNanchor_18_639" id="FNanchor_18_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_639" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Thus the aqua
regia acts by virtue of the chlorine which it contains and disengages.</p>

<p>The majority of <i>non-metals</i> also react directly on chlorine; hot
sulphur and phosphorus burn in it and combine with it at the ordinary
temperature. Only nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen do not combine
directly with it. The chlorine compounds formed by the non-metals&mdash;for
instance, phosphorus trichloride, PCl<sub>3</sub>, and sulphurous chloride,
&amp;c., do not have the properties of salts, and, as we shall afterwards see
more fully, correspond to acid anhydrides and acids; for example, PCl<sub>3</sub>&mdash;to
phosphorous acid, P(OH)<sub>3</sub>:</p>

<p>The chloranhydrides MCl corresponding to the bases are evidently
metallic chlorides or salts corresponding to HCl. In this manner a
distinct equivalency is marked between the compounds of chlorine and
the so-called hydroxyl radicle (HO), which is also expressed in the
analogy existing between chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, and hydrogen peroxide, (HO)<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>As regards the chloranhydrides corresponding to acids and non-metals,
they bear but little resemblance to metallic salts. They are
nearly all volatile, and have a powerful suffocating smell which irritates
the eyes and respiratory organs. They react on water like many
anhydrides of the acids, with the evolution of heat and liberation of
hydrochloric acid, forming acid hydrates. For this reason they cannot
usually be obtained from hydrates&mdash;that is, acids&mdash;by the action of
hydrochloric acid, as in that case water would be formed together with
them, and water decomposes them, converting them into hydrates. There
are many intermediate chlorine compounds between true saline metallic
chlorides like sodium chloride and true acid chloranhydrides, just as
there are all kinds of transitions between bases and acids. Acid
chloranhydrides are not only obtained from chlorine and non-metals,
but also from many lower oxides, by the aid of chlorine. Thus, for
example, CO, NO, NO<sub>2</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, and other lower oxides which are
capable of combining with oxygen may also combine with a corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
quantity of chlorine. Thus COCl<sub>2</sub>, NOCl, NO<sub>2</sub>Cl, SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>,
&amp;c., are obtained. They correspond with the hydrates CO(OH)<sub>2</sub>,
NO(OH), NO<sub>2</sub>(OH), SO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c., and to the anhydrides CO<sub>2</sub>,
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, SO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. Here we should notice two aspects of the
matter: (1) chlorine combines with that with which oxygen is able to
combine, because it is in many respects equally if not more energetic
than oxygen and replaces it in the proportion Cl<sub>2</sub>: O; (2) that highest
limit of possible combination which is proper to a given element or
grouping of elements is very easily and often attained by combination
with chlorine. If phosphorus gives PCl<sub>3</sub> and PCl<sub>5</sub>, it is evident that
PCl<sub>5</sub> is the higher form of combination compared with PCl<sub>3</sub>. To the
form PCl<sub>5</sub>, or in general PX<sub>5</sub>, correspond PH<sub>4</sub>I, PO(OH)<sub>3</sub>, POCl<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.
If chlorine does not always directly give compounds of the highest
possible forms for a given element, then generally the lower forms
combine with it in order to reach or approach the limit. This is
particularly clear in hydrocarbons, where we see the limit C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>
very distinctly. The unsaturated hydrocarbons are sometimes able to
combine with chlorine with the greatest ease and thus reach the limit.
Thus ethylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>, combines with Cl<sub>2</sub>, forming the so-called Dutch
liquid or ethylene chloride, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, because it then reaches the limit
C<sub><i>n</i></sub>X<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub>. In this and all similar cases the combined chlorine is able by
reactions of substitution to give a hydroxide and a whole series of other
derivatives. Thus a hydroxide called glycol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, is obtained
from C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Chlorine <i>in the presence of water</i> very often acts directly <i>as an
oxidising agent</i>. A substance A combines with chlorine and gives, for
example, ACl<sub>2</sub>, and this in turn a hydroxide, A(OH)<sub>2</sub>, which on losing
water forms AO. Here the chlorine has oxidised the substance A. This
frequently happens in the simultaneous action of water and chlorine:
A + H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub> = 2HCl + AO. Examples of this oxidising action of
chlorine may frequently be observed both in practical chemistry and
technical processes. Thus, for instance, chlorine in the presence of
water oxidises sulphur and metallic sulphides. In this case the
sulphur is converted into sulphuric acid, and the chlorine into hydrochloric
acid, or a metallic chloride if a metallic sulphide be taken. A
mixture of carbonic oxide and chlorine passed into water gives carbonic
anhydride and hydrochloric acid. Sulphurous anhydride is oxidised
by chlorine in the presence of water into sulphuric acid, just as it is
by the action of nitric acid: SO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2HCl.</p>

<p>The oxidising action of chlorine in the presence of water is taken
advantage of in practice for the rapid bleaching of tissues and fibres.
The colouring matter of the fibres is altered by oxidation and converted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
into a colourless substance, but the chlorine afterwards
acts on the tissue itself. Bleaching by means of chlorine therefore
requires a certain amount of technical skill in order that the chlorine
should not act on the fibres themselves, but that its action should be
limited to the colouring matter only. The fibre for making writing
paper, for instance, is bleached in this manner. The bleaching
property of chlorine was discovered by Berthollet, and forms an
important acquisition to the arts, because it has in the majority of
cases replaced that which before was the universal method of bleaching&mdash;namely,
exposure to the sun of the fabrics damped with water,
which is still employed for linens, &amp;c. Time and great trouble, and
therefore money also, have been considerably saved by this change.<a name="FNanchor_19_640" id="FNanchor_19_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_640" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>The power of chlorine for combination is intimately connected with
its capacity for substitution, because, according to the law of substitution,
if chlorine combines with hydrogen, then it also replaces hydrogen,
and furthermore the combination and substitution are accomplished in
the same quantities. Therefore <i>the atom of chlorine</i> which combines
with the atom of hydrogen is also able <i>to replace the atom of hydrogen</i>.
We mention this property of chlorine not only because it illustrates
the application of the law of substitution in clear and historically
important examples, but more especially because reactions of this kind
explain those <i>indirect methods</i> of the formation of many substances
which we have often mentioned and to which recourse is had in many
cases in chemistry. Thus chlorine does not act on carbon,<a name="FNanchor_20_641" id="FNanchor_20_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_641" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> oxygen,
or nitrogen, but nevertheless its compounds with these elements may
be obtained by the indirect method of the substitution of hydrogen
by chlorine.</p>

<p>As chlorine easily combines with hydrogen, and does not act on
carbon, it decomposes hydrocarbons (and many of their derivatives) at
a high temperature, depriving them of their hydrogen and liberating
the carbon, as, for example, is clearly seen when a lighted candle is
placed in a vessel containing chlorine. The flame becomes smaller, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
continues to burn for a certain time, a large amount of soot is obtained,
and hydrochloric acid is formed. In this case the gaseous and incandescent
substances of the flame are decomposed by the chlorine, the
hydrogen combines with it, and the carbon is disengaged as soot.<a name="FNanchor_21_642" id="FNanchor_21_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_642" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
This action of chlorine on hydrocarbons, &amp;c., proceeds otherwise at
lower temperatures, as we will now consider.</p>

<p>A very important epoch in the history of chemistry was inaugurated
by the discovery of Dumas and Laurent that chlorine is able to displace
and <i>replace hydrogen</i>. This discovery is important from the fact that
chlorine proved to be an element which combines with great ease
simultaneously with both the hydrogen and the element with which
the hydrogen was combined. This clearly proved that there is no
opposite polarity between elements forming stable compounds. Chlorine
does not combine with hydrogen because it has opposite properties, as
Dumas and Laurent stated previously, accounting hydrogen to be
electro-positive and chlorine electro-negative; this is not the reason of
their combining together, for the same chlorine which combines with
hydrogen is also able to replace it without altering many of the
properties of the resultant substance. This substitution of hydrogen
by chlorine is termed <i>metalepsis</i>. The mechanism of this substitution
is very constant. If we take a hydrogen compound, preferably a
hydrocarbon, and if chlorine acts directly on it, then there is produced
on the one hand hydrochloric acid and on the other hand a compound
containing chlorine in the place of the hydrogen&mdash;so that the chlorine
divides itself into two equal portions, one portion is evolved as hydrochloric
acid, and the other portion takes the place of the hydrogen
thus liberated. <i>Hence this metalepsis is always accompanied by the
formation of hydrochloric acid.</i><a name="FNanchor_22_643" id="FNanchor_22_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_643" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The scheme of the process is as
follows:</p>

<p>The conditions under which metalepsis takes place are also very
constant. In the dark chlorine does not usually act on hydrogen compounds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
but the action commences under the influence of light. The
direct action of the sun's rays is particularly propitious to metalepsis.
It is also remarkable that the presence of traces of certain substances,<a name="FNanchor_23_644" id="FNanchor_23_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_644" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
especially of iodine, aluminium chloride, antimony chloride, &amp;c., promotes
the action. A trace of iodine added to the substance subjected to
metalepsis often produces the same effect as sunlight.<a name="FNanchor_24_645" id="FNanchor_24_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_645" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>If marsh gas be mixed with chlorine and the mixture ignited, then
the hydrogen is entirely taken up from the marsh gas and hydrochloric
acid and carbon formed, but there is no metalepsis.<a name="FNanchor_25_646" id="FNanchor_25_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_646" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But if a
mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and marsh gas be exposed to the
action of diffused light, then the greenish yellow mixture gradually
becomes colourless, and hydrochloric acid and the first product of
metalepsis&mdash;namely, methyl chloride&mdash;are formed:</p>

<p>The volume of the mixture remains unaltered. The methyl
chloride which is formed is a gas. If it be separated from the hydrochloric
acid (it is soluble in acetic acid, in which hydrochloric acid is but
sparingly soluble) and be again mixed with chlorine, then it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
subjected to a further metalepsical substitution&mdash;the second atom of
hydrogen may be substituted by chlorine, and a liquid substance,
CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, called methylene chloride, will be obtained. In the same
manner the substitution may be carried on still further, and CHCl<sub>3</sub>,
or chloroform, and lastly carbon tetrachloride, CCl<sub>4</sub>, will be produced.
Of these substances the best known is chloroform, owing to its being
formed from many organic substances (by the action of bleaching
powder) and to its being used in medicine as an anæsthetic; chloroform
boils at 62° and carbon tetrachloride at 78°. They are both colourless
odoriferous liquids, heavier than water. The progressive substitution
of hydrogen by chlorine is thus evident, and it can be clearly seen that
the double decompositions are accomplished between molecular quantities
of the substance&mdash;that is, between equal volumes in a gaseous state.</p>

<p><i>Carbon tetrachloride</i>, which is obtained by the metalepsis of marsh
gas, cannot be obtained directly from chlorine and carbon, but it may be
obtained from certain compounds of carbon&mdash;for instance, from carbon
bisulphide&mdash;if its vapour mixed with chlorine be passed through a
red-hot tube. Both the sulphur and carbon then combine with the
chlorine. It is evident that by ultimate metalepsis a corresponding
carbon chloride may be obtained from any hydrocarbon&mdash;indeed, the
number of chlorides of carbon C<sub><i>n</i></sub>Cl<sub>2<i>m</i></sub> already known is very large.</p>

<p>As a rule, the fundamental chemical characters of hydrocarbons are
not changed by metalepsis; that is, if a neutral substance be taken, then
the product of metalepsis is also a neutral substance, or if an acid be
taken the product of metalepsis also has acid properties. Even the
crystalline form not unfrequently remains unaltered after metalepsis.
The metalepsis of acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>·COOH, is historically the most
important. It contains three of the atoms of the hydrogen of marsh
gas, the fourth being replaced by carboxyl, and therefore by the action
of chlorine it gives three products of metalepsis (according to the amount
of the chlorine and conditions under which the reaction takes place),
mono-, di-, and tri-chloracetic acids&mdash;CH<sub>2</sub>Cl·COOH, CHCl<sub>2</sub>·COOH, and
CCl<sub>3</sub>·COOH; they are all, like acetic acid, monobasic. The resulting
products of metalepsis, in containing an element which so easily acts
on metals as chlorine, possess the possibility of attaining a further complexity
of molecules of which the original hydrocarbon is often in no
way capable. Thus on treating with an alkali (or first with a salt and
then with an alkali, or with a basic oxide and water, &amp;c.) the chlorine
forms a salt with its metal, and the hydroxyl radicle takes the place of
the chlorine&mdash;for example, CH<sub>3</sub>·OH is obtained from CH<sub>3</sub>Cl. By the
action of metallic derivatives of hydrocarbons&mdash;for example, CH<sub>3</sub>Na&mdash;the
chlorine also gives a salt, and the hydrocarbon radicle&mdash;for instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
CH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;takes the place of the chlorine. In this, or in a similar manner,
CH<sub>3</sub>·CH<sub>3</sub>, or C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> is obtained from CH<sub>3</sub>Cl and C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·CH<sub>3</sub> from C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>.
The products of metalepsis also often react on ammonia, forming hydrochloric
acid (and thence NH<sub>4</sub>Cl) and an amide; that is, the product of
metalepsis, with the ammonia radicle NH<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c. in the place of chlorine.
Thus by means of metalepsical substitution methods were found in
chemistry for an artificial and general means of the formation of complex
carbon compounds from more simple compounds which are often
totally incapable of direct reaction. Besides which, this key opened
the doors of that secret edifice of complex organic compounds into
which man had up to then feared to enter, supposing the hydrocarbon
elements to be united only under the influence of those mystic forces
acting in organisms.<a name="FNanchor_26_647" id="FNanchor_26_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_647" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>It is not only hydrocarbons which are subject to metalepsis.
Certain other hydrogen compounds, under the action of chlorine, also
give corresponding chlorine derivatives in exactly the same manner;
for instance, ammonia, caustic potash, caustic lime, and a whole series
of <i>alkaline</i> substances.<a name="FNanchor_27_648" id="FNanchor_27_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_648" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In fact, just as the hydrogen in marsh gas
can be replaced by chlorine and form methyl chloride, so the hydrogen
in caustic potash, KHO, ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, and calcium hydroxide,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, may be replaced by chlorine and give potassium
hypochlorite, KClO, calcium hypochlorite, CaCl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and the so-called
chloride of nitrogen, NCl<sub>3</sub>. For not only is the correlation in composition
the same as in the substitution in marsh gas, but the whole mechanism
of the reaction is the same. Here also two atoms of chlorine act:
one takes the place of the hydrogen whilst the other is evolved as
hydrochloric acid, only in the former case the hydrochloric acid evolved
remained free, and in the latter, in presence of alkaline substances,
it reacts on them. Thus, in the action of chlorine on caustic
potash, the hydrochloric acid formed acts on another quantity of caustic
potash and gives potassium chloride and water, and therefore not only
KHO + Cl<sub>2</sub> = HCl + KClO, but also KHO + HCl = H<sub>2</sub>O + KCl,
and the result of both simultaneous phases will be 2KHO + Cl<sub>2</sub>
= H<sub>2</sub>O + KCl + KClO. We will here discuss certain special
cases.</p>

<p>The action of chlorine on ammonia may either result in the entire
breaking up of the ammonia, with the evolution of gaseous nitrogen,
or in a product of metalepsis (as with CH<sub>4</sub>). With an excess of
chlorine and the aid of heat the ammonia is decomposed, with the
disengagement of free nitrogen.<a name="FNanchor_28_649" id="FNanchor_28_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_649" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> This reaction evidently results
in the formation of sal-ammoniac, 8NH<sub>3</sub> + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> = 6NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + N<sub>2</sub>.
But if the ammonium salt be in excess, then the reaction takes the
direction of the replacement of the hydrogen in the ammonia by chlorine.
The principal result is that NH<sub>3</sub> + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> forms NCl<sub>3</sub> + 3HCl.<a name="FNanchor_29_650" id="FNanchor_29_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_650" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
The resulting product of metalepsis, or <i>chloride of nitrogen</i>, NCl<sub>3</sub>,
discovered by Dulong, is a liquid having the property of decomposing
with excessive ease not only when heated, but even under the action
of mechanical influences, as by a blow or by contact with certain solid
substances. The explosion which accompanies the decomposition is due
to the fact that the liquid chloride of nitrogen gives gaseous products,
nitrogen and chlorine.<a name="FNanchor_29_BIS_651" id="FNanchor_29_BIS_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_BIS_651" class="fnanchor">[29 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span></p>

<p>Chloride of nitrogen is a yellow oily liquid of sp. gr. 1·65, which
boils at 71°, and breaks up into N + Cl<sub>3</sub> at 97°. The contact of
phosphorus, turpentine, india-rubber, &amp;c. causes an explosion, which
is sometimes so violent that a small drop will pierce through a thick
board. The great ease with which chloride of nitrogen decomposes is
dependent upon the fact that it is formed with an absorption of heat,
which it evolves when decomposed, to the amount of about 38,000 heat
units for NCl<sub>3</sub>, as Deville and Hautefeuille determined.</p>

<p>Chlorine, when absorbed by a solution of caustic soda (and also of
other alkalis) at the ordinary temperature, causes the replacement of
the hydrogen in the caustic soda by the chlorine, with the formation
of sodium chloride by the hydrochloric acid, so that the reaction
may be represented in two phases, as described above. In this
manner, sodium hypochlorite, NaClO, and sodium chloride are simultaneously
formed: 2NaHO + Cl<sub>2</sub> = NaCl + NaClO + H<sub>2</sub>O. The
resultant solution contains NaClO and is termed &lsquo;eau de Javelle.&rsquo; An
exactly similar reaction takes place when chlorine is passed over dry
hydrate of lime at the ordinary temperature: 2Ca(HO)<sub>2</sub> + 2Cl<sub>2</sub>
= CaCl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. A mixture of the product of metalepsis
with calcium chloride is obtained. This mixture is employed in practice
on a large scale, and is termed &lsquo;bleaching powder,&rsquo; owing to its acting,
especially when mixed with acids, as a bleaching agent on tissues, so
that it resembles chlorine in this respect. It is however preferable
to chlorine, because the destructive action of the chlorine can be
moderated in this case, and because it is much more convenient to deal
with a solid substance than with gaseous chlorine. Bleaching powder
is also called <i>chloride of lime</i>, because it is obtained from chlorine
and hydrate of lime, and contains<a name="FNanchor_30_652" id="FNanchor_30_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_652" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> both these substances. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
may be prepared in the laboratory by passing a current of chlorine
through a cold mixture of water and lime (milk of lime). The mixture
must be kept cold, as otherwise 3Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub> passes into 2CaCl<sub>2</sub>
+ Ca(ClO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. In the manufacture of bleaching powder in large
quantities at chemical works, the purest possible slaked lime is taken
and laid in a thin layer in large flat chambers, M (whose walls are
made of Yorkshire flags or tarred wood, on which chlorine has no
action), and into which chlorine gas is introduced by lead tubes. The
distribution of the plant is shown in the annexed drawing (fig. <a href="#fig_67">67</a>).</p>

<p>The products of the metalepsis of alkaline hydrates, NaClO and
Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub>, which are present in solutions of &lsquo;Javelle salt&rsquo; and bleaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
powder (they are not obtained free from metallic chlorides), must be
counted as salts, because their metals are capable of substitution. But
the hydrate HClO corresponding with these salts, or <i>hypochlorous
acid</i>, is not obtained in a free or pure state, for two reasons: in the
first place, because this hydrate, as a very feeble acid, splits up (like
H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> or HNO<sub>3</sub>) into water and the anhydride, or <i>chlorine monoxide</i>,
Cl<sub>2</sub>O = 2HClO - H<sub>2</sub>O; and, in the second place, because, in a number
of instances, it evolves oxygen with great facility, forming hydrochloric
acid: HClO = HCl + O. Both hypochlorous acid and chlorine
monoxide may be regarded as products of the metalepsis of water,
because HOH corresponds with ClOH and ClOCl. Hence in many
instances bleaching salts (a mixture of hypochlorites and chlorides)
break up, with the evolution of (1) <i>chlorine</i>, under the action of an
excess of a powerful acid capable of evolving hydrochloric acid from
sodium or calcium chlorides, and this takes place most simply under
the action of hydrochloric acid itself, because (p. <a href="#Page_462">462</a>) NaCl + NaClO
+ 3HCl = 2NaCl + HCl + Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O; (2) <i>oxygen</i>, as we saw in
Chapter <a href="#Page_152">III</a>.&mdash;The bleaching properties and, in general, <i>oxidising action</i>
of bleaching salts is based on this evolution of oxygen (or chlorine);
oxygen is also disengaged on heating the dry salts&mdash;for instance,
NaCl + NaClO = 2NaCl + O; (3) and, lastly, <i>chlorine monoxide</i>,
which contains both chlorine and oxygen. Thus, if a little sulphuric,
nitric, or similar acid (not enough to liberate hydrochloric acid
from the CaCl<sub>2</sub>) be added to a solution of a bleaching salt (which
has an alkaline reaction, owing either to an excess of alkali or
to the feeble acid properties of HClO), then the hypochlorous acid set
free gives water and chlorine monoxide. If carbonic anhydride (or
boracic or a similar very feeble acid) act on the solution of a bleaching
salt, then hydrochloric acid is not evolved from the sodium or calcium
chlorides, but the hypochlorous acid is displaced and gives chlorine
monoxide,<a name="FNanchor_31_653" id="FNanchor_31_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_653" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> because hypochlorous acid is one of the most feeble acids.
Another method for the preparation of chlorine monoxide is based
on these feeble acid properties of hypochlorous acid. Zinc oxide and
mercury oxide, under the action of chlorine in the presence of water,
do not give a salt of hypochlorous acid, but form a chloride and
hypochlorous acid, which fact shows the incapacity of this acid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
combine with the bases mentioned. Therefore, if such oxides as those of
zinc or mercury be shaken up in water, and chlorine be passed through
the turbid liquid,<a name="FNanchor_32_654" id="FNanchor_32_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_654" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> a reaction occurs which may be expressed in the
following manner: 2HgO + 2Cl<sub>2</sub> = Hg<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>O. In this case, a
compound of mercury oxide with mercury chloride, or the so-called
mercury oxychloride, is obtained: Hg<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>2</sub> = HgO + HgCl<sub>2</sub>. This is
insoluble in water, and is not affected by hypochlorous anhydride, so
that the solution will contain hypochlorous acid only, but the greater
part of it splits up into the anhydride and water.<a name="FNanchor_32_BIS_655" id="FNanchor_32_BIS_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_BIS_655" class="fnanchor">[32 bis]</a></p>

<p>Chlorine monoxide, which corresponds to bleaching and hypochlorous
salts, containing as it does the two elements oxygen and
chlorine, forms a characteristic example of a compound of elements
which, in the majority of cases, act chemically in an analogous manner.
Chlorine monoxide, as prepared from an aqueous solution by the
abstraction of water or by the action of dry chlorine on cold mercury
oxide, is, at the ordinary temperature, a gas or vapour which condenses
into a red liquid boiling at +20° and giving a vapour whose
density (43 referred to hydrogen) shows that 2 vols. of chlorine and
1 vol. of oxygen give 2 vols. of chlorine monoxide. In an anhydrous
form the gas or liquid easily explodes, splitting up into chlorine and
oxygen. This explosiveness is determined by the fact that heat is
<i>evolved</i> in the decomposition to the amount of about 15,000 heat units
for Cl<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_33_656" id="FNanchor_33_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_656" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The explosion may even take place spontaneously, and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
in the presence of many oxidisable substances (for instance, sulphur,
organic compounds, &amp;c.), but the solution, although unstable and
showing a strong oxidising tendency, does not explode.<a name="FNanchor_34_657" id="FNanchor_34_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_657" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It is evident
that the presence of hypochlorous acid, HClO, may be assumed in an
aqueous solution of Cl<sub>2</sub>O, since Cl<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2HClO.</p>

<p>Hypochlorous acid, its salts, and chlorine monoxide serve as a
transition between hydrochloric acid, chlorides, and chlorine, and a
whole series of compounds containing the same elements combined
with a still greater quantity of oxygen. The higher oxides of chlorine,
as their origin indicates, are closely connected with hypochlorous acid
and its salts:</p>

<p>Part of the salt&mdash;namely, two-thirds of it&mdash;parts with its oxygen in
order to oxidise the remaining third.<a name="FNanchor_36_659" id="FNanchor_36_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_659" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> From an intermediate substance,
RX, two extremes, R and RX<sub>3</sub> are formed, just as nitrous
anhydride splits up into nitric oxide and nitric anhydride (or nitric
acid). The resulting salt, MClO<sub>3</sub>, corresponds with <i>chloric acid</i> and
potassium chlorate, KClO<sub>3</sub>. It is evident that a similar salt may be
obtained directly by the action of chlorine on an alkali if its solution
be heated, because RClO will be first formed, and then RClO<sub>3</sub>;
for example, 6KHO + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> = KClO<sub>3</sub> + 5KCl + 3H<sub>2</sub>O. Chlorates
are so prepared; for instance, <i>potassium chlorate</i>, which is easily
separated from potassium chloride, being sparingly soluble in cold
water.<a name="FNanchor_37_660" id="FNanchor_37_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_660" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>If dilute sulphuric acid be added to a solution of potassium chlorate,
<i>chloric acid</i> is liberated, but it cannot be separated by distillation,
as it is decomposed in the process. To obtain the free acid,
sulphuric acid must be added to a solution of barium chlorate.<a name="FNanchor_38_661" id="FNanchor_38_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_661" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The
sulphuric acid gives a precipitate of barium sulphate, and free chloric
acid remains in solution. The solution may be evaporated under
the receiver of an air-pump. This solution is colourless, has no
smell, and acts as a powerful acid (it neutralises sodium hydroxide,
decomposes sodium carbonate, gives hydrogen with zinc, &amp;c.); when
heated above 40°, however, it decomposes, forming chlorine, oxygen,
and perchloric acid: 4HClO<sub>3</sub> = 2HClO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub>. In a
concentrated condition the acid acts as an exceedingly energetic
oxidiser, so that organic substances brought into contact with it burst
into flame. Iodine, sulphurous acid, and similar oxidisable substances
form higher oxidation products and reduce the chloric acid to hydrochloric
acid. Hydrochloric acid gas gives chlorine with chloric acid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
(and consequently with KClO<sub>3</sub> also) acting in the same manner as it
acts on the lower acids: HClO<sub>3</sub> + 5HCl = 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 3Cl<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>By cautiously acting on potassium chlorate with sulphuric acid, the
<i>dioxide</i> (<i>chloric peroxide</i>), ClO<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_39_662" id="FNanchor_39_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_662" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> is obtained (Davy, Millon). This gas
is easily liquefied in a freezing mixture, and boils at +10°. The
vapour density (about 35 if H = 1) shows that the molecule of this
substance is ClO<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_40_663" id="FNanchor_40_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_663" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> In a gaseous or liquid state it very easily explodes
(for instance, at 60°, or by contact with organic compounds or finely
divided substances, &amp;c.), forming Cl and O<sub>2</sub>, and in many instances<a name="FNanchor_41_664" id="FNanchor_41_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_664" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
therefore it acts as an oxidising agent, although (like nitric peroxide)
it may itself be further oxidised.<a name="FNanchor_42_665" id="FNanchor_42_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_665" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> In dissolving in water or alkalis
chloric peroxide gives chlorous and hypochlorous acids&mdash;2ClO<sub>2</sub> + 2KHO
= KClO<sub>3</sub> + KClO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O&mdash;and therefore, like nitric peroxide,
the dioxide may be regarded as an intermediate oxide between the
(unknown) anhydrides of chlorous and chloric acids: 4ClO<sub>2</sub> = Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>
+ Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_43_666" id="FNanchor_43_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_666" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>As the salts of chloric acid, HClO<sub>3</sub>, are produced by the splitting
up of the salts of hypochlorous acid, so in the same way the salts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
perchloric acid, HClO<sub>4</sub>, are produced from the salts of chloric acid,
HClO<sub>3</sub>. But this is the highest form of the oxidation of HCl. <i>Perchloric
acid</i>, HClO<sub>4</sub>, is the most stable of all the acids of chlorine. When
fused potassium chlorate begins to swell up and solidify, after having
parted with one-third of its oxygen, potassium chloride and potassium
perchlorate have been formed according to the equation 2KClO<sub>3</sub>
= KClO<sub>4</sub> + KCl + O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The formation of this salt is easily observed in the preparation
of oxygen from potassium chlorate, owing to the fact that the potassium
perchlorate fuses with greater difficulty than the chlorate, and
therefore appears in the molten salt as solid grains (<i>see</i> Chapter III.
Note 12). Under the action of certain acids&mdash;for instance, sulphuric
and nitric&mdash;potassium chlorate also gives potassium perchlorate. This
latter may be easily purified, because it is but sparingly soluble in water,
although all the other salts of perchloric acid are very soluble and even
deliquesce in the air. The perchlorates, although they contain more
oxygen than the chlorates, are decomposed with greater difficulty, and
even when thrown on ignited charcoal give a much feebler deflagration
than the chlorates. Sulphuric acid (at a temperature not below 100°)
evolves volatile and to a certain extent stable perchloric acid from
potassium perchlorate. Neither sulphuric nor any other acid will
further decompose perchloric acid as it decomposes chloric acid. Of
all the acids of chlorine, perchloric acid alone can be distilled.<a name="FNanchor_44_667" id="FNanchor_44_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_667" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The
pure hydrate HClO<sub>4</sub><a name="FNanchor_45_668" id="FNanchor_45_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_668" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> is a colourless and exceedingly caustic substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
which fumes in the air and has a specific gravity 1·78 at 15° (sometimes,
after being kept for some time, it decomposes with a violent explosion).
It explodes violently when brought into contact with charcoal,
paper, wood, and other organic substances. If a small quantity of
water be added to this hydrate, and it be cooled, a crystallo-hydrate,
ClHO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, separates out. This is much more stable, but the liquid
hydrate HClO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O is still more so. The acid dissolves in water in
all proportions, and its solutions are distinguished for their stability.<a name="FNanchor_46_669" id="FNanchor_46_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_669" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
When ignited both the acid and its salts are decomposed, with the
evolution of oxygen.<a name="FNanchor_47_670" id="FNanchor_47_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_670" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p>On comparing chlorine as an element not only with nitrogen and
carbon but with all the other non-metallic elements (chlorine has so little
analogy with the metals that a comparison with them would be superfluous),
we find in it the following fundamental properties of <i>the halogens</i>
or salt-producers. With metals chlorine gives salts (such as sodium
chloride, &amp;c.); with hydrogen a very energetic and monobasic acid HCl,
and the same quantity of chlorine is able by metalepsis to replace the
hydrogen; with oxygen it forms unstable oxides of an acid character.
These properties of chlorine are possessed by three other elements,
bromine, iodine, and fluorine. They are members of one natural family.
Each representative has its peculiarities, its individual properties and
points of distinction, in combination and in the free state&mdash;otherwise they
would not be independent elements; but the repetition in all of them
of the same chief characteristics of the family enables one more quickly
to grasp all their various properties and to classify the elements themselves.</p>

<p>In order to have a guiding thread in forming comparisons between
the elements, attention must however be turned not only to their points
of resemblance but also to those of their properties and characters in
which they differ most from each other. And the atomic weights of
the elements must be considered as their most elementary property, since
this is a quantity which is most firmly established, and must be taken
account of in all the reactions of the element. The halogens have the
following atomic weights&mdash;</p>

<p class="title">F = 19,  Cl = 35·5,  Br = 80,  I = 127.</p>

<p>All the properties, physical and chemical, of the elements and their
corresponding compounds must evidently be in a certain dependence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
on this fundamental point, if the grouping in one family be natural.<a name="FNanchor_47_BIS_671" id="FNanchor_47_BIS_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_BIS_671" class="fnanchor">[47 bis]</a>
And we find in reality that, for instance, the properties of bromine,
whose atomic weight is almost the mean between those of iodine and
chlorine, occupy a mean position between those of these two elements.
The second measurable property of the elements is their equivalence or
their capacity for forming <i>compounds of definite forms</i>. Thus carbon
or nitrogen in this respect differs widely from the halogens. Although
the form ClO<sub>2</sub> corresponds with NO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, yet the last is the
highest oxide of carbon, whilst that of nitrogen is N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and for chlorine,
if there were an anhydride of perchloric acid, its composition would
be Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, which is quite different from that of carbon. In respect to
the forms of their compounds the halogens, like all elements of one
family or group, are perfectly analogous to each other, as is seen from
their hydrogen compounds:</p>

<p class="title">HF, HCl, HBr, HI.</p>

<p>Their oxygen compounds exhibit a similar analogy. Only fluorine
does not give any oxygen compounds. The iodine and bromine compounds
corresponding with HClO<sub>3</sub> and HClO<sub>4</sub> are HBrO<sub>3</sub> and HBrO<sub>4</sub>,
HIO<sub>3</sub> and HIO<sub>4</sub>. On comparing the properties of these acids we
can even predict that fluorine will not form any oxygen compound.
For iodine is easily oxidised&mdash;for instance, by nitric acid&mdash;whilst
chlorine is not directly oxidised. The oxygen acids of iodine are comparatively
more stable than those of chlorine; and, generally speaking,
the affinity of iodine for oxygen is much greater than that of chlorine.
Here also bromine occupies an intermediate position. In fluorine
we may therefore expect a still smaller affinity for oxygen than in
chlorine&mdash;and up to now it has not been combined with oxygen. If any
oxygen compounds of fluorine should be obtained, they will naturally be
exceedingly unstable. The relation of these elements to hydrogen is the
reverse of the above. Fluorine has so great an affinity for hydrogen
that it decomposes water at the ordinary temperature; whilst iodine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
has so little affinity for hydrogen that hydriodic acid, HI, is formed
with difficulty, is easily decomposed, and acts as a reducing agent in
a number of cases.</p>

<p>From the form of their compounds the halogens are <i>univalent
elements</i> with respect to hydrogen and septivalent with respect to
oxygen, N being trivalent to hydrogen (it gives NH<sub>3</sub>) and quinqui-valent
to oxygen (it gives N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), and C being quadrivalent to both H and O
as it forms CH<sub>4</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. And as not only their oxygen compounds,
but also their hydrogen compounds, have acid properties, the halogens
are <i>elements</i> of an exclusively <i>acid character</i>. Such metals as sodium,
potassium, barium only give basic oxides. In the case of nitrogen,
although it forms acid oxides, still in ammonia we find that capacity to
give an alkali with hydrogen which indicates a less distinctly acid
character than in the halogens. In no other elements is the acid-giving
property so strongly developed as in the halogens.</p>

<p>In describing certain peculiarities characterising the halogens, we
shall at every step encounter a confirmation of the above-mentioned
general relations.</p>

<p>As <i>fluorine</i> decomposes water with the evolution of oxygen,
F<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2HF + O, for a long time all efforts to obtain it in free
state by means of methods similar to those for the preparation of
chlorine proved fruitless.<a name="FNanchor_48_672" id="FNanchor_48_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_672" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Thus by the action of hydrofluoric acid
on manganese peroxide, or by decomposing a solution of hydrofluoric
acid by an electric current, either oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and
fluorine were obtained instead of fluorine. Probably a certain quantity
of fluorine<a name="FNanchor_48_BIS_673" id="FNanchor_48_BIS_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_BIS_673" class="fnanchor">[48 bis]</a> was set free by the action of oxygen or an electric
current on incandescent and fused calcium fluoride, but at a high
temperature fluorine acts even on platinum, and therefore it was not
obtained. When chlorine acted on silver fluoride, AgF, in a vessel of
natural fluor spar, CaF<sub>2</sub>, fluorine was also liberated; but it was mixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
with chlorine, and it was impossible to study the properties of the
resultant gas. Brauner (1881) also obtained fluorine by igniting cerium
fluoride, 2CeF<sub>4</sub> = 2CeF<sub>3</sub> + F<sub>2</sub>; but this, like all preceding efforts,
only showed fluorine to be a gas which decomposes water, and is
capable of acting in a number of instances like chlorine, but gave no
possibility of testing its properties. It was evident that it was
necessary to avoid as far as possible the presence of water and a rise of
temperature; this Moissan succeeded in doing in 1886. He decomposed
anhydrous hydrofluoric acid, liquefied at a temperature of -23°
and contained in a U-shaped tube (to which a small quantity of
potassium fluoride had been added to make it a better conductor), by
the action of a powerful electric current (twenty Bunsen's elements in
series). Hydrogen was then evolved at the negative pole, and fluorine
appeared at the positive pole (of iridium platinum) as a pale green gas
which decomposed water with the formation of ozone and hydrofluoric
acid, and combined directly with silicon (forming silicon fluoride, SiF<sub>4</sub>),
boron (forming BF<sub>3</sub>), sulphur, &amp;c. Its density (H = 1) is 18, so that
its molecule is F<sub>2</sub>. But the action of fluorine on metals at the ordinary
temperature is comparatively feeble, because the metallic fluoride
formed coats the remaining mass of the metals; it is, however, completely
absorbed by iron. Hydrocarbons (such as naphtha), alcohol,
&amp;c., immediately absorb fluorine, with the formation of hydrofluoric
acid. Fluorine when mixed with hydrogen can easily be made to
explode violently, forming hydrofluoric acid.<a name="FNanchor_49_674" id="FNanchor_49_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_674" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>In 1894, Brauner obtained fluorine directly by igniting the easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
formed<a name="FNanchor_49_BIS_675" id="FNanchor_49_BIS_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_BIS_675" class="fnanchor">[49 bis]</a> double lead salt HF,3KF,PbF<sub>4</sub>, which first, at 230°,
decomposes with the evolution of HF, and then splits up forming
3KF,PbF<sub>2</sub> and fluorine F<sub>2</sub>, which is recognised by the fact that it
liberates iodine from KI and easily combines with silicon, forming
SiF<sub>4</sub>. This method gives chemically pure fluorine, and is based upon
the breaking up of the higher compound&mdash;tetrafluoride of lead, PbF<sub>4</sub>,
corresponding to PbO<sub>2</sub>, into free fluorine, F<sub>2</sub>, and the lower more
stable form&mdash;bifluoride of lead, PbF<sub>2</sub>, which corresponds to PbO; that
is, this method resembles the ordinary method of obtaining chlorine
by means of MnO<sub>2</sub>, as MnCl<sub>4</sub> here breaks up into MnCl<sub>2</sub> and
chlorine, just as PbF<sub>4</sub> splits up into PbF<sub>2</sub> and fluorine.</p>

<p>Among the compounds of fluorine, calcium fluoride, CaF<sub>2</sub>, is somewhat
widely distributed in nature as fluor spar,<a name="FNanchor_50_676" id="FNanchor_50_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_676" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> whilst <i>cryolite</i>, or
aluminium sodium fluoride, Na<sub>3</sub>AlF<sub>6</sub>, is found more rarely (in large masses
in Greenland). Cryolite, like fluor spar, is also insoluble in water, and
gives hydrofluoric acid with sulphuric acid. Small quantities of fluorine
have also in a number of cases been found in the bodies of animals, in
the blood, urine, and bones. If fluorides occur in the bodies of animals,
they must have been introduced in food, and must occur in plants and in
water. And as a matter of fact river, and especially sea, water always
contains a certain, although small, quantity of fluorine compounds.</p>

<p>Hydrofluoric acid, HF, cannot be obtained from fluor spar in glass
retorts, because glass is acted on by and destroys the acid. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
prepared in lead vessels, and when it is required pure, in platinum
vessels, because lead also acts on hydrofluoric acid, although only very
feebly on the surface, and when once a coating of fluoride and sulphate
of lead is formed no further action takes place. Powdered fluor spar
and sulphuric acid evolve hydrofluoric acid (which fumes in the air)
even at the ordinary temperature, CaF<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = CaSO<sub>4</sub> + 2HF. At
130° fluor spar is completely decomposed by sulphuric acid. The acid is
then evolved as vapour, which may be condensed by a freezing mixture
into an anhydrous acid. The condensation is aided by pouring water
into the receiver of the condenser, as the acid is easily soluble in cold
water.</p>

<p>In the liquid anhydrous form hydrofluoric acid boils at +19°, and its
specific gravity at 12·8° = 0·9849.<a name="FNanchor_51_677" id="FNanchor_51_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_677" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> It dissolves in water with the evolution
of a considerable amount of heat, and gives a solution of constant
boiling point which distils over at 120°; showing that the acid is able to
combine with water. The specific gravity of the compound is 1·15, and
its composition HF,2H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_52_678" id="FNanchor_52_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_678" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> With an excess of water a dilute solution
distils over first. The aqueous solution and the acid itself must
be kept in platinum vessels, but the dilute acid may be conveniently
preserved in vessels made of various organic materials, such as gutta-percha,
or even in glass vessels having an interior coating of paraffin.
Hydrofluoric acid does not act on hydrocarbons and many other substances,
but it acts in a highly corrosive manner on metals, glass, porcelain,
and the majority of rock substances.<a name="FNanchor_53_679" id="FNanchor_53_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_679" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It also attacks the skin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
and is distinguished by its poisonous properties, so that in working with
the acid a strong draught must be kept up, to prevent the possibility of
the fumes being inhaled. The non-metals do not act on hydrofluoric
acid, but all metals&mdash;with the exception of mercury, silver, gold, and
platinum, and, to a certain degree, lead&mdash;decompose it with the evolution
of hydrogen. With bases it gives directly metallic fluorides, and
behaves in many respects like hydrochloric acid. There are, however,
several distinct individual differences, which are furthermore much
greater than those between hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydriodic
acids. Thus the silver compounds of the latter are insoluble in water,
whilst silver fluoride is soluble. Calcium fluoride, on the contrary, is
insoluble in water, whilst calcium chloride, bromide, and iodide are not
only soluble, but attract water with great energy. Neither hydrochloric,
hydrobromic, nor hydriodic acid acts on sand and glass, whilst
hydrofluoric acid corrodes them, forming gaseous silicon fluoride. The
other halogen acids only form normal salts, KCl, NaCl, with Na or K,
whilst hydrofluoric acid gives acid salts, for instance HKF<sub>2</sub> (and by
dissolving KF in liquid HF, KHF<sub>2</sub>2HF is obtained). This latter
property is in close connection with the fact that at the ordinary
temperature the vapour density of hydrofluoric acid is nearly 20, which
corresponds with a formula H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, as Mallet (1881) showed; but a
depolymerisation occurs with a rise of temperature, and the density
approaches 10, which answers to the formula HF.<a name="FNanchor_54_680" id="FNanchor_54_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_680" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The analogy between chlorine and the other two halogens, bromine
and iodine, is much more perfect. Not only have their hydrates or
halogen acids much in common, but they themselves resemble chlorine
in many respects,<a name="FNanchor_55_681" id="FNanchor_55_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_681" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and even the properties of the corresponding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
metallic compounds of bromine and iodine are very much alike. Thus,
the chlorides, bromides, and iodides of sodium and potassium crystallise
in the cubic system, and are soluble in water; the chlorides of calcium,
aluminium, magnesium, and barium are just as soluble in water as the
bromides and iodides of these metals. The iodides and bromides of
silver and lead are sparingly soluble in water, like the chlorides of
these metals. The oxygen compounds of bromine and iodine also
present a very strong analogy to the corresponding compounds of
chlorine. A hypobromous acid is known corresponding with hypochlorous
acid. The salts of this acid have the same bleaching property
as the salts of hypochlorous acid. Iodine was discovered in 1811 by
Courtois in kelp, and was shortly afterwards investigated by Clement,
Gay-Lussac, and Davy. Bromine was discovered in 1826 by Balard
in the mother liquor of sea water.</p>

<p><i>Bromine</i> and iodine, like chlorine, occur in sea water in combination
with metals. However, the amount of bromides, and especially
of iodides, in sea water is so small that their presence can only be
discovered by means of sensitive reactions.<a name="FNanchor_56_682" id="FNanchor_56_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_682" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In the extraction of salt
from sea water the bromides remain in the mother liquor. Iodine and
bromine also occur combined with silver, in admixture with silver
chloride, as a rare ore which is mainly found in America. Certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>
mineral waters (those of Kreuznach and Staro-rossüsk) contain metallic
bromides and iodides, always in admixture with an excess of sodium
chloride. Those upper strata of the Stassfurt rock salt (Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>.)
which are a source of potassium salts also contain metallic bromides,<a name="FNanchor_57_683" id="FNanchor_57_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_683" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
which collect in the mother liquors left after the crystallisation of the
potassium salts; and this now forms the chief source (together with
certain American springs) of the bromine in common use. Bromine
may be easily liberated from a mixture of bromides and chlorides,
owing to the fact that chlorine displaces bromine from its compounds
with sodium, magnesium, calcium, &amp;c. A colourless solution of
bromides and chlorides turns an orange colour after the passage of
chlorine, owing to the disengagement of bromine.<a name="FNanchor_58_684" id="FNanchor_58_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_684" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> Bromine may be
extracted on a large scale by a similar method, but it is simpler to add
a small quantity of manganese peroxide and sulphuric acid to the
mother liquid direct. This sets free a portion of the chlorine, and this
chlorine liberates the bromine.</p>

<p>Bromine is a <i>dark brown liquid</i>, giving brown fumes, and having a
poisonous suffocating smell, whence its name (from the Greek &#946;&#961;&#8182;&#956;&#959;&#962;,
signifying evil smelling). The vapour density of bromine shows that
its molecule is Br<sub>2</sub>. In the cold bromine freezes into brown-grey scales
like iodine. The melting point of pure bromine is -7°·05.<a name="FNanchor_59_685" id="FNanchor_59_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_685" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The
density of liquid bromide at 0° is 3·187, and at 15° about 3·0. The
boiling point of bromine is about 58°·7. Bromine, like chlorine, is
soluble in water; 1 part of bromine at 5° requires 27 parts of water,
and at 15° 29 parts of water. The aqueous solution of bromine is of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
an orange colour, and when cooled to -2° yields crystals containing
10 molecules of water to 1 molecule of bromine.<a name="FNanchor_60_686" id="FNanchor_60_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_686" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Alcohol dissolves a
greater quantity of bromine, and ether a still greater amount. But
after a certain time products of the action of the bromine on these
organic substances are formed in the solutions. Aqueous solutions of
the bromides also absorb a large amount of bromine.</p>

<p>With respect to <i>iodine</i>, it is almost exclusively extracted from the
mother liquors after the crystallisation of natural sodium nitrate (Chili
saltpetre) and from the ashes of the sea-weed cast upon the shores of
France, Great Britain, and Spain, sometimes in considerable quantities,
by the high tides. The majority of these sea-weeds are of the genera
<i>Fucus</i>, <i>Laminaria</i>, &amp;c. The fused ashes of these sea-weeds are called
&lsquo;kelp&rsquo; in Scotland and &lsquo;varech&rsquo; in Normandy. A somewhat considerable
quantity of iodine is contained in these sea-weeds. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span>
being burnt (or subjected to dry distillation) an ash is left which
chiefly contains salts of potassium, sodium, and calcium. The metals
occur in the sea-weed as salts of organic acids. On being burnt these
organic salts are decomposed, forming carbonates of potassium and
sodium. Hence, sodium carbonate is found in the ash of sea plants.
The ash is dissolved in hot water, and on evaporation sodium carbonate
and other salts separate, but a portion of the substances
remains in solution. These mother liquors left after the separation of
the sodium carbonate contain chlorine, bromine, and iodine in combination
with metals, the chlorine and iodine being in excess of the bromine.
13,000 kilos of kelp give about 1,000 kilos of sodium carbonate and
15 kilos of iodine.</p>

<p>The liberation of the iodine from the mother liquor is effected with
comparative ease, because chlorine disengages iodine from potassium
iodide and its other combinations with the metals. Not only chlorine,
but also sulphuric acid, liberates iodine from sodium iodide. Sulphuric
acid, in acting on an iodide, sets hydriodic acid free, but the latter
easily decomposes, especially in the presence of substances capable of
evolving oxygen, such as chromic acid, nitrous acid, and even ferric
salts.<a name="FNanchor_61_687" id="FNanchor_61_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_687" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Owing to its sparing solubility in water, the iodine liberated
separates as a precipitate. To obtain pure iodine it is sufficient to
distil it, and neglect the first and last portions of the distillate, the
middle portion only being collected. Iodine passes directly from a state
of vapour into a crystalline form, and settles on the cool portions of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[498]</a></span>
apparatus in tabular crystals, having a black grey colour and metallic
lustre.<a name="FNanchor_62_688" id="FNanchor_62_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_688" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>The specific gravity of the crystals of iodine is 4·95. It melts at
114° and boils at 184°. Its vapour is formed at a much lower temperature,
and is of a violet colour, whence iodine receives its name (&#7984;&#959;&#949;&#953;&#948;&#951;&#962;,
violet). The smell of iodine recalls the characteristic smell of hypochlorous
acid; it has a sharp sour taste. It destroys the skin and organs
of the body, and is therefore frequently employed for cauterising and as
an irritant for the skin. In small quantities it turns the skin brown,
but the coloration disappears after a certain time, partly owing to the
volatility of the iodine. Water dissolves only <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>5000</sub> part of iodine. A
brown solution is thus obtained, which bleaches, but much more feebly
than bromine and chlorine. Water which contains salts, and especially
iodides, in solution dissolves iodine in considerable quantities, and the
resultant solution is of a dark brown colour. Pure alcohol dissolves a
small amount of iodine, and in so doing acquires a brown colour, but
the solubility of iodine is considerably increased by the presence of a
small quantity of an iodine compound&mdash;for instance, ethyl iodide&mdash;in
the alcohol.<a name="FNanchor_63_689" id="FNanchor_63_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_689" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Ether dissolves a larger amount of iodine than alcohol;
but iodine is particularly soluble in liquid hydrocarbons, in carbon bisulphide,
and in chloroform. A small quantity of iodine dissolved
in carbon bisulphide tints it rose-colour, but in a somewhat larger
amount it gives a violet colour. Chloroform (quite free from alcohol)
is also tinted rose colour by a small amount of iodine. This gives an
easy means for detecting the presence of free iodine in small quantities.
The blue coloration which free iodine gives with <i>starch</i> may also,
as has already been frequently mentioned (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>.), serve for
the detection of iodine.</p>

<p>If we compare the four elements, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and
iodine, we see in them an example of analogous substances which
arrange themselves by their physical properties in the same order as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[499]</a></span>
they stand in respect to their atomic and molecular weights. If the
weight of the molecule be large, the substance has a higher specific
gravity, a higher melting and boiling point, and a whole series of properties
depending on this difference in its fundamental properties.
Chlorine in a free state boils at about -35°, bromine boils at 60°, and
iodine only above 180°. According to Avogadro-Gerhardt's law, the
vapour densities of these elements in a gaseous state are proportional
to their atomic weights, and here, at all events approximately, the
densities in a liquid (or solid) state are also almost in the ratio of their
atomic weights. Dividing the atomic weight of chlorine (35·5) by its
specific gravity in a liquid state (1·3), we obtain a volume = 27, for
bromine (80/3·1) 26, and for iodine also (127/4·9) 26.<a name="FNanchor_64_690" id="FNanchor_64_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_690" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The metallic bromides and iodides are in the majority of cases, in most
respects analogous to the corresponding chlorides,<a name="FNanchor_65_691" id="FNanchor_65_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_691" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> but chlorine displaces
the bromine and iodine from them, and bromine liberates iodine from
iodides, which is taken advantage of in the preparation of these halogens.
However, the researches of Potilitzin showed that a <i>reverse</i> displacement
of chlorine by bromine may occur both in solutions and in
ignited metallic chlorides in an atmosphere of bromine vapour&mdash;that is,
a distribution of the metal (according to Berthollet's doctrine) takes
place between the halogens, although however the larger portion, still
unites with the chlorine, which shows its greater affinity for metals as
compared with that of bromine and iodine.<a name="FNanchor_66_692" id="FNanchor_66_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_692" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> The latter, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
sometimes behave with respect to metallic oxides in exactly the same
manner as chlorine. Gay-Lussac, by igniting potassium carbonate in
iodine vapour, obtained (as with chlorine) an evolution of oxygen and
carbonic anhydride, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> = 2KI + CO<sub>2</sub> + O, only the reactions
between the halogens and oxygen are more easily reversible with
bromine and iodine than with chlorine. Thus, at a red heat oxygen
displaces iodine from barium iodide. Aluminium iodide burns in
a current of oxygen (Deville and Troost), and a similar, although
not so clearly marked, relation exists for aluminium chloride, and shows
that the halogens have a distinctly smaller affinity for those metals
which only form feeble bases. This is still more the case with
the non-metals, which form acids and evolve much more heat with
oxygen than with the halogens (Note <a href="#Footnote_13_634">13</a>). But in all these instances
the affinity (and amount of heat evolved) of iodine and bromine is less
than that of chlorine, probably because the atomic weights are greater.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[501]</a></span>
The smaller store of energy in iodine and bromine is seen still more
clearly in the relation of the halogens to hydrogen. In a gaseous state
they all enter, with more or less ease, into direct combination with
gaseous hydrogen&mdash;for example, in the presence of spongy platinum,
forming halogen acids, HX&mdash;but the latter are far from being equally
stable; hydrogen chloride is the most stable, hydrogen iodide the least
so, and hydrogen bromide occupies an intermediate position. A very
high temperature is required to decompose hydrogen chloride even partially,
whilst hydrogen iodide is decomposed by light even at the
ordinary temperature and very easily by a red heat. Hence the reaction
I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> = HI + HI is very easily reversible, and consequently has a
limit, and hydrogen iodide easily dissociates.<a name="FNanchor_67_693" id="FNanchor_67_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_693" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Judging by the direct
measurement of the heat evolved (22,000 heat units) in the formation
of HCl, the conversion of 2HCl into H<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> requires the expenditure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[502]</a></span>
of 44,000 heat units. The decomposition of 2HBr into H<sub>2</sub> + Br<sub>2</sub>
only requires, if the bromine be obtained in a gaseous state, a consumption
of about 24,000 units, whilst in the decomposition of 2HI
into H<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> as vapour about 3,000 heat units are <i>evolved</i>;<a name="FNanchor_68_694" id="FNanchor_68_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_694" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
these facts, without doubt, stand in causal connection with the great
stability of hydrogen chloride, the easy decomposability of hydrogen
iodide, and the intermediate properties of hydrogen bromide. From
this it would be expected that chlorine is capable of decomposing water
with the evolution of oxygen, whilst iodine has not the energy to
produce this disengagement,<a name="FNanchor_69_695" id="FNanchor_69_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_695" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> although it is able to liberate the oxygen
from the oxides of potassium and sodium, the affinity of these metals for
the halogens being very considerable. For this reason oxygen, especially
in compounds from which it can be evolved readily (for instance, ClHO,
CrO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c.), easily decomposes hydrogen iodide. A mixture of hydrogen
iodide and oxygen burns in the presence of an ignited substance, forming
water and iodine. Drops of nitric acid in an atmosphere of hydrogen
iodide cause the disengagement of violet fumes of iodine and brown
fumes of nitric peroxide. In the presence of alkalis and an excess of
water, however, iodine is able to effect oxidation like chlorine&mdash;that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[503]</a></span>
it decomposes water; the action is here aided by the affinity of hydrogen
iodide for the alkali and water, just as sulphuric acid helps zinc to decompose
water. But the relative instability of hydriodic acid is best seen in
comparing the acids in a gaseous state. If the halogen acids be dissolved
in water, they evolve so much heat that they approach much nearer
to each other in properties. This is seen from thermochemical data,
for in the formation of HX in solution (in a large excess of water)
from the <i>gaseous</i> elements there is <i>evolved</i> for HCl 39,000, for HBr 32,000,
and for HI 18,000 heat units.<a name="FNanchor_70_696" id="FNanchor_70_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_696" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> But it is especially evident from
the fact that solutions of hydrogen bromide and iodide in water have
many points in common with solutions of hydrogen chloride, both in
their capacity to form hydrates and fuming solutions of constant boiling
point, and in their capacity to form haloid salts, &amp;c. by reacting on
bases.</p>

<p>In consequence of what has been said above, it follows that <i>hydrobromic
and hydriodic acids</i>, being substances which are but slightly
stable, cannot be evolved in a gaseous state under many of those conditions
under which hydrochloric acid is formed. Thus if sulphuric acid
in solution acts on sodium iodide, all the same phenomena take place
as with sodium chloride (a portion of the sodium iodide gives hydriodic
acid, and all remains in solution), but if sodium iodide be mixed
with strong sulphuric acid, then the oxygen of the latter decomposes
the hydriodic acid set free, with liberation of iodine, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2HI
= 2H<sub>2</sub>O + SO<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>. This reaction takes place in the reverse direction
in the presence of a <i>large quantity</i> of water (2,000 parts of water per
1 part of SO<sub>2</sub>), in which case not only the affinity of hydriodic acid for
water is brought to light but also the action of water in directing chemical
reactions in which it participates.<a name="FNanchor_71_697" id="FNanchor_71_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_697" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> Therefore, with a halogen salt,
it is easy to obtain gaseous hydrochloric acid by the action of sulphuric
acid, but neither hydrobromic nor hydriodic acid can be so obtained in
the free state (as gases).<a name="FNanchor_72_698" id="FNanchor_72_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_698" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Other methods have to be resorted to for their
preparation, and recourse must not be had to compounds of oxygen, which
are so easily able to destroy these acids. Therefore hydrogen sulphide,
phosphorus, &amp;c., which themselves easily take up oxygen, are introduced
as means for the conversion of bromine and iodine into hydrobromic and
hydriodic acids in the presence of water. For example, in the action of
phosphorus the essence of the matter is that the oxygen of the water goes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[504]</a></span>
to the phosphorus, and the union of the remaining elements leads to the
formation of hydrobromic or hydriodic acid; but the matter is complicated
by the reversibility of the reaction, the affinity for water, and other
circumstances which are understood by following Berthollet's doctrine.
Chlorine (and bromine also) directly decomposes hydrogen sulphide,
forming hydrochloric acid and liberating sulphur, both in a gaseous form
and in solutions, whilst iodine only decomposes hydrogen sulphide in
weak solutions, when its affinity for hydrogen is aided by the affinity of
hydrogen iodide for water. In a gaseous state iodine does not act
on hydrogen sulphide,<a name="FNanchor_73_699" id="FNanchor_73_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_699" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> whilst sulphur is able to decompose gaseous
hydriodic acid, forming hydrogen sulphide and a compound of sulphur
and iodine which with water forms hydriodic acid.<a name="FNanchor_74_700" id="FNanchor_74_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_700" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>If hydrogen sulphide be passed through water containing iodine, the
reaction H<sub>2</sub>S + I<sub>2</sub> = 2HI + S proceeds so long as the solution is
dilute, but when the mass of free HI increases the reaction stops,
because the iodine then passes into solution. A solution having a
composition approximating to 2HI + 4I<sub>2</sub> + 9H<sub>2</sub>O (according to
Bineau) does not react with H<sub>2</sub>S, notwithstanding the quantity of free
iodine. Therefore only weak solutions of hydriodic acid can be
obtained by passing hydrogen sulphide into water with iodine.<a name="FNanchor_74_BIS_701" id="FNanchor_74_BIS_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_BIS_701" class="fnanchor">[74 bis]</a></p>

<p>To obtain<a name="FNanchor_75_702" id="FNanchor_75_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_702" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> gaseous hydrobromic and hydriodic acids it is most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[505]</a></span>
convenient to take advantage of the reactions between phosphorus,
the halogens, and water, the latter being present in small quantity
(otherwise the halogen acids formed are dissolved by it); the
halogen is gradually added to the phosphorus moistened with water.
Thus if red phosphorus be placed in a flask and moistened with
water, and bromine be added drop by drop (from a tap funnel), hydrobromic
acid is abundantly and uniformly disengaged.<a name="FNanchor_76_703" id="FNanchor_76_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_703" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Hydrogen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[506]</a></span>
iodide is prepared by adding 1 part of common (yellow) dry phosphorus
to 10 parts of dry iodine in a glass flask. On shaking the flask,
union proceeds quietly between them (light and heat being evolved),
and when the mass of iodide of phosphorus which is formed has
cooled, water is added drop by drop (from a tap funnel) and hydrogen
iodide is evolved directly without the aid of heat. These methods of
preparation will be at once understood when it is remembered (p. <a href="#Page_468">468</a>)
that phosphorus chloride gives hydrogen chloride with water. It is
exactly the same here&mdash;the oxygen of the water passes over to the
phosphorus, and the hydrogen to the iodine, thus, PI<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O
= PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 3HI.<a name="FNanchor_77_704" id="FNanchor_77_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_704" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>In a gaseous form hydrobromic and hydriodic acids are closely
analogous to hydrochloric acid; they are liquefied by pressure and cold,
they fume in the air, form solutions and hydrates, of constant boiling
point, and react on metals, oxides and salts, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_78_705" id="FNanchor_78_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_705" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Only the relatively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[507]</a></span>
easy decomposability of hydrobromic acid and especially of hydriodic
acid, clearly distinguish these acids from hydrochloric acid. For this
reason, hydriodic acid acts in a number of cases as a deoxidiser or
reducer, and frequently even serves as a means for the transference of
hydrogen. Thus Berthelot, Baeyer, Wreden, and others, by heating
unsaturated hydrocarbons in a solution of hydriodic acid, obtained their
compounds with hydrogen nearer to the limit C<sub><i>n</i></sub>H<sub>2<i>n</i>+2</sub> or even the
saturated compounds. For example, benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, when heated in a
closed tube with a strong solution of hydriodic acid, gives hexylene,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>. The easy decomposability of hydriodic acid accounts for the
fact that iodine does not act by metalepsis on hydrocarbons, for the
hydrogen iodide liberated with the product of metalepsis, RI, formed,
gives iodine and the hydrogen compound, RH, back again. And therefore,
to obtain the products of iodine substitution, either iodic acid, HIO<sub>3</sub>
(Kekulé), or mercury oxide, HgO (Weselsky), is added, as they immediately
react on the hydrogen iodide, thus: HIO<sub>3</sub> + 5HI = 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 3I<sub>2</sub>,
or, HgO + 2HI = HgI<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. From these considerations it will
be readily understood that iodine acts like chlorine (or bromine)
on ammonia and sodium hydroxide, for in these cases the hydriodic
acid produced forms NH<sub>4</sub>I and NaI. With tincture of iodine
or even the solid element, a solution of ammonia immediately forms
a highly-explosive solid black product of metalepsis, NHI<sub>2</sub>, generally
known as <i>iodide</i> of <i>nitrogen</i>, although it still contains hydrogen
(this was proved beyond doubt by Szuhay 1893), which may be
replaced by silver (with the formation of NAgI<sub>2</sub>): 3NH<sub>3</sub> + 2I<sub>2</sub>
= 2NH<sub>4</sub>I + NHI<sub>2</sub>. However, the composition of the last product is
variable, and with an excess of water NI<sub>3</sub> seems to be formed. Iodide
of nitrogen is just as explosive as nitrogen chloride.<a name="FNanchor_78_BIS_706" id="FNanchor_78_BIS_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_BIS_706" class="fnanchor">[78 bis]</a> In the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[508]</a></span>
action of iodine on sodium hydroxide no bleaching compound is formed
(whilst bromine gives one), but a direct reaction is always accomplished
with the formation of an iodate, 6NaHO + 3I<sub>2</sub> = 5NaI + 3H<sub>2</sub>O + NaIO<sub>3</sub>
(Gay-Lussac). Solutions of other alkalis, and even a mixture of water
and oxide of mercury, act in the same manner.<a name="FNanchor_79_707" id="FNanchor_79_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_707" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> This direct formation
of <i>iodic acid</i>, HIO<sub>3</sub> = IO<sub>2</sub>(OH), shows the propensity of iodine to give
compounds of the type IX<sub>5</sub>. Indeed, this capacity of iodine to form
compounds of a high type emphasises itself in many ways. But it is
most important to turn attention to the fact that iodic acid is easily
and directly formed by the action of oxidising substances on iodine.
Thus, for instance, strong nitric acid directly converts iodine into
iodic acid, whilst it has no oxidising action on chlorine.<a name="FNanchor_79_BIS_708" id="FNanchor_79_BIS_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_BIS_708" class="fnanchor">[79 bis]</a> This
shows a greater affinity in iodine for oxygen than in chlorine, and this
conclusion is confirmed by the fact that iodine displaces chlorine from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[509]</a></span>
its oxygen acids,<a name="FNanchor_80_709" id="FNanchor_80_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_709" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> and that in the presence of water chlorine oxidises
iodine.<a name="FNanchor_81_710" id="FNanchor_81_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_710" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Even ozone or a silent discharge passed through a mixture of

acid. It is disengaged from solutions as a hydrate, HIO<sub>3</sub>, which loses
water at 170°, and gives an anhydride, I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>. Both these substances
are crystalline (sp. gr. I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> 5·037, HIO<sub>3</sub> 4·869 at 0°), colourless and

<p>As with chlorine, so with iodine, a <i>periodic acid</i>, HIO<sub>4</sub>, is formed.
This acid is produced in the form of its salts, by the action of chlorine
on alkaline solutions of iodates, and also by the action of iodine on
chloric acid.<a name="FNanchor_84_714" id="FNanchor_84_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_714" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> It crystallises from solutions as a hydrate containing
2H<sub>2</sub>O (corresponding with HClO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O), but as it forms salts containing
up to 5 atoms of metals, this water must be counted as water
of constitution. Therefore IO(OH)<sub>5</sub> = HIO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O corresponds with
the highest form of halogen compounds, IX<sub>7</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_85_715" id="FNanchor_85_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_715" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> In decomposing (at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[511]</a></span>

may also be ultimately decomposed.</p>

<p>Compounds formed between chlorine and iodine must be classed
among the most interesting halogen bodies.<a name="FNanchor_86_716" id="FNanchor_86_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_716" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> These elements combine
together directly with evolution of heat, and form <i>iodine
monochloride</i>, ICl, or <i>iodine trichloride</i>, ICl<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_87_717" id="FNanchor_87_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_717" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> As water reacts on
these substances, forming iodic acid and iodine, they have to be prepared
from dry iodine and chlorine.<a name="FNanchor_88_718" id="FNanchor_88_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_718" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Both substances are formed in a
number of reactions; for example, by the action of aqua regia on iodine,
of chlorine on hydriodic acid, of hydrochloric acid on periodic acid, of
iodine on potassium chlorate (with the aid of heat, &amp;c.) Trapp obtained
iodine monochloride, in beautiful red crystals, by passing a rapid
current of chlorine into molten iodine. The monochloride then distils
over and solidifies, melting at 27°. By passing chlorine over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[512]</a></span>
crystals of the monochloride, it is easy to obtain iodine trichloride in
orange crystals, which melt at 34° and volatilise at 47°, but in so doing
decompose (into Cl<sub>2</sub> and ClI). The chemical properties of these
chlorides entirely resemble those of chlorine and iodine, as would be
expected, because, in this instance, a combination of similar substances
has taken place as in the formation of solutions or alloys. Thus, for
instance, the unsaturated hydrocarbons (for example, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>), which
are capable of directly combining with chlorine and iodine, also directly
combine with iodine monochloride.</p>

the formation of acids by the combination of water with the oxides of the non-metals,
and therefore there was reason for thinking that hydrochloric acid was formed by the
combination of water with the oxide of some element. Hence when Scheele obtained
chlorine by the action of hydrochloric acid on manganese peroxide he considered it as
the acid contained in common salt. When it became known that chlorine gives hydrochloric
acid with hydrogen, Lavoisier and Berthollet supposed it to be a compound with
oxygen of an anhydride contained in hydrochloric acid. They supposed that hydrochloric
acid contained water and the oxide of a particular radicle, and that chlorine was
a higher degree of oxidation of this radicle <i>muvias</i> (from the Latin neme of hydrochloric
acid, <i>acidum muriaticum</i>). It was only in 1811 that Gay-Lussac and Thénard in
France and Davy in England arrived at the conclusion that the substance obtained by
Scheele does not contain oxygen, nor under any conditions give water with hydrogen,
and that there is no water in hydrochloric acid gas, and therefore concluded that chlorine
is an elementary substance. They named it &lsquo;chlorine&rsquo; from the Greek word &#967;&#955;&#969;&#961;&#8057;&#962;,
signifying a green colour, because of the peculiar colour by which this gas is characterised</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_BIS_624" id="Footnote_3_BIS_624"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_BIS_624"><span class="label">[3 bis]</span></a> This representation of the process of the reaction is most natural. However,
this decomposition is generally represented as if chlorine gave only one degree of combination
with manganese, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, and therefore directly reacts in the following manner&mdash;MnO<sub>2</sub>
+ 4HCl = MnCl<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub>, in which case it is supposed that manganese
peroxide, MnO<sub>2</sub>, breaks up, as it were, into manganous oxide, MnO and oxygen, both of
which react with hydrochloric acid, the manganous oxide acting upon HCl as a base,
giving MnCl<sub>2</sub> and at the same time 2HCl + O = H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub>. In reality, a mixture of oxygen
and hydrochloric acid does give chlorine at a red heat, and this reaction may also take
place at the moment of its evolution in this case.</p>

<p>All the oxides of manganese (Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, MnO<sub>2</sub>, MnO<sub>3</sub>, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>), with the exception of manganous
oxide, MnO, disengage chlorine from hydrochloric acid, because manganous
chloride, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, is the only compound of chlorine and manganese which exists as a stable
compound, all the higher chlorides of manganese being unstable and evolving chlorine.
Hence we here take note of two separate changes: (1) an exchange between oxygen and
chlorine, and (2) the instability of the higher chlorine compounds. As (according to the
law of substitution) in the substitution of oxygen by chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub> takes the place of O,
the chlorine compounds will contain more atoms than the corresponding oxygen
compounds. It is not surprising, therefore, that certain of the chlorine compounds
corresponding with oxygen compounds do not exist, or if they are formed are
very unstable. And furthermore, an atom of chlorine is heavier than an atom of oxygen,
and therefore a given element would have to retain a large mass of chlorine if in the
higher oxides the oxygen were replaced by chlorine. For this reason equivalent compounds
of chlorine do not exist for all oxygen compounds. Many of the former are
immediately decomposed, when formed, with the evolution of chlorine. From this it is
evident that there should exist such chlorine compounds as would evolve chlorine as
peroxides evolve oxygen, and indeed a large number of such compounds are known.
Amongst them may be mentioned antimony pentachloride, SbCl<sub>5</sub>, which splits up into
chlorine and antimony trichloride when heated. Cupric chloride, corresponding with
copper oxide, and having a composition CuCl<sub>2</sub>, similar to CuO, when heated parts with
half its chlorine, just as barium peroxide evolves half its oxygen. This method may
even be taken advantage of for the preparation of chlorine and cuprous chloride, CuCl.
The latter attracts oxygen from the atmosphere, and in so doing is converted from a
colourless substance into a green compound whose composition is Cu<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>O. With
hydrochloric acid this substance gives cupric chloride (Cu<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>O + 2HCl = H<sub>2</sub>O + 2CuCl<sub>2</sub>),
which has only to be dried and heated in order again to obtain chlorine. Thus, in solution,
and at the ordinary temperature, the compound CuCl<sub>2</sub> is stable, but when heated it
splits up. On this property is founded Deacon's process for the preparation of chlorine
from hydrochloric acid with the aid of air and copper salts, by passing a mixture of air and
hydrochloric acid at about 440° over bricks saturated with a solution of a copper salt
(a mixture of solutions of CuSO<sub>4</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). CuCl<sub>2</sub> is then formed by the double
decomposition of the salt of copper and the hydrochloric acid; the CuCl<sub>2</sub> liberates
chlorine, and the CuCl forms Cu<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>O with the oxygen of the air, which again gives CuCl<sub>2</sub>
with 2HCl, and so on.</p>

<p>Magnesium chloride, which is obtained from sea-water, carnallite, &amp;c., may serve not
only as a means for the preparation of hydrochloric acid, but also of chlorine, because
its basic salt (magnesium oxychloride) when heated in the air gives magnesium oxide and
chlorine (Weldon-Pechiney's process, 1888). Chlorine is now prepared on a large scale
by this method. Several new methods based upon this reaction have been proposed for
procuring chlorine from the bye-products of other chemical processes. Thus, Lyte and
Tattars (1891) obtained up to 67 p.c. of chlorine from CaCl<sub>2</sub> in this manner. A solution
of CaCl<sub>2</sub>, containing a certain amount of common salt, is evaporated and oxide of
magnesium added to it. When the solution attains a density of 1·2445 (at 15°), it is
treated with carbonic acid, which precipitates carbonate of calcium, while chloride of
magnesium remains in solution. After adding ammonium chloride, the solution is
evaporated to dryness and the double chloride of magnesium and ammonium formed is
ignited, which drives off the chloride of ammonium. The chloride of magnesium which
remains behind is used in the Weldon-Pechiney process. The De Wilde-Reychler (1892)
process for the manufacture of chlorine consists in passing alternate currents of hot air
and hydrochloric acid gas through a cylinder containing a mixture of the chlorides of
magnesium and manganese. A certain amount of sulphate of magnesium which does
not participate in any way in the reaction, is added to the mixture to prevent its fusing.
The reactions may be expressed by the following equations: (1) 3MgCl<sub>2</sub> + 3MnCl<sub>2</sub> + 8O
= Mg<sub>3</sub>Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> + 12Cl; (2) Mg<sub>3</sub>Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> + 16HCl = 3MgCl<sub>2</sub> + 3MnCl<sub>2</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O + 4Cl. As nitric
acid is able to take up the hydrogen from hydrochloric acid, a heated mixture of these
acids is also employed for the preparation of chlorine. The resultant mixture of chlorine
and lower oxides of nitrogen is mixed with air and steam which regenerates the HNO<sub>3</sub>,
while the chlorine remains as a gas together with nitrogen, in which form it is quite
capable of bleaching, forming chloride of lime, &amp;c. Besides these, Solvay and Mond's
methods of preparing chlorine must be mentioned. The first is based upon the reaction
CaCl<sub>2</sub> + SiO<sub>2</sub> + O(air) = CaOSiO<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>, the second on the action of the oxygen of the air
(heated) upon MgCl<sub>2</sub> (and certain similar chlorides) MgCl<sub>2</sub> + O = MgO + Cl<sub>2</sub> The remaining
MgO is treated with sal-ammoniac to re-form MgCl<sub>2</sub> (MgO + 2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl = MgCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + 2NH<sub>3</sub>)
and the resultant NH<sub>3</sub> again converted into sal-ammoniac, so that hydrochloric acid
is the only substance consumed. The latter processes have not yet found much application.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_625" id="Footnote_4_625"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_625"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The following proportions are accordingly taken by weight: 5 parts of powdered manganese
peroxide, 11 parts of salt (best fused, to prevent its frothing), and 14 parts of sulphuric

salt bath, so as to obtain a temperature above 100°. The corks in the apparatus must
be soaked in paraffin (otherwise they are corroded by the chlorine), and black india-rubber
tubing smeared with vaseline must be used, and not vulcanised rubber (which contains
sulphur, and becomes brittle under the action of the chlorine).</p>

preparation of chlorine. This reaction is very violent if all the acid be added at once;
it should be poured in drop by drop (Mermé, Kämmerer). C. Winkler proposed to mix
bleaching powder with one quarter of burnt and powdered gypsum, and having damped
the mixture with water, to press and cut it up into cubes and dry at the ordinary
temperature. These cubes can be used for the preparation of chlorine in the same
apparatus as that used for the evolution of hydrogen and carbonic anhydride&mdash;the

<p class="caption" style="width: 150px"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 66.&mdash;Clay retort for
the preparation of
chlorine on a large
scale.</p></div>

<p>Chlorine is manufactured on a <i>large scale</i> from manganese peroxide and hydrochloric
acid. It is most conveniently prepared in the apparatus shown in fig. <a href="#fig_66">66</a>, which consists
of a three-necked earthenware vessel whose central orifice is the largest. A clay
or lead funnel, furnished with a number of orifices, is placed in the central wide neck
of the vessel. Roughly-ground lumps of natural manganese peroxide are placed in the
funnel, which is then closed by the cover N, and luted with clay. One orifice is closed
by a clay stopper, and is used for the introduction of the hydrochloric acid and
withdrawal of the residues. The chlorine disengaged passes along a leaden gas-conducting
tube placed in the other orifice. A row of these
vessels is surrounded by a water-bath to ensure their being
uniformly heated. Manganese chloride is found in the residue.
In Weldon's process lime is added to the acid solution of manganese
chloride. A double decomposition takes place, resulting
in the formation of manganous hydroxide and calcium chloride.
When the insoluble manganous hydroxide has settled, a further
excess of milk of lime is added (to make a mixture
2Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub> + CaO + <i>x</i>CaCl<sub>2</sub>, which is found to be the best proportion,
judging from experiment), and then air is forced through
the mixture. The hydroxide is thus converted from a colourless
to a brown substance, containing peroxide, MnO<sub>2</sub>, and oxide of
manganese, Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. This is due to the manganous oxide absorbing
oxygen from the air. Under the action of hydrochloric acid this mixture evolves
chlorine, because of all the compounds of chlorine and manganese the chloride MnCl<sub>2</sub>
is the only one which is stable (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_3_623">3</a>). Thus one and the same mass of manganese
may be repeatedly used for the preparation of chlorine. The same result is attained in
other ways. If manganous oxide be subjected to the action of oxides of nitrogen and air
(Coleman's process), then manganese nitrate is formed, which at a red heat gives oxides
of nitrogen (which are again used in the process) and manganese peroxide, which is thus
renewed for the fresh evolution of chlorine.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_628" id="Footnote_7_628"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_628"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Davy and Faraday liquefied chlorine in 1823 by heating the crystallo-hydrate
Cl<sub>2</sub>8H<sub>2</sub>O in a bent tube (as with NH<sub>3</sub>), surrounded by warm water, while the other end of
the tube was immersed in a freezing mixture. Meselan condensed chlorine in freshly-burnt
charcoal (placed in a glass tube), which when cold absorbs an equal weight of chlorine.
The tube was then fused up, the bent end cooled, and the charcoal heated, by which
means the chlorine was expelled from the charcoal, and the pressure increased.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_629" id="Footnote_8_629"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_629"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Judging from Ludwig's observations (1868), and from the fact that the coefficient of
expansion of gases increases with their molecular weight (Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_26_150">26</a>, for hydrogen
= 0·367, carbonic anhydride = 0·373, hydrogen bromide = 0·386), it might be expected that
the expansion of chlorine would be greater than that of air or of the gases composing it.
V. Meyer and Langer (1885) having remarked that at 1,400° the density of chlorine (taking
its expansion as equal to that of nitrogen) = 29, consider that the molecules of chlorine
split up and partially give molecules Cl, but it might be maintained that the decrease in
density observed only depends on the increase of the coefficient of expansion.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_630" id="Footnote_9_630"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_630"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> Investigations on the solubility of chlorine in water (the solutions evolve all their
chlorine on boiling and passing air through them) show many different peculiarities. First
Gay-Lussac, and subsequently Pelouze, determined that the solubility increases between
0° and 8°&ndash;10° (from 1&frac12; to 2 vols. of chlorine per 100 vols. of water at 0° up to 3 to 2&frac34; at 10°).
In the following note we shall see that this is not due to the breaking-up of the hydrate at
about 8° to 10°, but to its formation below 9°. Roscoe observed an increase in the solubility
of chlorine in the presence of hydrogen&mdash;even in the dark. Berthelot determined
an increase of solubility with the progress of time. Schönbein and others suppose that
chlorine acts on water, forming hypochlorous and hypochloric acids, (HClO + HCl).</p>

<p>The equilibrium between chlorine and steam as gases and between water, liquid
chlorine, ice, and the solid crystallo-hydrate of chlorine is evidently very complex. Gibbs,
Guldberg (1870) and others gave a theory for similar states of equilibrium, which was afterwards
developed by Roozeboom (1887), but it would be inopportune here to enter into its
details. It will be sufficient in the first place to mention that there is now no doubt
(according to the theory of heat, and the direct observations of Ramsay and Young) that
the vapour tensions at one and the same temperature are different for the liquid and
solid states of substances; secondly, to call attention to the following note; and, thirdly,
to state that, in the presence of the crystallo-hydrate, water between O°·24 and +28°·7
(when the hydrate and a solution may occur simultaneously) dissolves a different amount
of chlorine than it does in the absence of the crystallo-hydrate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_631" id="Footnote_10_631"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_631"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> According to Faraday's data the hydrate of chlorine contains Cl<sub>2</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, but Roozeboom
(1885) showed that it is poorer in water and = Cl<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O. At first small, almost
colourless, crystals are obtained, but they gradually form (if the temperature be below
their critical point 28°·7, above which they do not exist) large yellow crystals, like those of
potassium chromate. The specific gravity is 1·23. The hydrate is formed if there be
more chlorine in a solution than it is able to dissolve under the dissociation pressure
corresponding with a given temperature. <i>In the presence of the hydrate</i> the percentage
amount of chlorine at 0° = 0·5, at 9° = 0·9, and at 20° = 1·82. At temperatures below 9° the
solubility (determined by Gay-Lussac and Pelouze, <i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_9_630">9</a>) is dependent on the formation
of the hydrate; whilst at higher temperatures under the ordinary pressure the
hydrate cannot be formed, and the solubility of chlorine falls, as it does for all gases
(Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.). If the crystallo-hydrate is not formed, then below 9° the solubility follows
the same rule (6° 1·07 p.c. Cl, 9° 0·95 p.c.). According to Roozeboom, the chlorine evolved
by the hydrate presents the following tensions of dissociation: at 0° = 249 mm., at 4° = 398,
at 8° = 620, at 10° = 797, at 14° = 1,400 mm. In this case a portion of the crystallo-hydrate
remains solid. At 9°·6 the tension of dissociation is equal to the atmospheric pressure. At
a higher pressure the crystallo-hydrate may form at temperatures above 9° up to 28°·7,
when the vapour tension of the hydrate equals the tension of the chlorine. It is evident
that the equilibrium which is established is on the one hand a case of a complex heterogeneous
system, and on the other hand a case of the solution of solid and gaseous
substances in water.</p>

<p>The crystallo-hydrate or chlorine water must be kept in the dark, or the access of light
be prevented by coloured glass, otherwise oxygen is evolved and hydrochloric acid
formed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_632" id="Footnote_11_632"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_632"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The chemical action of light on a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen was discovered by
Gay-Lussac and Thénard (1809). It has been investigated by many savants, and especially
by Draper, Bunsen, and Roscoe. Electric or magnesium light, or the light emitted by
the combustion of carbon bisulphide in nitric oxide, and actinic light in general, acts in
the same manner as sunlight, in proportion to its intensity. At temperatures below -12°
light no longer brings about reaction, or at all events does not give an explosion. It was
long supposed that chlorine that had been subjected to the action of light was afterwards
able to act on hydrogen in the dark, but it was shown that this only takes place with
moist chlorine, and depends on the formation of oxides of chlorine. The presence of
foreign gases, and even of excess of chlorine or of hydrogen, very much enfeebles the
explosion, and therefore the experiment is conducted with a detonating mixture
prepared by the action of an electric current on a strong solution (sp. gr. 1·15) of hydrochloric
acid, in which case the water is not decomposed&mdash;that is, no oxygen becomes
mixed with the chlorine.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_633" id="Footnote_12_633"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_633"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> The quantity of chlorine and hydrogen which combine is proportional to the intensity
of the light&mdash;not of all the rays, but only those so-termed chemical (actinic) rays which
produce chemical action. Hence a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen, when exposed to
the action of light in vessels of known capacity and surface, may be employed as an actinometer&mdash;that
is, as a means for estimating the intensity of the chemical rays, the influence of
the heat rays being previously destroyed, which may be done by passing the rays through
water. Investigations of this kind (photo-chemical) showed that chemical action is
chiefly limited to the violet end of the spectrum, and that even the invisible ultra-violet
rays produce this action. A colourless gas flame contains no chemically active rays; the
flame coloured green by a salt of copper evinces more chemical action than the colourless
flame, but the flame brightly coloured yellow by salts of sodium has no more chemical
action than that of the colourless flame.</p>

<p>As the chemical action of light becomes evident in plants, photography, the bleaching
of tissues, and the fading of colours in the sunlight, and as a means for studying the
phenomenon is given in the reaction of chlorine on hydrogen, this subject has been the
most fully investigated in <i>photo-chemistry</i>. The researches of Bunsen and Roscoe in
the fifties and sixties are the most complete in this respect. Their actinometer contains
hydrogen and chlorine, and is surrounded by a solution of chlorine in water. The hydrochloric
acid is absorbed as it forms, and therefore the variation in volume indicates the
progress of the combination. As was to be expected, the action of light proved to be
proportional to the time of exposure and intensity of the light, so that it was possible to
conduct detailed photometrical investigations respecting the time of day and season of
the year, various sources of light, its absorption, &amp;c. This subject is considered in detail
in special works, and we only stop to mention one circumstance, that a small quantity of
a foreign gas decreases the action of light; for example, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>330</sub> of hydrogen by 38 p.c.,
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>200</sub> of oxygen by 10 p.c., <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>100</sub> of chlorine by 60 p.c., &amp;c. According to the researches of
Klimenko and Pekatoros (1889), the photo-chemical alteration of chlorine water is
retarded by the presence of traces of metallic chlorides, and this influence varies with
different metals.</p>

<p>As much heat is evolved in the reaction of chlorine on hydrogen, and as this
reaction, being exothermal, may proceed by itself, the action of light is essentially the
same as that of heat&mdash;that is, it brings the chlorine and hydrogen into the condition
necessary for the reaction&mdash;it, as we may say, disturbs the original equilibrium; this is
the work done by the luminous energy. It seems to me that the action of light on the
mixed gases should be understood in this sense, as Pringsheim (1877) pointed out.</p></div>

<p>With the first four elements the formation of the chlorine compound gives the most
heat, and with the four following the formation of the oxygen compound evolves the
greater amount of heat. The first four chlorides are true salts formed from HCl and the
oxide, whilst the remainder have other properties, as is seen from the fact that they are
not formed from hydrochloric acid and the oxide, but give hydrochloric acid with water.</p></div>

remarkable, because platinous chloride, PtCl<sub>2</sub>, is then formed, whilst this substance decomposes
at a much lower temperature into chlorine and platinum. Hence, when
chlorine comes into contact with platinum at such high temperatures, it forms fumes of
platinous chloride, and they on cooling decompose, with the liberation of platinum, so
that the phenomenon appears to be dependent on the volatility of platinum. Deville
proved the formation of platinous chloride by inserting a cold tube inside a red-hot one
(as in the experiment on carbonic oxide). However, V. Meyer was able to observe the
density of chlorine in a platinum vessel at 1,690°, at which temperature chlorine does not
exert this action on platinum, or at least only to an insignificant degree.</p></div>

longer acts on gold. Gay-Lussac, in explaining the action of aqua regia, showed that
when heated it evolves, besides chlorine, the vapours of two chloranhydrides&mdash;that of nitric
acid, NO<sub>2</sub>Cl (nitric acid, NO<sub>2</sub>OH, in which HO is replaced by chlorine; <i>see</i> Chapter on
Phosphorus), and that of nitrous acid, NOCl&mdash;but these do not act on gold. The
formation of aqua regia may therefore be expressed by 4NHO<sub>3</sub> + 8HCl = 2NO<sub>2</sub>Cl + 2NOCl
+ 6H<sub>2</sub>O + 2Cl<sub>2</sub>. The formation of the chlorides NO<sub>2</sub>Cl and NOCl is explained by the fact
that the nitric acid is deoxidised, gives the oxides NO and NO<sub>2</sub>, and they directly combine
with chlorine to form the above anhydrides.</p></div>

hydrogen is easily controlled by taking a weak solution, and as it has hardly any action
upon the tissues themselves, it is replacing chlorine more and more as a bleaching agent.
The oxidising property of chlorine is apparent in destroying the majority of organic
tissues, and proves fatal to organisms. This action of chlorine is taken advantage of in
quarantine stations. But the simple fumigation by chlorine must be carried on with
great care in dwelling places, because chlorine disengaged into the atmosphere renders
it harmful to the health.</p></div>

absorption of chlorine by charcoal (Note <a href="#Footnote_7_628">7</a>), but, so far as is at present known (if I am

were long known to exist in iodine and antimonious chloride, and have been most fully
studied by Gustavson and Friedel, of the Petroffsky Academy&mdash;the former with respect
to aluminium bromide, and the latter with respect to aluminium chloride. Gustavson
showed that if a trace of metallic aluminium be dissolved in bromine (it floats on bromine,
and when combination takes place much heat and light are evolved), the latter becomes
endowed with the property of entering into metalepsis, which it is not able to do of its
own accord. When pure, for instance, it acts very slowly on benzene, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, but in the
presence of a trace of aluminium bromide the reaction proceeds violently and easily, so
that each drop of the hydrocarbon gives a mass of hydrobromic acid, and of the product
of metalepsis. Gustavson showed that the <i>modus operandi</i> of this instructive reaction
is based on the property of aluminium bromide to enter into combination with hydrocarbons
and their derivatives. The details of this and all researches concerning the
metalepsis of the hydrocarbons must be looked for in works on organic chemistry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_24_645" id="Footnote_24_645"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_645"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> As small admixtures of iodine, aluminium bromide, &amp;c., aid the metalepsis of large
quantities of a substance, just as nitric oxide aids the reaction of sulphurous anhydride
on oxygen and water, so the principle is essentially the same in both cases. Effects of this
kind (which should also be explained by a chemical reaction proceeding at the surfaces)
only differ from true contact phenomena in that the latter are produced by solid bodies
and are accomplished at their surfaces, whilst in the former all is in solution. Probably
the action of iodine is founded on the formation of iodine chloride, which reacts more
easily than chlorine.</p></div>

compared with the energetic reaction of combustion. Many cases of substitution are
of this kind. Reactions of metalepsis are accompanied by an evolution of heat, but in a
less quantity than that evolved in the formation of the resulting quantity of the halogen
acids. Thus the reaction C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl + HCl, according to the data given by

dates from Lavoisier and Gay-Lussac) in organic chemistry, it was a very important
moment in its history when it became possible to gain an insight into the structure of
the radicles themselves. It was clear, for instance, that ethyl, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>, or the radicle of
common alcohol, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>·OH, passes, without changing, into a number of ethyl derivatives,
but its relation to the still simpler hydrocarbons was not clear, and occupied the attention
of science in the &lsquo;forties&rsquo; and &lsquo;fifties.&rsquo; Having obtained ethyl hydride, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>H = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, it
was looked on as containing the same ethyl, just as methyl hydride, CH<sub>4</sub> = CH<sub>3</sub>H, was
considered as existing in methane. Having obtained free methyl, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, from
it, it was considered as a derivative of methyl alcohol, CH<sub>3</sub>OH, and as only isomeric with
ethyl hydride. By means of the products of metalepsis it was proved that this is not a
case of isomerism but of strict identity, and it therefore became clear that ethyl is
methylated methyl, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> = CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>. In its time a still greater impetus was given by
the study of the reactions of monochloracetic acid, CH<sub>2</sub>Cl·COOH, or CO(CH<sub>2</sub>Cl)(OH).
It appeared that metalepsical chlorine, like the chlorine of chloranhydrides&mdash;for instance,
of methyl chloride, CH<sub>3</sub>Cl, or ethyl chloride, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl&mdash;is capable of substitution; for
example, glycollic acid, CH<sub>2</sub>(OH)(CO<sub>2</sub>H), or CO(CH<sub>2</sub>·OH)(OH), was obtained from it, and
it appeared that the OH in the group CH<sub>2</sub>(OH) reacted like that in alcohols, and it
became clear, therefore, that it was necessary to examine the radicles themselves by
analysing them from the point of view of the bonds connecting the constituent atoms.
Whence arose the present doctrine of the structure of the carbon compounds. (<i>See</i>
Chapter VIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_42_488">42</a>.)</p></div>

only explain the indirect formation of CCl<sub>4</sub>, NCl<sub>3</sub>, and Cl<sub>2</sub>O by one method, but we also
arrive at the fact that the reactions of the metalepsis of the hydrocarbons lose that
exclusiveness which was often ascribed to them. Also by subjecting the chemical representations
to the law of substitution we may foretell metalepsis as a particular case of a
general law.</p></div>

of chlorine water be poured into a beaker, and a small quantity of a solution of ammonia
be added, then, after shaking, nitrogen is evolved. If chlorine act on a dilute solution
of ammonia, the volume of nitrogen does not correspond with the volume of the
chlorine taken, because ammonium hypochlorite is formed. If ammonia gas be passed
through a fine orifice into a vessel containing chlorine, the reaction of the formation
of nitrogen is accompanied by the emission of light and the appearance of a cloud of sal-ammoniac.
In all these instances an excess of chlorine must be present.</p></div>

ammonia or its salt. If bubbles of chlorine be passed through a fine tube into a vessel
containing ammonia gas, each bubble gives rise to an explosion. If, however,
chlorine be passed into a solution of ammonia, the reaction at first brings about
the formation of nitrogen, because chloride of nitrogen acts on ammonia like chlorine.
But when sal-ammoniac has begun to form, then the reaction directs itself towards
the formation of chloride of nitrogen. The first action of chlorine on a solution of
sal-ammoniac always causes the formation of chloride of nitrogen, which then reacts on
ammonia thus: NCl<sub>3</sub> + 4NH<sub>3</sub> = N<sub>2</sub> + 3NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Therefore, so long as the liquid is alkaline
from the presence of ammonia the chief product will be nitrogen. The reaction
NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> = NCl<sub>3</sub> + 4HCl is reversible; with a dilute solution it proceeds in the above-described
direction (perhaps owing to the affinity of the hydrochloric acid for the excess
of water), but with a strong solution of hydrochloric acid it takes the opposite direction
(probably by virtue of the affinity of hydrochloric acid for ammonia). Therefore there
must exist a very interesting case of equilibrium between ammonia, hydrochloric acid,
chlorine, water, and chloride of nitrogen which has not yet been investigated. The reaction
NCl<sub>3</sub> + 4HCl = NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + 3Cl<sub>2</sub> enabled Deville and Hautefeuille to determine the
composition of chloride of nitrogen. When slowly decomposed by water, chloride of
nitrogen gives, like a chloranhydride, nitrous acid or its anhydride, 2NCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O
= N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> + 6HCl. From these observations it is evident that chloride of nitrogen presents
great chemical interest, which is strengthened by its analogy with trichloride of phosphorus.
The researches of F. F. Selivanoff (1891&ndash;94) prove that NCl<sub>3</sub> may be regarded
as an ammonium derivative of hypochlorous acid. Chloride of nitrogen is decomposed by
dilute sulphuric acid in the following manner: NCl<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = NH<sub>4</sub>HSO<sub>4</sub> + 3HClO.
This reaction is reversible and is only complete when some substance, combining with
HClO (for instance, succinimide) or decomposing it, is added to the liquid. This is
easily understood from the fact that hypochlorous acid itself, HClO, may, according to
the view held in this book, be regarded as the product of the metalepsis of water, and
consequently bears the same relation to NCl<sub>3</sub> as H<sub>2</sub>O does to NH<sub>3</sub>, or as RHO to
RNH<sub>2</sub>, R<sub>2</sub>NH, and R<sub>3</sub>N&mdash;that is to say, NCl<sub>3</sub> corresponds as an ammonium derivative to
ClOH and Cl<sub>2</sub> in exactly the same manner as NR<sub>3</sub> corresponds to ROH and R<sub>2</sub>. The
connection of NCl<sub>3</sub> and other similar explosive chloro-nitrogen compounds (called
chloryl compounds by Selivanoff; for example, the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>NCl<sub>2</sub> of Wurtz is chloryl ethylamine),
such as NRCl<sub>2</sub> (as NC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>), and NR<sub>2</sub>Cl (for instance, N(CH<sub>3</sub>CO)HCl, chlorylacetamide,
and N(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl, chloryl diethylamine) with HClO is evident from the fact
that under certain circumstances these compounds give hypochlorous acid, with water, for
instance, NR<sub>2</sub>Cl + H<sub>2</sub>O = NR<sub>2</sub>H + HClO, and frequently act (like NCl<sub>3</sub> and HClO, or Cl<sub>2</sub>)
in an oxidising and chloridising manner. We may take chloryl succinimide, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(CO)<sub>2</sub>NCl
for example. It was obtained by Bender by the action of HClO upon succinimide,
C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(CO)<sub>2</sub>NH, and is decomposed by water with the re-formation of amide and HClO
(the reaction is reversible). Selivanoff obtained, investigated, and classified many of
the compounds NR<sub>2</sub>Cl and NRCl<sub>2</sub>, where R is a residue of organic acids or alcohols, and
showed their distinction from the chloranhydrides, and thus supplemented the history of
chloride of nitrogen, which is the simplest of the amides containing chlorine, NR<sub>3</sub>, where
R is fully substituted by chlorine.</p></div>

and care should he taken that the NCl<sub>3</sub> remains under a layer of water. Whenever an
ammoniacal substance comes into contact with chlorine great care must be taken,
because it may be a case of the formation of such products and a very dangerous explosion
may ensue. The liquid product of the metalepsis of ammonia may be most safely prepared
in the form of small drops by the action of a galvanic current on a slightly warm
solution of sal-ammoniac; chlorine is then evolved at the positive pole, and this chlorine
acting on the ammonia gradually forms the product of metalepsis which floats on the
surface of the liquid (being carried up by the gas), and if a layer of turpentine be
poured on to it these small drops, on coming into contact with the turpentine, give feeble
explosions, which are in no way dangerous owing to the small mass of the substance
formed. Drops of chloride of nitrogen may with great caution be collected for
investigation in the following manner. The neck of a funnel is immersed in a basin containing
mercury, and first a saturated solution of common salt is poured into the funnel,
and above it a solution of sal-ammoniac in 9 parts of water. Chlorine is then slowly
passed through the solutions, when drops of chloride of nitrogen fall into the salt
water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_652" id="Footnote_30_652"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_652"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Quicklime, CaO (or calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>), does not absorb chlorine when cold,
but at a red heat, in a current of chlorine, it forms calcium chloride, with the evolution
of oxygen. (This was confirmed in 1893 by Wells, at Oxford.) This reaction corresponds
with the decomposing action of chlorine on methane, ammonia, and water. Slaked lime
(calcium hydroxide, CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) also, when dry, does not absorb chlorine at 100°. The
absorption proceeds at the ordinary temperature (below 40°). The dry mass thus obtained
contains not less than three equivalents of calcium hydroxide to four equivalents
of chlorine, so that its composition is [Ca(HO)<sub>2</sub>]<sub>5</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>. In all probability a simple absorption
of chlorine by the lime at first takes place in this case, as may be seen from the fact
that even carbonic anhydride, when acting on the dry mass obtained as above, disengages
all the chlorine from it, leaving only calcium carbonate. But if the bleaching powder be
obtained by a wet method, or if it be dissolved in water (in which it is very soluble), and
carbonic anhydride be passed into it, then chlorine is no longer disengaged, but chlorine
oxide, Cl<sub>2</sub>O, and only half of the chlorine is converted into this oxide, while the other half
remains in the liquid as calcium chloride. From this it may be inferred that calcium
chloride is formed by the action of water on bleaching powder, and this is proved to be
the case by the fact that small quantities of water extract a considerable amount of
calcium chloride from bleaching powder. If a large quantity of water act on bleaching
powder an excess of calcium hydroxide remains, a portion of which is not subjected to
change. The action of the water may be expressed by the following formulæ: From the
dry mass Ca<sub>3</sub>(HO)<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> there is formed lime, Ca(HO)<sub>2</sub>, calcium chloride, CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and a
saline substance, Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub>. Ca<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub> = CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CaCl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O. The resulting
substances are not equally soluble; water first extracts the calcium chloride,
which is the most soluble, then the compound Ca(ClO)<sub>2</sub> and ultimately calcium hydroxide
is left. A mixture of calcium chloride and hypochlorite passes into solution. On evaporation
there remains Ca<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>4</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O. The dry bleaching powder does not absorb more
chlorine, but the solution is able to absorb it in considerable quantity. If the liquid be
boiled, a considerable amount of chlorine monoxide is evolved. After this calcium
chloride alone remains in solution, and the decomposition may be expressed as follows:
CaCl<sub>2</sub> + CaCl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + 2Cl<sub>2</sub> = 2CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2Cl<sub>2</sub>O. Chlorine monoxide may be prepared in this
manner.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that bleaching powder contains a substance, Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>, that is
calcium peroxide, CaO<sub>2</sub>, in which one atom of oxygen is replaced by (OH)<sub>2</sub>, and the other
by Cl<sub>2</sub>; but, judging from what has been said above, this can only be the case in the dry
state, and not in solutions.</p>

<p>On being kept for some time, bleaching powder sometimes decomposes, with the
evolution of oxygen (because CaCl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = CaCl<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub>, <i>see</i> p. <a href="#Page_163">163</a>); the same takes place
when it is heated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_653" id="Footnote_31_653"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_653"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> For this reason it is necessary that in the preparation of bleaching powder the chlorine
should be free from hydrochloric acid, and even the lime from calcium chloride. An
excess of chlorine, in acting on a solution of bleaching powder, may also give chlorine
monoxide, because calcium carbonate also gives chlorine monoxide under the action of
chlorine. This reaction may be brought about by treating freshly precipitated calcium
carbonate with a stream of chlorine in water: 2Cl<sub>2</sub> + CaCO<sub>3</sub> = CO<sub>2</sub> + CaCl<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>O. From
this we may conclude that, although carbonic anhydride displaces hypochlorous anhydride,
it may be itself displaced by an excess of the latter.</p></div>

(chlorine monoxide) (Balard); when mixed with water, red mercury oxide acts feebly on
chlorine, and when freshly precipitated it evolves oxygen and chlorine. An oxide of
mercury which easily and abundantly evolves chlorine monoxide under the action of
chlorine in the presence of water may be prepared as follows: the oxide of mercury,
precipitated from a mercuric salt by an alkali, is heated to 300° and cooled (Pelouze). If
a salt, MClO, be added to a solution of mercuric salt, HgX<sub>2</sub>, mercuric oxide is liberated,
because the hypochlorite is decomposed.</p></div>

on many salts; for example, in the action of chlorine on a solution of sodium sulphate
the following reaction takes place: Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub> = NaCl + HClO + NaHSO<sub>4</sub>. Here
the hypochlorous acid is formed, together with HCl, at the expense of chlorine and
water, for Cl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = HCl + HClO. If the crystallo-hydrate of chlorine be mixed with
mercury oxide, the hydrochloric acid formed in the reaction gives mercury chloride,
and hypochlorous acid remains in solution. A dilute solution of hypochlorous acid
or chlorine monoxide may be concentrated by distillation, and if a substance which
takes up water (without destroying the acid)&mdash;for instance, calcium nitrate&mdash;be added
to the stronger solution, then the anhydride of hypochlorous acid&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> chlorine monoxide&mdash;is
disengaged.</p></div>

nitrogen, nitro-compounds, &amp;c. Hence they cannot be formed directly from the elements

state chlorine monoxide explodes even on contact with powdery substances, or when
rapidly agitated&mdash;for instance, if a file be rasped over the vessel in which it is contained.</p></div>

<p>The capacity of hypochlorous acid (studied by Carius and others) for entering into combination
with the unsaturated hydrocarbons is very often taken advantage of in organic

others) in many respects resembles hypochlorous acid, HClO, whilst they both differ from
chloric and perchloric acids in their degree of stability, which is expressed, for instance,
in their bleaching properties; the two higher acids do not bleach, but both the lower
ones do so (oxidise at the ordinary temperature). On the other hand, chlorous acid is
analogous to nitrous acid, HNO<sub>2</sub>. The anhydride of chlorous acid, Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is not known
in a pure state, but it probably occurs in admixture with chlorine dioxide, ClO<sub>2</sub>, which is
obtained by the action of nitric and sulphuric acids on a mixture of potassium chlorate
with such reducing substances as nitric oxide, arsenious oxide, sugar, &amp;c. All that is at
present known is that pure chlorine dioxide ClO<sub>2</sub> (<i>see</i> Notes <a href="#Footnote_39_662">39</a>&ndash;<a href="#Footnote_43_666">43</a>) is gradually converted
into a mixture of hypochlorous and chlorous acids under the action of water (and alkalis);

2ClO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = HClO<sub>3</sub> + HClO<sub>2</sub>. The silver salt, AgClO<sub>2</sub>, is sparingly soluble in

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_659" id="Footnote_36_659"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_659"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Hydrochloric acid, which is an example of compounds of this kind, is a saturated
substance which does not combine directly with oxygen, but in which, nevertheless,
a considerable quantity of oxygen may be inserted between the elements forming it.
The same may be observed in a number of other cases. Thus oxygen may be added
or inserted between the elements, sometimes in considerable quantities, in the saturated
hydrocarbons; for instance, in C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>, three atoms of oxygen produce an alcohol, glycerin
or glycerol, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>. We shall meet with similar examples hereafter. This is
generally explained by regarding oxygen as a bivalent element&mdash;that is, as capable of
combining with two different elements, such as chlorine, hydrogen, &amp;c. On the basis of
this view, it may be inserted between each pair of combined elements; the oxygen will
then be combined with one of the elements by one of its affinities and with the other
element by its other affinity. This view does not, however, express the entire truth
of the matter, even when applied to the compounds of chlorine. Hypochlorous acid,
HOCl&mdash;that is, hydrochloric acid in which one atom of oxygen is inserted&mdash;is, as we have
already seen, a substance of small stability; it might therefore be expected that on the
addition of a fresh quantity of oxygen, a still less stable substance would be obtained,
because, according to the above view, the chlorine and hydrogen, which form such a
stable compound together, are then still further removed from each other. But it appears
that chloric and perchloric acid, HClO<sub>3</sub> and HClO<sub>4</sub>, are much more stable substances.
Furthermore, the addition of oxygen has also its limit, it can only be added to a certain
extent. If the above representation were true and not merely hypothetical, there
would be no limit to the combination of oxygen, and the more it entered into one continuous
chain the more unstable would be the resultant compound. But not more than four
atoms of oxygen can be added to hydrogen sulphide, nor to hydrochloric acid, nor to
hydrogen phosphide. This peculiarity must lie in the properties of oxygen itself; four
atoms of oxygen seem to have the power of forming a kind of radicle which retains two
or several atoms of various other substances&mdash;for example, chlorine and hydrogen,
hydrogen and sulphur, sodium and manganese, phosphorus and metals, &amp;c., forming
comparatively stable compounds, NaClO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, NaMnO<sub>4</sub>, Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c. <i>See</i> Chapter X.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_660" id="Footnote_37_660"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_660"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> If chlorine be passed through a <i>cold</i> solution of potash, a bleaching compound,
potassium chloride and hypochlorite, KCl + KClO, is formed, but if it be passed through
a <i>hot</i> solution potassium chlorate is formed. As this is sparingly soluble in water, it
chokes the gas-conducting tube, which should therefore be widened out at the end.</p>

<p>Potassium chlorate is usually obtained on a large scale from calcium chlorate, which
is prepared by passing chlorine (as long as it is absorbed) into water containing lime, the
mixture being kept warm. A mixture of calcium chlorate and chloride is thus formed
in the solution. Potassium chloride is then added to the warm solution, and on cooling
a precipitate of potassium chlorate is formed as a substance which is sparingly soluble in
cold water, especially in the presence of other salts. The double decomposition taking
place is Ca(ClO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2KCl = CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 2KClO<sub>3</sub>. On a small scale in the laboratory potassium
chlorate is best prepared from a strong solution of bleaching powder by passing chlorine
through it and then adding potassium chloride. KClO<sub>3</sub> is always formed by the action
of an electric current on a solution of KCl, especially at 80° (Häussermann and Naschold,
1894), so that this method is now used on a large scale.</p>

<p>Potassium chlorate crystallises easily in large colourless tabular crystals. Its solubility
in 100 parts of water at 0° = 3 parts, 20° = 8 parts, 40° = 14 parts, 60° = 25 parts,
80° = 40 parts. For comparison we will cite the following figures showing the solubility
of potassium chloride and perchlorate in 100 parts of water: potassium chloride at O° = 28
parts, 20° = 35 parts, 40° = 40 parts, 100° = 57 parts; potassium perchlorate at 0° about
1 part, 20° about 1&frac34; part, 100° about 18 parts. When heated, potassium chlorate melts
(the melting point has been given as from 335°&ndash;376°; according to the latest determination
by Carnelley, 359°) and decomposes with the evolution of oxygen, potassium perchlorate
being at first formed, as will afterwards be described (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_47_670">47</a>). A mixture of
potassium chlorate and nitric and hydrochloric acids effects oxidation and chlorination
in solutions. It deflagrates when thrown upon incandescent carbon, and when mixed
with sulphur (&#8531; by weight) it ignites it on being struck, in which case an explosion
takes place. The same occurs with many metallic sulphides and organic substances.
Such mixtures are also ignited by a drop of sulphuric acid. All these effects are due to the
large amount of oxygen contained in potassium chlorate, and to the ease with which it
is evolved. A mixture of two parts of potassium chlorate, one part of sugar, and one
part of yellow prussiate of potash acts like gunpowder, but burns too rapidly, and
therefore bursts the guns, and it also has a very strong oxidising action on their metal.
The sodium salt, NaClO<sub>3</sub>, is much more soluble than the potassium salt, and it is
therefore more difficult to free it from sodium chloride, &amp;c. The barium salt is also
more soluble than the potassium salt; O° = 24 parts, 20° = 37 parts, 80° = 98 parts of salt
per 100 of water.</p></div>

The impure free chloric acid is obtained by converting the potassium in potassium
chlorate into an insoluble salt. This is done by adding tartaric or hydrofluosilicic
acid to a solution of potassium chlorate, because potassium tartrate and potassium silicofluoride
are very sparingly soluble in water. Chloric acid is easily soluble in water.</p></div>

salt, and 15 grams of powdered potassium chlorate are gradually added to the acid, which
is then carefully distilled at 20° to 40°, the vapour given off being condensed in a
freezing mixture. Potassium perchlorate is then formed: 3KClO<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> = 2KHSO<sub>4</sub>
+ KClO<sub>4</sub> + 2ClO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. The reaction may result in an explosion. Calvert and Davies
obtained chloric peroxide without the least danger by heating a mixture of oxalic
acid and potassium chlorate in a test tube in a water-bath. In this case 2KClO<sub>3</sub>
+ 3C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O = 2C<sub>2</sub>HKO<sub>4</sub> + 2CO<sub>2</sub> + 2ClO<sub>2</sub> + 8H<sub>2</sub>O. The reaction is still further facilitated
by the addition of a small quantity of sulphuric acid. If a solution of HCl acts
upon KClO<sub>3</sub> at the ordinary temperature, a mixture of Cl<sub>2</sub> and ClO<sub>2</sub> is formed, but if the
temperature be raised to 80° the greater part of the ClO<sub>2</sub> decomposes, and when passed
through a hot solution of MnCl<sub>2</sub> it oxidises it. Gooch and Kreider proposed (1894) to
employ this method for preparing small quantities of chlorine in the laboratory.</p></div>

carefully distilling and subjecting the crystals of the hydrate HClO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O obtained in
the distillate to a fresh distillation. Perchloric acid, HClO<sub>4</sub>, itself does not distil, and
is decomposed on distillation until the more stable hydrate HClO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O is formed; this
decomposes into HClO<sub>4</sub> and HClO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, which latter hydrate distils without decomposition.
This forms an excellent example of the influence of water on stability, and of
the property of chlorine of giving compounds of the type ClX<sub>7</sub>, of which all the above
hydrates, ClO<sub>3</sub>(OH), ClO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>, and ClO(OH)<sub>5</sub>, are members. Probably further research
will lead to the discovery of a hydrate Cl(OH)<sub>7</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_670" id="Footnote_47_670"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_670"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> The decomposition of salts analogous to potassium chlorate has been more fully
studied in recent years by Potilitzin and P. Frankland. Professor Potilitzin, by decomposing,
for example, lithium chlorate LiClO<sub>3</sub>, found (from the quantity of lithium
chloride and oxygen) that at first the decomposition of the fused salt (368°) takes place
according to the equation, 3LiClO<sub>3</sub> = 2LiCl + LiClO<sub>4</sub> + 5O, and that towards the end the
remaining salt is decomposed thus: 5LiClO<sub>3</sub> = 4LiCl + LiClO<sub>4</sub> + 10O. The phenomena
observed by Potilitzin obliged him to admit that lithium perchlorate is capable of decomposing
simultaneously with lithium chlorate, with the formation of the latter salt and
oxygen; and this was confirmed by direct experiment, which showed that lithium chlorate
is always formed in the decomposition of the perchlorate. Potilitzin drew particular
attention to the fact that the decomposition of potassium chlorate and of salts analogous
to it, although exothermal (Chapter III., Note <a href="#Footnote_12_186">12</a>), not only does not proceed spontaneously,
but requires time and a rise of temperature in order to attain completion,
which again shows that chemical equilibria are not determined by the heat effects of reactions
only.</p>

<p>P. Frankland and J. Dingwall (1887) showed that at 448° (in the vapour of sulphur)
a mixture of potassium chlorate and powdered glass is decomposed almost in accordance
with the equation 2KClO<sub>3</sub> = KClO<sub>4</sub> + KCl + O<sub>2</sub>, whilst the salt by itself evolves about half
as much oxygen, in accordance with the equation, 8KClO<sub>3</sub> = 5KClO<sub>4</sub> + 3KCl + 2O<sub>2</sub>. The
decomposition of potassium perchlorate in admixture with manganese peroxide proceeds
to completion, KClO<sub>4</sub> = KCl + 2O<sub>2</sub>. But in decomposing by itself the salt at first gives
potassium chlorate, approximately according to the equation 7KClO<sub>4</sub> = 2KClO<sub>3</sub> + 5KCl
+ 11O<sub>2</sub>. Thus there is now no doubt that when potassium chlorate is heated, the perchlorate
is formed, and that this salt, in decomposing with evolution of oxygen, again
gives the former salt.</p>

<p>In the decomposition of barium hypochlorite, 50 per cent. of the whole amount passes
into chlorate, in the decomposition of strontium hypochlorite (Potilitzin, 1890) 12·5 per
cent., and of calcium hypochlorite about 2·5 per cent. Besides which Potilitzin showed
that the decomposition of the hypochlorites and also of the chlorates is always accompanied
by the formation of a certain quantity of the oxides and by the evolution of
chlorine, the chlorine being displaced by the oxygen disengaged. Spring and Prost
(1889) represent the evolution of oxygen from KClO<sub>3</sub> as due to the salt first splitting up
into base and anhydride, thus (1) 2MClO<sub>3</sub> = M<sub>2</sub>O + Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>; (2) Cl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> = Cl<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>3</sub>; and (3)
M<sub>2</sub>O + Cl = 2MCl + O.</p>

<p>I may further remark that the decomposition of potassium chlorate as a reaction
evolving heat easily lends itself for this very reason to the contact action of manganese
peroxide and other similar admixtures; for such very feeble influences as those of
contact may become evident either in those cases (for instance, detonating gas,
hydrogen peroxide, &amp;c.), when the reaction is accompanied by the evolution of heat, or
when (for instance, H<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.) little heat is absorbed or evolved. In these cases it is
evident that the existing equilibrium is not very stable, and that a small alteration in the
conditions at the surfaces of contact may suffice to upset it. In order to conceive the
<i>modus operandi</i> of contact phenomena, it is enough to imagine, for instance, that at the
surface of contact the movement of the atoms in the molecules changes from a circular
to an elliptical path. Momentary and transitory compounds may he formed, but their
formation cannot affect the explanation of the phenomena.</p></div>

in the efforts made to obtain it, and from analogy, that it would decompose water (<i>see</i>
first Russian edition of the <i>Principles of Chemistry</i>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_48_BIS_673" id="Footnote_48_BIS_673"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_BIS_673"><span class="label">[48 bis]</span></a> It is most likely that in this experiment of Fremy's, which corresponds with the
action of oxygen on calcium chloride, fluorine was set free, but that a converse reaction
also proceeded, CaO + F<sub>2</sub> = CaF<sub>2</sub> + O&mdash;that is, tbe calcium distributed itself between the
oxygen and fluorine. MnF<sub>4</sub>, which is capable of splitting up into MnF<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>2</sub>, is without
doubt formed by the action of a strong solution of hydrofluoric acid on manganese peroxide,
but under the action of water the fluorine gives hydrofluoric acid, and probably
this is aided by the affinity of the manganese fluoride and hydrofluoric acid. In all the
attempts made (by Davy, Knox, Louget, Fremy, Gore, and others) to decompose fluorides
(those of lead, silver, calcium, and others) by chlorine, there were doubtless also cases
of distribution, a portion of the metal combined with chlorine and a portion of the fluorine
was evolved; but it is improbable that any decisive results were obtained. Fremy probably
obtained fluorine, but not in a pure state.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_674" id="Footnote_49_674"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_674"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> According to Moissan, fluorine is disengaged by the action of an electric current
on fused hydrogen potassium fluoride, KHF<sub>2</sub>. The present state of chemical knowledge
is such that the knowledge of the properties of an element is much more general than
the knowledge of the free element itself. It is useful and satisfactory to learn that
even fluorine in the free state has not succeeded in eluding experiment and research,
that the efforts to isolate it have been crowned with success, but the sum total of
chemical data concerning fluorine as an element gains but little by this achievement. The
gain will, however, be augmented if it be now possible to subject fluorine to a comparative
study in relation to oxygen and chlorine. There is particular interest in the phenomena
of the distribution of fluorine and oxygen, or fluorine and chlorine, competing under
different conditions and relations. We may add that Moissan (1892) found that free
fluorine decomposes H<sub>2</sub>S, HCl, HBr, CS<sub>2</sub>, and CNH with a flash; it does not act upon
O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and CO<sub>2</sub>; Mg, Al, Ag, and Ni, when heated, burn in it, as also do S, Se, P (forms
PF<sub>5</sub>); it reacts upon H<sub>2</sub> even in the dark, with the evolution of 366·00 units of heat. At
a temperature of -95°, F<sub>2</sub> still retains its gaseous state. Soot and carbon in general (but
not the diamond) when heated in gaseous fluorine form <i>fluoride of carbon</i>, CF<sub>4</sub>
(Moissan, 1890); this compound is also formed at 300° by the double decomposition of
CCl<sub>4</sub> and AgF; it is a gas which liquefies at 10° under a pressure of 5 atmospheres.
With an alcoholic solution of KHO, CF<sub>4</sub> gives K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, according to the equation CF<sub>4</sub> + 6KHO
= K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 4KF + 3H<sub>2</sub>O. CF<sub>4</sub> is not soluble in water, but it is easily soluble in CCl<sub>4</sub> and
alcohol.</p></div>

and a double ammonium salt of tetrachloride of lead (starting from the binoxide),
PbCl<sub>4</sub>2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl; Hutchinson and Pallard obtained a similar salt of acetic acid (1893)
corresponding to PbX<sub>4</sub> by treating red lead with strong acetic acid; the composition of
this salt is Pb(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>4</sub>; it melts (and decomposes) at about 175°. Brauner (1894)
obtained a salt corresponding to tetrafluoride of lead, PbF<sub>4</sub>, and the acid corresponding
to it, H<sub>4</sub>PbF<sub>8</sub>. For example, by treating potassium plumbate (Chapter XVIII. Note 55)
with strong HF, and also the above-mentioned tetra-acetate with a solution of KHF<sub>2</sub>,
Brauner obtained crystalline HK<sub>3</sub>PbF<sub>8</sub>&mdash;i.e. the salt from which he obtained fluorine.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_676" id="Footnote_50_676"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_676"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> It is called spar because it very frequently occurs as crystals of a clearly laminar
structure, and is therefore easily split up into pieces bounded by planes. It is called fluor
spar because when used as a flux it renders ores fusible, owing to its reacting with silica,
SiO<sub>2</sub> + 2CaF<sub>2</sub> = 2CaO + SiF<sub>4</sub>; the silicon fluoride escapes as a gas and the lime combines
with a further quantity of silica, and gives a vitreous slag. Fluor spar occurs in mineral
veins and rocks, sometimes in considerable quantities. It always crystallises in the cubic
system, sometimes in very large semi-transparent cubic crystals, which are colourless or
of different colours. It is insoluble in water. It melts under the action of heat, and
crystallises on cooling. The specific gravity is 3·1. When steam is passed over incandescent
fluor spar, lime and hydrofluoric acid are formed: CaF<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = CaO + 2HF. A
double decomposition is also easily produced by fusing fluor spar with sodium or potassium
hydroxides, or potash, or even with their carbonates; the fluorine then passes over to the
potassium or sodium, and the oxygen to the calcium. In solutions&mdash;for example,
Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2KF = CaF<sub>2</sub> (precipitate) + 2KNO<sub>3</sub> (in solution)&mdash;the formation of calcium
fluoride takes place, owing to its very sparing solubility. 26,000 parts of water dissolve
one part of fluor spar.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_51_677" id="Footnote_51_677"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_677"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> According to Gore. Fremy obtained anhydrous hydrofluoric acid by decomposing
lead fluoride at a red heat, by hydrogen, or by beating the double salt HKF<sub>2</sub>, which
easily crystallises (in cubes) from a solution of hydrofluoric acid, half of which has been
saturated with potassium hydroxide. Its vapour density corresponds to the formula HF.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_678" id="Footnote_52_678"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_678"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> This composition corresponds to the crystallo-hydrate HCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O. All the properties
of hydrofluoric acid recall those of hydrochloric acid, and therefore the comparative
ease with which hydrofluoric acid is liquefied (it boils at +19°, hydrochloric
acid at -35°) must be explained by a polymerisation taking place at low temperatures,
as will be afterwards explained, H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> being formed, and therefore in a liquid state it
differs from hydrochloric acid, in which a phenomenon of a similar kind has not yet been
observed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_679" id="Footnote_53_679"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_679"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> The corrosive action of hydrofluoric acid on glass and similar siliceous compounds
is based upon the fact that it acts on silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, as we shall consider more fully in
describing that compound, forming gaseous silicon fluoride, SiO<sub>2</sub> + 4HF = SiF<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.
Silica, on the other hand, forms the binding (acid) element of glass and of the mass of
mineral substances forming the salts of silica. When it is removed the cohesion is destroyed.
This is made use of in the arts, and in the laboratory, for etching designs and
scales, &amp;c., on glass. In <i>engraving on glass</i> the surface is covered with a varnish composed
of four parts of wax and one part of turpentine. This varnish is not acted on by
hydrofluoric acid, and it is soft enough to allow of designs being drawn upon it whose lines
lay bare the glass. The drawing is made with a steel point, and the glass is afterwards
laid in a lead trough in which a mixture of fluor spar and sulphuric acid is placed. The
sulphuric acid must be used in considerable excess, as otherwise transparent lines are
obtained (owing to the formation of hydrofluosilicic acid). After being exposed for some
time, the varnish is removed (melted) and the design drawn by the steel point is found
reproduced in dull lines. The drawing may be also made by the direct application of a
mixture of a silicofluoride and sulphuric acid, which forms hydrofluoric acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_680" id="Footnote_54_680"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_680"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> Mallet (1881) determined the density at 30° and 100°, previous to which Gore
(1869) had determined the vapour density at 100°, whilst Thorpe and Hambly (1888)
made fourteen determinations between 26° and 88°, and showed that within this limit of
temperature the density gradually diminishes, just like the vapour of acetic acid, nitrogen
dioxide, and others. The tendency of HF to polymerise into H<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub> is probably connected
with the property of many fluorides of forming acid salts&mdash;for example, KHF<sub>2</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>SiF<sub>6</sub>. We saw above that HCl has the same property (forming, for instance, H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>,
&amp;c., p. 457), and hence this property of hydrofluoric acid does not stand isolated from the
properties of the other halogens.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_55_681" id="Footnote_55_681"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_681"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> For instance, the experiment with Dutch metal foil (Note <a href="#Footnote_16_637">16</a>) may be made with
bromine just as well as with chlorine. A very instructive experiment on the direct combination
of the halogens with metals maybe made by throwing a small piece (a shaving)
of aluminium into a vessel containing liquid bromine; the aluminium, being lighter, floats
on the bromine, and after a certain time reaction sets in accompanied by the evolution
of heat, light, and fumes of bromine. The incandescent piece of metal moves rapidly
over the surface of the bromine in which the resultant aluminium bromide dissolves.
For the sake of comparison we will proceed to cite several thermochemical data (Thomsen)
for analogous actions of (1) chlorine, (2) bromine, and (3) iodine, with respect to
metals; the halogen being expressed by the symbol X, and the plus sign connecting the
reacting substances. All the figures are given in thousands of calories, and refer to
molecular quantities in grams and to the ordinary temperature:&mdash;</p>

<p>We may remark that the latent heat of vaporisation of the molecular weight Br<sub>2</sub> is about
7·2, and of iodine 6·0 thousand heat units, whilst the latent heat of fusion of Br<sub>2</sub> is about
0·3, and of I<sub>2</sub> about 3·0 thousand heat units. From this it is evident that the difference
between the amounts of heat evolved does not depend on the difference in physical state.
For instance, the vapour of iodine in combining with Zn to form ZnI<sub>2</sub> would give
48 + 8 + 3, or about sixty thousand heat units, or 1&frac12; times less than Zn + Cl<sub>2</sub>.</p></div>

bromine chloride; this is more soluble in water than bromine, from which it may thus
be freed. To obtain pure bromine the commercial bromine is washed with water, dried
by sulphuric acid, and distilled, the portion coming over at 58° being collected; the
greater part is then converted into potassium bromide and dissolved, and the remainder
is added to the solution in order to separate iodine, which is removed by shaking with
carbon bisulphide. By heating the potassium bromide thus obtained with manganese
peroxide and sulphuric acid, bromine is obtained quite free from iodine, which, however,
is not present in certain kinds of commercial bromine (the Stassfurt, for instance). By
treatment with potash, the bromine is then converted into a mixture of potassium
bromide and bromate, and the mixture (which is in the proportion given in the equation)

<p>B. Roozeboom investigated the hydrate of bromine as completely as the hydrate of
chlorine (Notes <a href="#Footnote_9_630">9</a>, <a href="#Footnote_10_631">10</a>). The temperature of the complete decomposition of the hydrate is
+6°·2; the density of Br<sub>2</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O = 1·49.</p></div>

it is easily evolved. For this reason compounds corresponding with the higher stages of
oxidation or chlorination frequently give a lower stage when treated with hydriodic acid.
Ferric oxide, Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, is a higher oxide, and ferrous oxide, FeO, a lower oxide; the former
corresponds with FeX<sub>3</sub>, and the latter with FeX<sub>2</sub>, and this passage from the higher to the
lower takes place under the action of hydriodic acid. Thus hydrogen peroxide and
ozone (Chapter <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>.) are able to liberate iodine from hydriodic acid. Compounds of copper
oxide, CuO or CuX<sub>2</sub>, give compounds of the suboxide Cu<sub>2</sub>O, or CuX. Even sulphuric acid,
which corresponds to the higher stage SO<sub>3</sub>, is able to act thus, forming the lower oxide
SO<sub>2</sub>. The liberation of iodine from hydriodic acid proceeds with still greater ease under
the action of substances capable of disengaging oxygen. In practice, many methods
are employed for liberating iodine from acid liquids containing, for example, sulphuric
acid and hydriodic acid. The higher oxides of nitrogen are most commonly used; they
then pass into nitric oxide. Iodine may even be disengaged from hydriodic acid by the
action of iodic acid, &amp;c. But there is a limit in these reactions of the oxidation of hydriodic
acid because, under certain conditions, especially in dilute solutions, the iodine
set free is itself able to act as an oxidising agent&mdash;that is, it exhibits the character
of chlorine, and of the halogens in general, to which we shall again have occasion to
refer. In Chili, where a large quantity of iodine is extracted in the manufacture of Chili
nitre, which contains NaIO<sub>3</sub>, it is mixed with the acid and normal sulphites of sodium
in solution; the iodine is then precipitated according to the equation 2NaIO<sub>3</sub> + 3Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>
+ 2NaHSO<sub>3</sub> = 5Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> +I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. The iodine thus obtained is purified by sublimation.</p></div>

in general, may serve, on the one hand, as an indication that solution is due to a similarity
between the solvent and dissolved substance, and, on the other hand, as an indirect proof
of that view as to solutions which was cited in Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>., because in many instances unstable
highly iodised compounds, resembling crystallo-hydrates, have been obtained from
such solutions. Thus iodide of tetramethylammonium, N(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>I, combines with I<sub>2</sub>, and I<sub>4</sub>.
Even a solution of iodine in a saturated solution of potassium iodide presents indications
of the formation of a definite compound KI<sub>3</sub>. Thus, an alcoholic solution of KI<sub>3</sub> does
not give up iodine to carbon bisulphide, although this solvent takes up iodine from an
alcoholic solution of iodine itself (Girault, Jörgensen, and others). The instability of these
compounds resembles the instability of many crystallo-hydrates, for instance of HCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_64_690" id="Footnote_64_690"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_690"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> The equality of the atomic volumes of the halogens themselves is all the more
remarkable because in all the halogen compounds the volume augments with the substitution
of fluorine by chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Thus, for example, the volume of
sodium fluoride (obtained by dividing the weight expressed by its formula by its specific
gravity) is about 15, of sodium chloride 27, of sodium bromide 32, and of sodium iodide 41.
The volume of silicon chloroform, SiHCl<sub>3</sub>, is 82, and those of the corresponding bromine
and iodine compounds are 108 and 122 respectively. The same difference also exists
in solutions; for example, NaCl + 200H<sub>2</sub>O has a sp. gr. (at 15°/4°) of 1·0106, consequently
the volume of the solution 3,658·5/1·0106 = 3,620, hence the volume of sodium chloride in
solution = 3,620&ndash;3,603 (this is the volume of 200 H<sub>2</sub>O) = 17, and in similar solutions,
NaBr = 26 and NaI = 35.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_65_691" id="Footnote_65_691"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_691"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> But the density (and also molecular volume, Note <a href="#Footnote_64_690">64</a>) of a bromine compound is
always greater than that of a chlorine compound, whilst that of an iodine compound
is still greater. The order is the same in many other respects. For example, an iodine
compound has a higher boiling point than a bromine compound, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_66_692" id="Footnote_66_692"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_692"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> A. L. Potilitzin showed that in heating various metallic chlorides in a closed tube,
with an equivalent quantity of bromine, a distribution of the metal between the halogens
always occurs, and that the amounts of chlorine replaced by the bromine in the ultimate
product are proportional to the atomic weights of the metals taken and inversely proportional
to their equivalence. Thus, if NaCl + Br be taken, then out of 100 parts of
chlorine, 5·54 are replaced by the bromine, whilst with AgCl + Br 27·28 parts are
replaced. These figures are in the ratio 1 : 4·9, and the atomic weights Na : Ag = 1 : 4·7.
In general terms, if a chloride MCl<sub><i>n</i></sub> be taken, it gives with <i>n</i>Br a percentage substitution
= 4M/<i>n</i><sup>2</sup> where M is the atomic weight of the metal. This law was deduced
from observations on the chlorides of Li, K, Na, Ag (<i>n</i> = 1), Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Ni, Hg, Pb
(<i>n</i> = 2), Bi (<i>n</i> = 3), Sn (<i>n</i> = 4), and Fe<sub>2</sub> (<i>n</i> = 6).</p>

<p>In these determinations of Potilitzin we see not only a brilliant confirmation of
Berthollet's doctrine, but also the first effort to directly determine the affinities of
elements by means of displacement. The chief object of these researches consisted in
proving whether a displacement occurs in those cases where heat is absorbed, and in
this instance it should be absorbed, because the formation of all metallic bromides is
attended with the evolution of less heat than that of the chlorides, as is seen by the
figures given in Note <a href="#Footnote_55_681">55</a>.</p>

<p>If the mass of the bromine be increased, then the amount of chlorine displaced also
increases. For example, if masses of bromine of 1 and 4 equivalents act on a molecule
of sodium chloride, then the percentages of the chlorine displaced will be 6·08 p.c. and
12·46 p.c.; in the action of 1, 4, 25, and 100 molecules of bromine on a molecule of
barium chloride, there will be displaced 7·8, 17·6, 35·0, and 45·0 p.c. of chlorine. If
an equivalent quantity of hydrochloric acid act on metallic bromides in closed tubes,
and in the absence of water at a temperature of 300°, then the percentages of the substitution
of the bromine by the chlorine in the double decomposition taking place between
univalent metals are inversely proportional to their atomic weights. For example,
NaBr + HCl gives at the limit 21 p.c. of displacement, KCl 12 p.c. and AgCl 4&frac14; p.c.
Essentially the same action takes place in an aqueous solution, although the phenomenon
is complicated by the participation of the water. The reactions proceed spontaneously in
one or the other direction at the ordinary temperature but at different <i>rates</i>. In the
action of a dilute solution (1 equivalent per 5 litres) of sodium chloride on silver bromide
at the ordinary temperature the amount of bromine replaced in six and a half days is
2·07 p.c., and with potassium chloride 1·5 p.c. With an excess of the chloride the magnitude
of the substitution increases. These conversions also proceed with the absorption
of heat. The reverse reactions evolving heat proceed incomparably more rapidly, but
also to a certain limit; for example, in the reaction AgCl + RBr the following percentages
of silver bromide are formed in different times:</p>

<p>That is, the conversions which are accompanied by an evolution of heat proceed

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_67_693" id="Footnote_67_693"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_693"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> <i>The dissociation of hydriodic acid</i> has been studied in detail by Hautefeuille and
Lemoine, from whose researches we extract the following information. The decomposition
of hydriodic acid is decided, but proceeds slowly at 180°; the rate and limit of
decomposition increase with a rise of temperature. The reverse action&mdash;that is, I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>
= 2HI&mdash;proceeds not only under the influence of spongy platinum (Corenwinder),
which also accelerates the decomposition of hydriodic acid, but also by itself, although
slowly. The limit of the reverse reaction remains the same with or without spongy
platinum. An increase of pressure has a very powerful accelerative effect on the
rate of formation of hydriodic acid, and therefore spongy platinum by condensing
gases has the same effect as increase of pressure. At the atmospheric pressure the
decomposition of hydriodic acid reaches the limit at 250° in several months, and at
440° in several hours. The limit at 250° is about 18 p.c. of decomposition&mdash;that is,
out of 100 parts of hydrogen previously combined in hydriodic acid, about 18 p.c. may
be disengaged at this temperature (this hydrogen may be easily measured, and the
measure of dissociation determined), but not more; the limit at 440° is about 26 p.c.
If the pressure under which 2HI passes into H<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> be 4&frac12; atmospheres, then the limit is
24 p.c.; under a pressure of &#8533; atmosphere the limit is 29 p.c. The small influence of
pressure on the dissociation of hydriodic acid (compared with N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, Chapter VI. Note <a href="#Footnote_46_378">46</a>)
is due to the fact that the reaction 2HI = I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> is not accompanied by a change of
volume. In order to show the influence of time, we will cite the following figures
referring to 350°: (1) Reaction H<sub>2</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>; after 3 hours, 88 p.c. of hydrogen remained free;
8 hours, 69 p.c.; 34 hours, 48 p.c.; 76 hours, 29 p.c.; and 327 hours, 18·5 p.c. (2) The
reverse decomposition of 2HI; after 9 hours, 3 p.c. of hydrogen was set free, and after
250 hours 18·6 p.c.&mdash;that is, the limit was reached. The addition of extraneous
hydrogen diminishes the limit of the reaction of decomposition, or increases the
formation of hydriodic acid from iodine and hydrogen, as would be expected from
Berthollet's doctrine (Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>.). Thus at 440° 26 p.c. of hydriodic acid is decomposed
if there be no admixture of hydrogen, while if H<sub>2</sub> be added, then at the limit only half
as large a mass of HI is decomposed. Therefore, if an infinite mass of hydrogen be
added there will be no decomposition of the hydriodic acid. Light aids the decomposition
of hydriodic acid very powerfully. At the ordinary temperature 80 p.c. is decomposed
under the influence of light, whilst under the influence of heat alone this limit corresponds
with a very high temperature. The distinct action of light, spongy platinum, and
of impurities in glass (especially of sodium sulphate, which decomposes hydriodic acid), not
only render the investigations difficult, but also show that in reactions like 2HI = I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>,
which are accompanied by slight heat effects, all foreign and feeble influences may strongly
affect the progress of the action (Note <a href="#Footnote_47_670">47</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_68_694" id="Footnote_68_694"></a><a href="#FNanchor_68_694"><span class="label">[68]</span></a> The thermal determinations of Thomsen (at 18°) gave in thousands of calories,
Cl + H = +22, HCl + Aq (that is, on dissolving HCl in a large amount of water) = +17·3,
and therefore H + Cl + Aq = +39·3. In taking molecules, all these figures must be
doubled. Br + H = +8·4; HBr + Aq = 19·9; H + Br + Aq = +28·3. According to Berthelot
7·2 are required for the vaporisation of Br<sub>2</sub>, hence Br<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> = 16·8 + 7·2 = +24,
if Br<sub>2</sub> be taken as vapour for comparison with Cl<sub>2</sub>. H + I = -6·0, HI + Aq = 19·2;
H + I + Aq= +13·2, and, according to Berthelot, the heat of fusion of I<sub>2</sub> = 3·0, and of
vaporisation 6·0 thousand heat units, and therefore I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> = -2(6·0) + 3 + 6 = -3·0, if the
iodine be taken as vapour. Berthelot, on the basis of his determinations, gives, however,
+0·8 thousand heat units. Similar contradictory results are often met with in thermochemistry
owing to the imperfection of the existing methods, and particularly the
necessity of depending on indirect methods for obtaining the fundamental figures. Thus
Thomsen decomposed a dilute solution of potassium iodide by gaseous chlorine; the
reaction gave +26·2, whence, having first determined the heat effects of the reactions
KHO + HCl, KHO + HI and Cl + H in aqueous solutions, it was possible to find H + I + Aq;
then, knowing HI + Aq, to find I + H. It is evident that unavoidable errors may
accumulate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_69_695" id="Footnote_69_695"></a><a href="#FNanchor_69_695"><span class="label">[69]</span></a> One can believe, however, on the basis of Berthollet's doctrine, and the observations
of Potilitzin (Note <a href="#Footnote_66_692">66</a>), that a certain slow decomposition of water by iodine
takes place. On this view the observations of Dossios and Weith on the fact that the
solubility of iodine in water increases after the lapse of several months will be comprehensible.
Hydriodic acid is then formed, and it increases the solubility. If the iodine be
extracted from such a solution by carbon bisulphide, then, as the authors showed, after
the action of nitrous anhydride iodine may be again detected in the solution by means of
starch. It can easily be understood that a number of similar reactions, requiring much
time and taking place in small quantities, have up to now eluded the attention of investigators,
who even still doubt the universal application of Berthollet's doctrine, or only
see the thermochemical side of reactions, or else neglect to pay attention to the element
of time and the influence of mass.</p></div>

be taken in the gaseous state (for sulphur the heat of fusion is 0·3, and the heat of

HBr, but more than that of HI. In dilute solutions H<sub>2</sub> + S + Aq = 9·3, and consequently
less than the formation of all the halogen acids, as H<sub>2</sub>S evolves but little heat with

these. It is evident that only the study of the simplest cases can give the key to the
more complex problems, and on the other hand it is evident from the examples cited in
the last pages that, without penetrating into the conditions of chemical equilibria, it
would be impossible to explain chemical phenomena. By following the footsteps of
Berthollet the possibility of unravelling the problems will be reached; but work in
this direction has only been begun during the last ten years, and much remains to be
done in collecting experimental material, for which occasions present themselves
at every step. In speaking of the halogens I wished to turn the reader's attention to

than it now is it would be possible to foretell all cases of preparation <i>with every
detail</i> (of the quantity of water, temperature, pressure, mass, &amp;c.) The study of
practical methods of preparation is therefore one of the paths for the study of chemical
mechanics. The reaction of iodine on phosphorus and water is a case like that mentioned
in Note <a href="#Footnote_74_700">74</a>, and the matter is here further complicated by the possibility of the
formation of the compound PH<sub>3</sub> with HI, as well as the production of PI<sub>2</sub>, PI<sub>3</sub>, and the
affinity of hydriodic acid and the acids of phosphorus for water. The theoretical
interest of equilibria in all their complexity is naturally very great, but it falls into the
background in presence of the primary interest of discovering practical methods for the
isolation of substances, and the means of employing them for the requirements of man.
It is only after the satisfaction of these requirements that interests of the other order
arise, which in their turn must exert an influence on the former. For these reasons,

to 180°. Gustavson proposed to prepare it by the action of bromine (best added in
drops together with traces of aluminium bromide) on anthracene (a solid hydrocarbon
from coal tar). Balard prepared it by passing bromine vapour over moist pieces of
common phosphorus. The liquid tribromide of phosphorus, directly obtained from
phosphorus and bromine, also gives hydrobromic acid when treated with water. Bromide
of potassium or sodium, when treated with sulphuric acid in the presence of
phosphorus, also gives hydrobromic acid, but hydriodic acid is decomposed by this
method. In order to free hydrobromic acid from bromine vapour it is passed over moist
phosphorus and dried either by phosphoric anhydride or calcium bromide (calcium
chloride cannot be used, as hydrochloric acid would be formed). Neither hydrobromic
nor hydriodic acids can be collected over mercury, on which they act, but they
may be directly collected in a dry vessel by leading the gas-conducting tube to the
bottom of the vessel, both gases being much heavier than air. Merz and Holtzmann
(1889) proposed to prepare HBr directly from bromine and hydrogen. For this purpose
pure dry hydrogen is passed through a flask containing boiling bromine. The mixture
of gas and vapour then passes through a tube provided with one or two bulbs, which
is heated moderately in the middle. Hydrobromic acid is formed with a series of flashes
at the part heated. The resultant HBr, together with traces of bromine, passes into a
Woulfe's bottle into which hydrogen is also introduced, and the mixture is then carried
through another heated tube, after which it is passed through water which dissolves the
hydrobromic acid. According to the method proposed by Newth (1892) a mixture of
bromine and hydrogen is led through a tube containing a platinum spiral, which is
heated to redness after the air has been displaced from the tube. If the vessel containing
the bromine be kept at 60°, the hydrogen takes up almost the theoretical amount
of bromine required for the formation of HBr. Although the flame which appears in the
neighbourhood of the platinum spiral does not penetrate into the vessel containing the
bromine, still, for safety, a tube filled with cotton wool may be interposed.</p>

<p>Hydriodic acid is obtained in the same manner as hydrobromic. The iodine is heated
in a small flask, and its vapour is carried over by hydrogen into a strongly heated tube,
The gas passing from the tube is found to contain a considerable amount of HI, together
with some free iodine. At a low red heat about 17 p.c. of the iodine vapour enters
into combination; at a higher temperature, 78 p.c. to 79 p.c.; and at a strong heat
about 82 p.c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_77_704" id="Footnote_77_704"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_704"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> But generally more phosphorus is taken than is required for the formation of
PI<sub>3</sub>, because otherwise a portion of the iodine distils over. If less than one-tenth part
of iodine be taken, much phosphonium iodide, PH<sub>4</sub>I, is formed. This proportion
was established by Gay-Lussac and Kolbe. Hydriodic acid is also prepared in many
other ways. Bannoff dissolves two parts of iodine in one part of a previously prepared
strong (sp. gr. 1·67) solution of hydriodic acid, and pours it on to red phosphorus in a
retort. Personne takes a mixture of fifteen parts of water, ten of iodine, and one of red
phosphorus, which, when heated, disengages hydriodic acid mixed with iodine vapour; the
latter is removed by passing it over moist phosphorus (Note <a href="#Footnote_76_703">76</a>). It must be remembered
however that reverse reaction (Oppenheim) may take place between the hydriodic acid
and phosphorus, in which the compounds PH<sub>4</sub>I and PI<sub>2</sub> are formed.</p>

<p>It should be observed that the reaction between phosphorus, iodine and water
must be carried out in the above proportions and with caution, as they may react with
explosion. With red phosphorus the reaction proceeds quietly, but nevertheless requires
care.</p>

<p>L. Meyer showed that with an excess of iodine the reaction proceeds without the
formation of bye-products (PH<sub>4</sub>I), according to the equation P + 5I + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = PH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> + 5HI.
For this purpose 100 grams of iodine and 10 grams of water are placed in a retort, and a
paste of 5 grams of red phosphorus and 10 grams of water is added little by little (at first
with great care). The hydriodic acid may be obtained free from iodine by directing the
neck of the retort upwards and causing the gas to pass through a shallow layer of water
(respecting the formation of HI, <i>see</i> also Note <a href="#Footnote_75_702">75</a>).</p></div>

<p>Hydrobromic acid forms two hydrates, HBr,2H<sub>2</sub>O and HBr,H<sub>2</sub>O, which have been
studied by Roozeboom with as much completeness as the hydrate of hydrochloric acid
(Chapter X. Note <a href="#Footnote_37_610">37</a>).</p>

<p>With metallic silver, solutions of hydriodic acid give hydrogen with great ease,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_78_BIS_706" id="Footnote_78_BIS_706"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_BIS_706"><span class="label">[78 bis]</span></a> Iodide of nitrogen, NHI<sub>2</sub> is obtained as a brown pulverulent precipitate on adding
a solution of iodine (in alcohol, for instance) to a solution of ammonia. If it be collected
on a filter-paper, it does not decompose so long as the precipitate is moist; but when dry
it explodes violently, so that it can only be experimented upon in small quantities.
Usually the filter-paper is torn into bits while moist, and the pieces laid upon a brick;
on drying an explosion proceeds not only from friction or a blow, but even spontaneously.
The more dilute the solution of ammonia, the greater is the amount of iodine required
for the formation of the precipitate of NHI<sub>2</sub>. A low temperature facilitates its formation.
NHI<sub>2</sub> dissolves in ammonia water, and when heated the solution forms HIO<sub>3</sub> and iodine.
With KI, iodide of nitrogen gives iodine, NH<sub>3</sub> and KHO. These reactions (Selivanoff)
are explained by the formation of HIO from NHI<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = NH<sub>3</sub> + 2HIO&mdash;and then
KI + HIO = I<sub>2</sub> + KHO. Selivanoff (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_29_650">29</a>) usually observed a temporary formation
of hypoiodous acid, HIO, in the reaction of ammonia upon iodine, so that
here the formation of NHI<sub>2</sub> is preceded by that of HIO&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> first I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = HIO + HI,
and then not only the HI combines with NH<sub>3</sub>, but also 2HIO + NH<sub>3</sub> = NHI<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O.
With dilute sulphuric acid iodide of nitrogen (like NCl<sub>3</sub>) forms hypoiodous acid, but it
immediately passes into iodic acid, as is expressed by the equation 5HIO = 2I<sub>2</sub> + HIO<sub>3</sub>
+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O (first 3HIO = HIO<sub>3</sub> + 2HI, and then HI + HIO = I<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O). Moreover, Selivanoff
found that iodide of nitrogen, NHI<sub>2</sub>, dissolves in an excess of ammonia water, and that
with potassium iodide the solution gives the reaction for hypoiodous acid (the evolution
of iodine in an alkaline solution). This shows that HIO participates in the formation
and decomposition of NHI<sub>2</sub>, and therefore the condition of the iodine (its metaleptic
position) in them is analogous, and differs from the condition of the halogens in the
haloid-anhydrides (for instance, NO<sub>2</sub>Cl). The latter are tolerably stable, while (the
haloid being designated by X) NHX<sub>2</sub>, NX<sub>3</sub>, XOH, RXO (<i>see</i> Chapter XIII. Note <a href="#Footnote_43_826">43</a>), &amp;c.,
are unstable, easily decomposed with the evolution of heat, and, under the action of
water, the haloid is easily replaced by hydrogen (Selivanoff), as would be expected in
true products of metalepsis.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_79_707" id="Footnote_79_707"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_707"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> Hypoiodous acid, HIO, is not known, but organic compounds, RIO, of this type
are known. To illustrate the peculiarities of their properties we will mention one
of these compounds, namely, <i>iodosobenzol</i>, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>IO. This substance was obtained
by Willgerodt (1892), and also by V. Meyer, Wachter, and Askenasy, by the action
of caustic alkalis upon phenoldiiodochloride, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>ICl<sub>2</sub> (according to the equation,
C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>ICl<sub>2</sub> + 2MOH = C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>IO + 2MCl + H<sub>2</sub>O). Iodosobenzol is an amorphous yellow substance,
whose melting point could not be determined because it explodes at 210°,
decomposing with the evolution of iodine vapour. This substance dissolves in hot water
and alcohol, but is not soluble in the majority of other neutral organic solvents. If
acids do not oxidise C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>IO, they give saline compounds in which iodosobenzol appears
as a basic oxide of a diatomic metal, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>I. Thus, for instance, when an acetic acid
solution of iodosobenzol is treated with a solution of nitric acid, it gives large monoclinic
crystals of a nitric acid salt having the composition C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>I(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (like Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>).
In appearing as the analogue of basic oxides, iodosobenzol displaces iodine from potassium
iodide (in a solution acidulated with acetic or hydrochloric acid)&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> it acts with its
oxygen like HClO. The action of peroxide of hydrogen, chromic acid, and other similar
oxidising agents gives iodoxybenzol, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>IO<sub>2</sub>, which is a neutral substance&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> incapable
of giving salts with acids (compare Chapter XIII. Note <a href="#Footnote_43_826">43</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_79_BIS_708" id="Footnote_79_BIS_708"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_BIS_708"><span class="label">[79 bis]</span></a> The oxidation of iodine by strong nitric acid was discovered by Connell; Millon
showed that it is effected, although more slowly, by the action of the hydrates of nitric
acid up to HNO<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, but that the solution HNO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, and weaker solutions, do not
oxidise, but simply dissolve, iodine. The participation of water in reactions is seen in
this instance. It is also seen, for example, in the fact that dry ammonia combines
directly with iodine&mdash;for instance, at 0° forming the compound I<sub>2</sub>,4NH<sub>3</sub>&mdash;whilst iodide of
nitrogen is only formed in presence of water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_80_709" id="Footnote_80_709"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_709"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> Bromine also displaces chlorine&mdash;for instance, from chloric acid, directly forming
bromic acid. If a solution of potassium chlorate be taken (75 parts per 400 parts of
water), and iodine be added to it (80 parts), and then a small quantity of nitric acid,
chlorine is disengaged on boiling, and potassium iodate is formed in the solution. In
this instance the nitric acid first evolves a certain portion of the chloric acid, and the
latter, with the iodine, evolves chlorine. The iodic acid thus formed acts on a further
quantity of the potassium chlorate, sets a portion of the chloric acid free, and in this
manner the action is kept up. Potilitzin (1887) remarked, however, that not only do
bromine and iodine displace the chlorine from chloric acid and potassium chlorate, but
also chlorine displaces bromine from sodium bromate, and, furthermore, the reaction does
not proceed as a direct substitution of the halogens, but is accompanied by the formation
of free acids; for example, 5NaClO<sub>3</sub> + 3Br<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 5NaBr + 5HClO<sub>3</sub> + HBrO<sub>3</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_81_710" id="Footnote_81_710"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_710"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> If iodine be stirred up in water, and chlorine passed through the mixture, the iodine
is dissolved; the liquid becomes colourless, and contains, according to the relative
amounts of water and chlorine, either IHCl<sub>2</sub>, or ICl<sub>3</sub>, or HIO<sub>3</sub>. If there be a small amount
of water, then the iodic acid may separate out directly as crystals, but a complete conversion
(Bornemann) only occurs when not less than ten parts of water are taken to
one part of iodine&mdash;ICl + 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 2Cl<sub>2</sub> = IHO<sub>3</sub> + 5HCl.</p></div>

oxidises iodine vapour, forming first of all the oxide I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, which is decomposed by water
or on heating into iodic anhydride and iodine. Iodic acid is formed at the positive pole
when a solution of hydriodic acid is decomposed by a galvanic current (Riche). It is
also formed in the combustion of hydrogen mixed with a small quantity of hydriodic acid
(Salet).</p></div>

is obtained by saturating a solution of lithia with iodic acid. There is an analogous
ammonium salt, 2(NH<sub>4</sub>IO<sub>3</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>O. He also obtained hydrates of a more complex composition,
such as 6(NH<sub>4</sub>IO<sub>3</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>O and 6(NH<sub>4</sub>IO<sub>3</sub>)2H<sub>2</sub>O. Salts of the alkaline earths,
Ba(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O and Sr(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>O, may be obtained by a reaction of double decomposition
from the normal salts of the type 2(MeIO<sub>3</sub>)H<sub>2</sub>O. When evaporated at 70° to 80° with
nitric acid these salts lose water. A mixture of solutions of nitrate of zinc and an
alkaline iodate precipitates Zn(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>2H<sub>2</sub>O. An anhydrous salt is thrown out if nitric
acid be added to the solutions. Analogous salts of cadmium, silver, and copper give
compounds of the type 2Me&#8242;IO<sub>3</sub>4NH<sub>3</sub> and Me&#8243;(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>4NH<sub>3</sub>, with gaseous ammonia (Me&#8242;

such as Zn(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O, Cd(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O. Copper gives Cu(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>4(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O and
Cu(IO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O. These salts may be regarded as compounds of I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and MeO and

which contains the corresponding compound of silver, Ag<sub>4</sub>I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O. If this sparingly

to the type IOX<sub>5</sub>, or IX<sub>7</sub>, like AgIO<sub>4</sub> which is IO<sub>3</sub>(OAg). The composition of all the
salts of periodic acids are expressed by this type IX<sub>7</sub>. Kimmins (1889) refers all
the salts of periodic acid to four types&mdash;the meta-salts of HIO<sub>4</sub> (salts of Ag, Cu, Pb),
the meso-salts of H<sub>3</sub>IO<sub>5</sub> (PbH, Ag<sub>2</sub>H, CdH), the para-salts of H<sub>5</sub>IO<sub>6</sub> (Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>, Na<sub>3</sub>H<sub>2</sub>), and
the di-salts of H<sub>4</sub>I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub> (K<sub>4</sub>, Ag<sub>4</sub>, Ni<sub>2</sub>). The three first are direct compounds of the type
IX<sub>7</sub>, namely, IO<sub>3</sub>(OH), IO<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub>, and IO(OH)<sub>5</sub>, and the last are types of diperiodic
salts, which correspond with the type of the meso-salts, as pyrophosphoric salts correspond
with orthophosphoric salts&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> 2H<sub>3</sub>IO<sub>5</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>4</sub>I<sub>2</sub>O<sub>9</sub>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_85_715" id="Footnote_85_715"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_715"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> Periodic acid, discovered by Magnus and Ammermüller, and whose salts were
afterwards studied by Langlois, Rammelsberg, and many others, presents an example of
hydrates in which it is evident that there is not that distinction between the water of
hydration and of crystallisation which was at first considered to be so clear. In HClO,2H<sub>2</sub>O
the water, 2H<sub>2</sub>O, is not displaced by bases, and must be regarded as water of crystallisation,
whilst in HIO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O it must be regarded as water of hydration. We shall afterwards
see that the system of the elements obliges us to consider the halogens as
substances giving a highest saline type, <i>GX</i><sub>7</sub>, where <i>G</i> signifies a halogen, and <i>X</i> oxygen
(O = <i>X</i><sub>2</sub>), OH, and other like elements. The hydrate IO(OH)<sub>5</sub> corresponding with many
of the salts of periodic acid (for example, the salts of barium, strontium, mercury) does
not exhaust all the possible forms. It is evident that various other pyro-, meta-, &amp;c., forms
are possible by the loss of water, as will be more fully explained in speaking of phosphoric
acid, and as was pointed out in the preceding note.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_86_716" id="Footnote_86_716"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_716"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> With respect to hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, and other elements, bromine occupies
an intermediate position between chlorine and iodine, and therefore there is no particular
need for considering at length the compounds of bromine. This is the great advantage

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_87_717" id="Footnote_87_717"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_717"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> They were both obtained by Gay-Lussac and many others. Recent data respecting
iodine monochloride, ICl, entirely confirm the numerous observations of Trapp
(1854), and even confirm his statement as to the existence of two isomeric (liquid and
crystalline) forms (Stortenbeker). With a small excess of iodine, iodine monochloride
remains liquid, but in the presence of traces of iodine trichloride it easily crystallises.
Tanatar (1893) showed that of the two modifications of ICl, one is stable, and melts at
27°; while the other, which easily passes into the first, and is formed in the absence of ICl<sub>3</sub>,
melts at 14°. Schützenberger amplified the data concerning the action of water on the
chlorides (Note <a href="#Footnote_88_718">88</a>), and Christomanos gave the fullest data regarding the trichloride.</p>

<p>After being kept for some time, the liquid monochloride of iodine yields red deliquescent
octahedra, having the composition ICl<sub>4</sub>, which are therefore formed from the monochloride
with the liberation of free iodine, which dissolves in the remaining quantity of the
monochloride. This substance, however, judging by certain observations, is impure iodine
trichloride. If 1 part of iodine be stirred up in 20 parts of water, and chlorine be passed
through the liquid, then all the iodine is dissolved, and a colourless liquid is ultimately
obtained which contains a certain proportion of chlorine, because this compound gives a
metallic chloride and iodate with alkalis without evolving any free iodine: ICl<sub>5</sub> + 6KHO
= 5KCl + KIO<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O. The existence of a pentachloride ICl<sub>5</sub> is, however, denied,
because this substance has not been obtained in a free state.</p>

<p>Stortenbeker (1888) investigated the equilibrium of the system containing the molecules
I<sub>2</sub>, ICl, ICl<sub>3</sub>, and Cl<sub>2</sub>, in the same way that Roozeboom (Chapter X. Note <a href="#Footnote_38_611">38</a>) examined
the equilibrium of the molecules HCl, HCl,2H<sub>2</sub>O, and H<sub>2</sub>O. He found that iodine
monochloride appears in two states, one (the ordinary) is stable and melts at 27°·2, whilst
the other is obtained by rapid cooling, and melts at 13°·9, and easily passes into the
first form. Iodine trichloride melts at 101° only in a closed tube under a pressure of 16
atmospheres.</p></div>

is obtained, which does not seem to be altered by water. Besides this compound, iodine
and iodic acid are always formed, 10ICl + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = HIO<sub>3</sub> + 5IHCl<sub>2</sub> + 2I<sub>2</sub>; and in this respect
iodine trichloride may be regarded as a mixture, ICl + ICl<sub>5</sub> = 2ICl<sub>3</sub>, but ICl<sub>5</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O

heated with common salt, in which case the sal-ammoniac is volatilised,
&amp;c. A similar decomposition also takes place when, for instance, a
mixture of lead sulphate and common salt is heated; this mixture
easily fuses, and if the temperature be further raised heavy vapours of
lead chloride appear. When the disengagement of these vapours ceases,
the remaining mass, on being treated with water, yields a solution of
sodium sulphate mixed with a solution of undecomposed common salt.
A considerable quantity, however, of the lead sulphate remains unchanged
during this reaction, PbSO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaCl = PbCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, the
vapours will contain lead chloride, and the residue will contain the mixture
of the three remaining salts. The cause and nature of the reaction
are just the same as were pointed out when considering the action of
sulphuric acid upon NaCl. Here too it may be shown that the double
decomposition is determined by the removal of PbCl<sub>2</sub> from the sphere of
the action of the remaining substances. This is seen from the fact that
sodium sulphate, on being dissolved in water and mixed with a solution
of any lead salt (and even with a solution of lead chloride, although
this latter is but sparingly soluble in water), immediately gives a white
precipitate of lead sulphate. In this case the lead takes up the
elements of sulphuric acid from the sodium sulphate in the solutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[514]</a></span>
On heating, the reverse phenomenon is observed. The reaction in the
solution depends upon the insolubility of the lead sulphate, and the
decomposition which takes place on heating is due to the volatility
of the lead chloride. Silver sulphate, Ag<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, in solution with common
salt, gives silver chloride, because the latter is insoluble in water,
Ag<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaCl = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2AgCl. Sodium carbonate, mixed in
solution with the sulphates of iron, copper, manganese, magnesium, &amp;c.,
gives in solution sodium sulphate, and in the precipitate a carbonate
of the corresponding metal, because these salts of carbonic acid
are insoluble in water; for instance, MgSO<sub>4</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
+ MgCO<sub>3</sub>. In precisely the same way sodium hydroxide acts on
solutions of the majority of the salts of sulphuric acid containing
metals, the hydroxides of which are insoluble in water&mdash;for instance,
CuSO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaHO = Cu(HO)<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Sulphate of magnesium,
MgSO<sub>4</sub>, on being mixed in solution with common salt, forms, although
not completely, chloride of magnesium, and sodium sulphate. On cooling
the mixture of such (concentrated) solutions sodium sulphate is
deposited, as was shown in Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>. This is made use of for preparing
it on the large scale in works where sea-water is treated. In this
case, on cooling, the reaction 2NaCl + MgSO<sub>4</sub> = MgCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
takes place.</p>

<p>Thus where sulphates and salts of sodium are in contact, it may
be expected that sodium sulphate will be formed and separated if
the conditions are favourable; for this reason it is not surprising
that sodium sulphate is often found in the native state. Some of the
springs and salt lakes in the steppes beyond the Volga, and in the
Caucasus, contain a considerable quantity of sodium sulphate, and yield
it by simple evaporation of the solutions. Beds of this salt are also
met with; thus at a depth of only 5 feet, about 38 versts to the
east of Tiflis, at the foot of the range of the &lsquo;Wolf's mane'&rsquo; (Voltchia
griva) mountains, a deep stratum of very pure Glauber's salt,
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, has been found.<a name="FNanchor_2_720" id="FNanchor_2_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_720" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> A layer two metres thick of the
same salt lies at the bottom of several lakes (an area of about 10
square kilometres) in the Kouban district near Batalpaschinsk, and
here its working has been commenced (1887). In Spain, near Arangoulz
and in many parts of the Western States of North America, mineral
sodium sulphate has likewise been found, and is already being worked.</p>

<p>The methods of obtaining salts by means of double decomposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[515]</a></span>
from others already prepared are so general, that in describing a given
salt there is no necessity to enumerate the cases hitherto observed of
its being formed through various double decompositions.<a name="FNanchor_3_721" id="FNanchor_3_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_721" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The possibility
of this occurrence ought to be foreseen according to Berthollet's
doctrine from the properties of the salt in question. On this account
it is important to know the properties of salts; all the more so because
up to the present time those very properties (solubility, formation of
crystallo-hydrates, volatility, &amp;c.) which may be made use of for separating
them from other salts have not been generalised.<a name="FNanchor_4_722" id="FNanchor_4_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_722" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> These properties
as yet remain subjects for investigation, and are rarely to
be foreseen. The crystallo-hydrate of the normal sodium sulphate,
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O, very easily parts with water, and may be obtained
in an anhydrous state if it be carefully heated until the weight remains
constant; but if heated further, it partly loses the elements of
sulphuric anhydride. The normal salt fuses at 843° (red heat), and
volatilises to a slight extent when very strongly heated, in which case it
naturally decomposes with the evolution of SO<sub>3</sub>. At 0° 100 parts of
water dissolve 5 parts of the anhydrous salt, at 10° 9 parts, at 20° 19·4,
at 30° 40, and at 34° 55 parts, the same being the case in the presence of
an excess of crystals of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_5_723" id="FNanchor_5_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_723" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> At 34° the latter fuses, and the
solubility decreases at higher temperatures.<a name="FNanchor_6_724" id="FNanchor_6_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_724" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A concentrated solution
at 34° has a composition nearly approaching to Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 14H<sub>2</sub>O,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[516]</a></span>
and the decahydrated salt contains 78·9 of the anhydrous salt combined
with 100 parts of water. From the above figures it is seen that
the decahydrated salt cannot fuse without decomposing,<a name="FNanchor_7_725" id="FNanchor_7_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_725" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> like hydrate of
chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O (Chapter XI., Note <a href="#Footnote_10_631">10</a>). Not only the fused decahydrated
salt, but also the concentrated solution at 34° (not all at once,
but gradually), yields the monohydrated salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. The heptahydrated
salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, also splits up, even at low temperatures,
with the formation of this monohydrated salt, and therefore from 35°
the solubility can be given only for the latter. For 100 parts of water
this is as follows: at 40° 48·8, at 50° 46·7, at 80° 43·7, at 100° 42·5
parts of the anhydrous salt. If the decahydrated salt be fused, and
the solution allowed to cool in the presence of the monohydrated
salt, then at 30° 50·4 parts of anhydrous salt are retained in the solution,
and at 20° 52·8 parts. Hence, with respect to the anhydrous and
monohydrated salts, the solubility is identical, and falls with increasing
temperature, whilst with respect to decahydrated salt, the solubility
rises with increasing temperature. So that if in contact with a solution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[517]</a></span>
of sodium sulphate there are only crystals of that heptahydrated salt
(Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_54_101">54</a>), Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, which is formed from saturated
solutions, then saturation sets in when the solution has the following
composition per 100 parts of salt: at 0° 19·6, at 10° 30·5, at 20°
44·7, and at 25° 52·9 parts of anhydrous salt. Above 27° the
heptahydrated salt, like the decahydrated salt at 34°, splits up
into the monohydrated salt and a saturated solution. Thus sodium
sulphate has three curves of solubility: one for Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O (from 0°
to 26°), one for Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O (from 0° to 34°), and one for
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O (a descending curve beginning at 26°), because there are
three of these crystallo-hydrates, and the solubility of a substance
only depends upon the particular condition of that portion of it which
has separated from the solution or is present in excess.<a name="FNanchor_8_726" id="FNanchor_8_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_726" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Thus solutions of sodium sulphate may give crystallo-hydrates of
three kinds on cooling the saturated solution: the unstable heptahydrated
salt is obtained at temperatures below 26°, the decahydrated
salt forms under ordinary conditions at temperatures below 34°, and
the monohydrated salt at temperatures above 34°. Both the latter
crystallo-hydrates present a stable state of equilibrium, and the heptahydrated
salt decomposes into them, probably according to the equation
3Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>0 = 2Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O + Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O. The ordinary
decahydrated salt is called <i>Glauber's salt</i>. All forms of these crystallo-hydrates
lose their water entirely, and give the anhydrous salt when
dried over sulphuric acid.<a name="FNanchor_9_727" id="FNanchor_9_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_727" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Sodium sulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, only enters into a few reactions of combination
with other salts, and chiefly with salts of the same acid,
forming double sulphates. Thus, for example, if a solution of sodium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[518]</a></span>
sulphate be mixed with a solution of aluminium, magnesium, or ferrous
sulphate, it gives crystals of a double salt when evaporated. Sulphuric
acid itself forms a compound with sodium sulphate, which is exactly
like these double salts. It is formed with great ease when sodium
sulphate is dissolved in sulphuric acid and the solution evaporated.
On evaporation, crystals of the acid salt separate, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
= 2NaHSO<sub>4</sub>. This separates from hot solutions, whilst the crystallo-hydrate,
NaHSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O,<a name="FNanchor_10_728" id="FNanchor_10_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_728" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> separates from cold solutions. The crystals
when exposed to damp air decompose into H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, which deliquesces,
and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (Graham, Rose); alcohol also extracts sulphuric acid from
the acid salt. This shows the feeble force which holds the sulphuric
acid to the sodium sulphate.<a name="FNanchor_11_729" id="FNanchor_11_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_729" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Both acid sodium sulphate and all
mixtures of the normal salt and sulphuric acid lose water when heated,
and are converted into sodium <i>pyrosulphate</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, at a low red
heat.<a name="FNanchor_11_BIS_730" id="FNanchor_11_BIS_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_BIS_730" class="fnanchor">[11 bis]</a> This anhydrous salt, at a bright red heat, parts with the
elements of sulphuric anhydride, the normal sodium sulphate remaining
behind&mdash;Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + SO<sub>3</sub>. From this it is seen that the
normal salt is able to combine with water, with other sulphates, and
with sulphuric anhydride or acid, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sodium sulphate may by double decomposition be converted into
a sodium salt of any other acid, by means of heat and taking advantage
of the volatility, or by means of solution and taking advantage of the
different degree of solubility of the different salts. Thus, for instance,
owing to the insolubility of barium sulphate, sodium hydroxide or
caustic soda may be prepared from sodium sulphate, if barium hydroxide
be added to its solution, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + Ba(HO)<sub>2</sub> = BaSO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaHO.
And by taking any salt of barium, BaX<sub>2</sub>, the corresponding salt of
sodium may be obtained, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + BaX<sub>2</sub> = BaSO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaX. Barium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[519]</a></span>
sulphate thus formed, being a very sparingly-soluble salt, is obtained as
a precipitate, whilst the sodium hydroxide, or salt, NaX, is obtained in
solution, because <i>all salts of sodium are soluble</i>. Berthollet's doctrine
permits all such cases to be foreseen.</p>

<p>The reactions of <i>decomposition</i> of sodium sulphate are above all
noticeable by the separation of oxygen. Sodium sulphate by itself is
very stable, and it is only at a temperature sufficient to melt iron that it
is possible to separate the elements SO<sub>3</sub> from it, and then only partially.
However, the oxygen may be separated from sodium sulphate, as from
all other sulphates, by means of many substances which are able to
combine with oxygen, such as charcoal and sulphur, but hydrogen is
not able to produce this action. If sodium sulphate be heated with
charcoal, then carbonic oxide and anhydride are evolved, and there is
produced, according to the circumstances, either the lower oxygen
compound, sodium sulphite, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (for instance, in the formation
of glass); or else the decomposition proceeds further, and sodium
sulphide, Na<sub>2</sub>S, is formed, according to the equation Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2C
= 2CO<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>S.</p>

<p>On the basis of this reaction the greater part of the sulphate of
sodium prepared at chemical works is converted into <i>soda ash</i>&mdash;that is,
<i>sodium carbonate</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, which is used for many purposes. In the
form of carbonates, the metallic oxides behave in many cases just as
they do in the state of oxides or hydroxides, owing to the feeble acid
properties of carbonic acid. However, the majority of the salts of
carbonic acid are insoluble, whilst sodium carbonate is one of the few
soluble salts of this acid, and therefore reacts with facility. Hence
sodium carbonate is employed for many purposes, in which its alkaline
properties come into play. Thus, even under the action of feeble
organic acids it immediately parts with its carbonic acid, and gives
a sodium salt of the acid taken. Its solutions exhibit an alkaline
reaction on litmus. It aids the passage of certain organic substances
(tar, acids) into solution, and is therefore used, like caustic alkalis and
soap (which latter also acts by virtue of the alkali it contains), for
the removal of certain organic substances, especially in bleaching
cotton and similar fabrics. Besides which a considerable quantity
of sodium carbonate is used for the preparation of sodium hydroxide
or caustic soda, which has also a very wide application. In large
chemical works where sodium carbonate is manufactured from Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,
it is usual first to manufacture sulphuric acid, and then by its aid to
convert common salt into sodium sulphate, and lastly to convert the
sodium sulphate thus obtained into carbonate and caustic soda. Hence
these works prepare both alkaline substances (soda ash and caustic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[520]</a></span>
soda) and acid substances (sulphuric and hydrochloric acids), the two
classes of chemical products which are distinguished for the greatest
energy of their reactions and are therefore most frequently applied
to technical purposes. Factories manufacturing soda are generally
called alkali works.</p>

<p>The process of the conversion of sodium sulphate into sodium
carbonate consists in strongly heating a mixture of the sulphate with
charcoal and calcium carbonate. The following reactions then take
place: the sodium sulphate is first deoxidised by the charcoal, forming
sodium sulphide and carbonic anhydride, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2C = Na<sub>2</sub>S + 2CO<sub>2</sub>.
The sodium sulphide thus formed then enters into double decomposition
with the calcium carbonate taken, and gives calcium sulphide and
sodium carbonate, Na<sub>2</sub>S + CaCO<sub>3</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + CaS.</p>

<p>Besides which, under the action of the heat, a portion of the excess
of calcium carbonate is decomposed into lime and carbonic anhydride,
CaCO<sub>3</sub> = CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>, and the carbonic anhydride with the excess of
charcoal forms carbon monoxide, which towards the end of the operation
shows itself by the appearance of a blue flame. Thus from a mass
containing sodium sulphate we obtain a mass which includes sodium
carbonate, calcium sulphide, and calcium oxide, but none of the sodium
sulphide which was formed on first heating the mixture. The entire
process, which proceeds at a high temperature, may be expressed by
a combination of the three above-mentioned formulæ, if it be considered
that the product contains one equivalent of calcium oxide to
two equivalents of calcium sulphide.<a name="FNanchor_12_731" id="FNanchor_12_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_731" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The sum of the reactions
may then be expressed thus: 2Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 3CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 9C = 2Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
+ CaO,2CaS + 10CO. Indeed, the quantities in which the substances
are mixed together at chemical works approaches to the proportion required
by this equation. The entire process of decomposition is carried
on in reverberatory furnaces, into which a mixture of 1,000 parts of
sodium sulphate, 1,040 parts of calcium carbonate (as a somewhat
porous limestone), and 500 parts of small coal is introduced from above.
This mixture is first heated in the portion of the furnace which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[521]</a></span>
furthest removed from the fire-grate; it is then brought to the portion
nearest to the fire-grate, when it is stirred during heating. The
partially fused mass obtained at the end of the process is cooled, and
then subjected to methodical lixiviation<a name="FNanchor_13_732" id="FNanchor_13_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_732" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> to extract the sodium carbonate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[522]</a></span>

&lsquo;soda waste&rsquo; or &lsquo;alkali waste.&rsquo;<a name="FNanchor_14_733" id="FNanchor_14_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_733" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[523]</a></span></p>

<p>The above-mentioned process for making soda was discovered in the
year 1808 by the French doctor Leblanc, and is known as the Leblanc
process. The particulars of the discovery are somewhat remarkable.
Sodium carbonate, having a considerable application in industry, was
for a long time prepared exclusively from the ash of marine plants
(Chapter XI., page <a href="#Page_497">497</a>). Even up to the present time this process is
carried on in Normandy. In France, where for a long time the manufacture
of large quantities of soap (so-called Marseilles soap) and various
fabrics required a large amount of soda, the quantity prepared at the
coast was insufficient to meet the demand. For this reason during
the wars at the beginning of the century, when the import of foreign
goods into France was interdicted, the want of sodium carbonate was felt.
The French Academy offered a prize for the discovery of a profitable
method of preparing it from common salt. Leblanc then proposed the
above-mentioned process, which is remarkable for its great simplicity.<a name="FNanchor_15_734" id="FNanchor_15_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_734" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[524]</a></span></p>

<p>Of all other industrial processes for manufacturing sodium carbonate,
the <i>ammonia process</i> is the most worthy of mention.<a name="FNanchor_16_735" id="FNanchor_16_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_735" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> In this the
vapours of ammonia, and then an excess of carbonic anhydride, are
directly introduced into a concentrated solution of sodium chloride in
order to form the acid ammonium carbonate, NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>. Then, by
means of the double saline decomposition of this salt, sodium chloride is
decomposed, and in virtue of its slight solubility acid sodium carbonate,
NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, is precipitated and ammonium chloride, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, is obtained
in solution (with a portion of the sodium chloride and acid sodium
carbonate). The reaction proceeds in the solution owing to the sparing
solubility of the NaHCO<sub>3</sub> according to the equation NaCl + NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>
= NH<sub>4</sub>Cl + NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. The ammonia is recovered from the solution
by heating with lime or magnesia,<a name="FNanchor_16_BIS_736" id="FNanchor_16_BIS_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_BIS_736" class="fnanchor">[16 bis]</a> and the precipitated acid sodium
carbonate is converted into the normal salt by heating. It is thus
obtained in a very pure state.<a name="FNanchor_17_737" id="FNanchor_17_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_737" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[525]</a></span></p>

<p>Sodium carbonate, like sodium sulphate, loses all its water on
being heated, and when anhydrous fuses at a bright-red heat (1098°).
A small quantity of sodium carbonate placed in the loop of a platinum
wire volatilises in the heat of a gas flame, and therefore in the furnaces
of glass works part of the soda is always transformed into the condition
of vapour. Sodium carbonate resembles sodium sulphate in its relation
to water.<a name="FNanchor_18_738" id="FNanchor_18_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_738" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Here also the greatest solubility is at the temperature of
37°; both salts, on crystallising at the ordinary temperature, combine
with ten molecules of water, and such crystals of soda, like crystals of
Glauber's salt, fuse at 34°. Sodium carbonate also forms a supersaturated
solution, and, according to the conditions, gives various combinations
with water of crystallisation (mentioned on page <a href="#Page_108">108</a>), &amp;c.</p>

<p>At a red heat superheated steam liberates carbonic anhydride from
sodium carbonate and forms caustic soda, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2NaHO
+ CO<sub>2</sub>. Here the carbonic anhydride is replaced by water; this depends
on the feebly acid character of carbonic anhydride. By direct heating,
sodium carbonate is only slightly decomposed into sodium oxide and
carbonic anhydride; thus, when sodium carbonate is fused, about
1 per cent. of carbonic anhydride is disengaged.<a name="FNanchor_19_739" id="FNanchor_19_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_739" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The carbonates of
many other metals&mdash;for instance, of calcium, copper, magnesium, iron,
&amp;c.&mdash;on being heated lose all their carbonic anhydride. This shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[526]</a></span>
the considerable basic energy which sodium possesses. With the
soluble salts of most metals, sodium carbonate gives precipitates
either of insoluble carbonates of the metals, or else of the hydroxides
(in this latter case carbonic anhydride is disengaged); for instance,
with barium salts it precipitates an insoluble barium carbonate
(BaCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = 2NaCl + BaCO<sub>3</sub>) and with the aluminium
salts it precipitates aluminium hydroxide, carbonic anhydride being
disengaged: 3Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Al<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O = 3Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 2Al(OH)<sub>3</sub>
+ 3CO<sub>2</sub>. Sodium carbonate, like all the salts of carbonic acid, evolves
carbonic anhydride on treatment with all acids which are to any extent
energetic. But if an acid diluted with water be gradually added to a
solution of sodium carbonate, <i>at first</i> such an evolution does not take
place, because the excess of the carbonic anhydride forms acid sodium
carbonate (sodium bicarbonate), NaHCO<sub>3</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_20_740" id="FNanchor_20_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_740" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The acid sodium
carbonate is an unstable salt. Not only when heated alone, but even
on being slightly heated in solution, and also at the ordinary
temperature in damp air, it loses carbonic anhydride and forms the
normal salt. And at the same time it is easy to obtain it in a pure
crystalline form, if a strong solution of sodium carbonate be cooled and
a stream of carbonic anhydride gas passed through it. The acid salt
is less soluble in water than the normal,<a name="FNanchor_21_741" id="FNanchor_21_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_741" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and therefore a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[527]</a></span>
solution of the latter gives crystals of the acid salt if carbonic
anhydride be passed through it. The acid salt may be yet more
conveniently formed from effloresced crystals of sodium carbonate,
which, on being considerably heated, very easily absorb carbonic anhydride.<a name="FNanchor_22_742" id="FNanchor_22_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_742" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
The acid salt crystallises well, but not, however, in such large
crystals as the normal salt; it has a brackish and not an alkaline taste
like that of the normal salt; its reaction is feebly alkaline, nearly neutral.
At 70° its solution begins to lose carbonic anhydride, and on boiling the
evolution becomes very abundant. From the preceding remarks it is
clear that in most reactions this salt, especially when heated, acts
similarly to the normal salt, but has, naturally, some distinction from
it. Thus, for example, if a solution of sodium carbonate be added to a
normal magnesium salt, a turbidity (precipitate) is formed of magnesium
carbonate. MgCO<sub>3</sub>. No such precipitate is formed by the acid salt,
because magnesium carbonate is soluble in the presence of an excess of
carbonic anhydride.</p>

<p>Sodium carbonate is used for the preparation of <i>caustic soda</i><a name="FNanchor_23_743" id="FNanchor_23_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_743" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;that
is, the hydrate of sodium oxide, or the alkali which corresponds
to sodium. For this purpose the action of lime on a solution of
sodium carbonate is generally made use of. The process is as follows:
a weak, generally 10 per cent., solution of sodium carbonate is taken,<a name="FNanchor_24_744" id="FNanchor_24_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_744" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[528]</a></span>
and boiled in a cast-iron, wrought-iron, or silver boiler (sodium hydroxide
does not act on these metals), and lime is added, little by little,
during the boiling. This latter is soluble in water, although but very
slightly. The clear solution becomes turbid on the addition of the lime
because a precipitate is formed; this precipitate consists of calcium
carbonate, almost insoluble in water, whilst caustic soda is formed and
remains in solution. The decomposition is effected according to the
equation: Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(HO)<sub>2</sub> = CaCO<sub>3</sub> + 2NaHO. On cooling the
solution the calcium carbonate easily settles as a precipitate, and the
clear solution or alkali above it contains the easily soluble sodium
hydroxide formed in the reaction.<a name="FNanchor_25_745" id="FNanchor_25_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_745" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> After the necessary quantity of
lime has been added, the solution is allowed to stand, and is then
decanted off and evaporated in cast or wrought iron boilers, or in silver
pans if a perfectly pure product is required.<a name="FNanchor_26_746" id="FNanchor_26_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_746" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The evaporation cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[529]</a></span>
be conducted in china, glass, or similar vessels, because caustic soda
attacks these materials, although but slightly. The solution does not
crystallise on evaporation, because the solubility of caustic soda when
hot is very great, but crystals containing water of crystallisation may
be obtained by cooling. If the evaporation of the alkali be conducted
until the specific gravity reaches 1·38, and the liquid is then cooled
to 0°, transparent crystals appear containing 2NaHO,7H<sub>2</sub>O; they
fuse at +6°.<a name="FNanchor_27_747" id="FNanchor_27_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_747" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> If the evaporation be conducted so long as water is disengaged,
which requires a considerable amount of heat, then, on cooling,
the hydroxide, NaHO, solidifies in a semi-transparent crystalline mass,<a name="FNanchor_28_748" id="FNanchor_28_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_748" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
which eagerly absorbs moisture and carbonic anhydride from the air.<a name="FNanchor_29_749" id="FNanchor_29_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_749" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Its specific gravity is 2·13;<a name="FNanchor_30_750" id="FNanchor_30_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_750" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> it is easily soluble in water, with disengagement
of a considerable quantity of heat.<a name="FNanchor_31_751" id="FNanchor_31_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_751" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> A saturated solution
at the ordinary temperature has a specific gravity of about 1·5, contains
about 45 per cent. of sodium hydroxide, and boils at 130°; at 55° water
dissolves an equal weight of it.<a name="FNanchor_32_752" id="FNanchor_32_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_752" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Caustic soda is not only soluble in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[530]</a></span>
water but in alcohol, and even in ether. Dilute solutions of sodium
hydroxide produce a soapy feeling on the skin because the active base
of soap consists of caustic soda.<a name="FNanchor_33_753" id="FNanchor_33_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_753" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Strong solutions have a corroding
action.</p>

<p>The chemical <i>reactions of sodium hydroxide</i> serve as a type for those
of a whole class of alkalis&mdash;that is, of soluble basic hydroxides, MOH.
The solution of sodium hydroxide is a very caustic liquid&mdash;that is to say,
it acts in a destructive way on most substances, for instance on most
organic tissues&mdash;hence caustic soda, like all soluble alkalis, is a poisonous
substance; acids, for example hydrochloric, serve as antidotes.
The action of caustic soda on bones, fat, starch, and similar vegetable
and animal substances explains its action on organisms. Thus bones,
when plunged into a weak solution of caustic soda, fall to powder,<a name="FNanchor_34_754" id="FNanchor_34_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_754" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[531]</a></span>
and evolve a smell of ammonia, owing to the caustic soda changing
the gelatinous organic substance of the bones (which contains carbon,
hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulphur, like albumin), dissolving it
and in part destroying it, whence ammonia is disengaged. Fats, tallow,
and oils become saponified by a solution of caustic soda&mdash;that is to
say, they form with it <i>soaps</i> soluble in water, or sodium salts of the
organic acids contained in the fats.<a name="FNanchor_35_755" id="FNanchor_35_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_755" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> The most characteristic reactions
of sodium hydroxide are determined by the fact that it <i>saturates all
acids, forming salts with them</i>, which are almost all soluble in water, and
in this respect caustic soda is as characteristic amongst the bases as
nitric acid is among the acids. It is impossible to detect sodium by
means of the formation of precipitates of insoluble sodium salts, as may
be done with other metals, many of whose salts are but slightly soluble.
The powerful alkaline properties of caustic soda determine its capacity
for combining with even the feeblest acids, its property of disengaging
ammonia from ammonium salts, its faculty of forming precipitates from
solutions of salts whose bases are insoluble in water, &amp;c. If a solution
of the salt of almost any metal be mixed with caustic soda, then a
soluble sodium salt will be formed, and an insoluble hydroxide of the
metal will be separated&mdash;for instance, copper nitrate yields copper
hydroxide, Cu(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2NaHO = Cu(HO)<sub>2</sub> + 2NaNO<sub>3</sub>. Even many
<i>basic oxides</i> precipitated by caustic soda <i>are capable</i> of <i>combining</i> with
it and forming soluble compounds, and therefore caustic soda in the
presence of salts of such metals first forms a precipitate of hydroxide,
and then, employed in excess, dissolves this precipitate. This phenomenon
occurs, for example, when caustic soda is added to the salts of
aluminium. This shows the property of such an alkali as caustic soda
of combining not only with acids, but also with feeble basic oxides. For
this reason caustic soda <i>acts on most elements</i> which are capable of forming
acids or oxides similar to them; thus the metal aluminium gives
hydrogen with caustic soda in consequence of the formation of alumina,
which combines with the caustic soda&mdash;that is, in this case, the caustic
alkali acts on the metal just as sulphuric acid does on Fe or Zn. If
caustic soda acts in this manner on a metalloid capable of combining
with the hydrogen evolved (aluminium does not give a compound with
hydrogen), then it forms such a hydrogen compound. Thus, for instance,
phosphorus acts in this way on caustic soda, yielding hydrogen phosphide.
When the hydrogen compound disengaged is capable of combining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span>
with the alkali, then, naturally, a salt of the corresponding acid is
formed. For example, chlorine and sulphur act in this way on caustic
soda. Chlorine, with the hydrogen of the caustic soda, forms hydrochloric
acid, and the latter forms common salt with the sodium hydroxide,
whilst the other atom in the molecule of chlorine, Cl<sub>2</sub>, takes the place
of the hydrogen, and forms the hypochlorite, NaClO. In the same way,
by the action of sodium hydroxide on sulphur, hydrogen sulphide is
formed, which acts on the soda forming sodium <i>sulphide</i>, in addition to
which sodium thiosulphate is formed (<i>see</i> Chapter XX.) By virtue of
such reactions, sodium hydroxide acts on many metals and non-metals.
Such action is often accelerated by the presence of the oxygen of the
air, as by this means the formation of acids and oxides rich in oxygen
is facilitated. Thus many metals and their lower oxides, in the presence
of an alkali, absorb oxygen and form acids. Even manganese peroxide,
when mixed with caustic soda, is capable of absorbing the oxygen of
the air, and forming sodium manganate. Organic acids when heated
with caustic soda give up to it the elements of carbonic anhydride,
forming sodium carbonate, and separating that hydrocarbon group
which exists, in combination with carbonic anhydride, in the organic
acid.</p>

<p>Thus sodium hydroxide, like the soluble alkalis in general, ranks
amongst the most active substances in the chemical sense of the term,
and but few substances are capable of resisting it. Even siliceous rocks,
as we shall see further on, are transformed by it, forming when fused
with it vitreous slags. Sodium hydroxide (like ammonium and potassium
hydroxides), as a typical example of the basic hydrates, in distinction
from many other basic oxides, easily <i>forms acid salts</i> with acids (for
instance, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), and does not form any basic salts at
all; whilst many less energetic bases, such as the oxides of copper
and lead, easily form basic salts, but acid salts only with difficulty.
This capability of forming acid salts, particularly with polybasic
acids, may be explained by the energetic basic properties of sodium
hydroxide, contrasted with the small development of these properties
in the bases which easily form basic salts. An energetic base is
capable of retaining a considerable quantity of acid, which a slightly
energetic base would not have the power of doing. Also, as will be
shown in the subsequent chapters, sodium belongs to the univalent
metals, being exchangeable for hydrogen atom for atom&mdash;that is,
amongst metals sodium may, like chlorine amongst the non-metals, serve
as the representative of the univalent properties. Most of the elements
which are not capable of forming acid salts are bivalent. Whence
it may be understood that in a bibasic acid&mdash;for instance, carbonic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>
H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, or sulphuric, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;the hydrogen may be exchanged, atom
for atom, for sodium, and yield an acid salt by means of the first
substitution, and a normal salt by means of the second&mdash;for instance,
NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, whilst such bivalent metals as calcium and
barium do not form acid salts because one of their atoms at once
takes the place of both hydrogen atoms, forming, for example, CaCO<sub>3</sub>
and CaSO<sub>4</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_35_BIS_756" id="FNanchor_35_BIS_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_BIS_756" class="fnanchor">[35 bis]</a></p>

<p>We have seen the transformation of common salt into sodium
sulphate, of this latter into sodium carbonate, and of sodium carbonate
into caustic soda. Lavoisier still regarded sodium hydroxide as an
element, because he was unacquainted with its decomposition with the
formation of metallic sodium, which separates the hydrogen from water,
reforming caustic soda.</p>

<p>The preparation of <i>metallic sodium</i> was one of the greatest discoveries
in chemistry, not only because through it the conception of
elements became broader and more correct, but especially because in
sodium, chemical properties were observed which were but feebly shown
in the other metals more familiarly known. This discovery was made
in 1807 by the English chemist <i>Davy</i> by means of the galvanic
current. By connecting with the positive pole (of copper or carbon)
a piece of caustic soda (moistened in order to obtain electrical conductivity),
and boring a hole in it filled with mercury connected with
the negative pole of a strong Volta's pile, Davy observed that on passing
the current a peculiar metal dissolved in the mercury, less volatile
than mercury, and capable of decomposing water, again forming
caustic soda. In this way (by analysis and synthesis) Davy demonstrated
the compound nature of alkalis. On being decomposed by the
galvanic current, caustic soda disengages hydrogen and sodium at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span>
negative pole and oxygen at the positive pole. Davy showed that the
metal formed volatilises at a red heat, and this is its most important
physical property in relation to its extraction, all later methods being
founded on it. Besides this Davy observed that sodium easily oxidises,
its vapour taking fire in air, and the latter circumstance was for a
long time an obstacle to the easy preparation of this metal. The
properties of sodium were subsequently more thoroughly investigated
by Gay-Lussac and Thénard, who observed that metallic iron at a high
temperature was capable of reducing caustic soda to sodium.<a name="FNanchor_36_757" id="FNanchor_36_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_757" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Brunner
latterly discovered that not only iron, but also charcoal, has this
property, although hydrogen has not.<a name="FNanchor_37_758" id="FNanchor_37_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_758" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> But still the methods of extracting
sodium were very troublesome, and consequently it was a great
rarity. The principal obstacle to its production was that an endeavour
was made to condense the easily-oxidising vapours of sodium in vacuo
in complicated apparatus. For this reason, when Donny and Maresca,
having thoroughly studied the matter, constructed a specially simple
condenser, the production of sodium was much facilitated. Furthermore,
in practice the most important epoch in the history of the
production of sodium is comprised in the investigation of Sainte-Claire
Deville, who avoided the complex methods in vogue up to that time,
and furnished those simple means by which the production of sodium is
now rendered feasible in chemical works.</p>

<p>For the production of sodium according to Deville's method, a
mixture of anhydrous sodium carbonate (7 parts), charcoal (two parts),
and lime or chalk (7 parts) is heated. This latter ingredient is only
added in order that the sodium carbonate, on fusing, shall not separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>
from the charcoal.<a name="FNanchor_38_759" id="FNanchor_38_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_759" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The chalk on being heated loses carbonic anhydride,
leaving infusible lime, which is permeated by the sodium
carbonate and forms a thick mass, in which the charcoal is intimately
mixed with the sodium carbonate. When the charcoal is heated with
the sodium carbonate, at a white heat, carbonic oxide and vapours of
sodium are disengaged, according to the equation:</p>

<p class="title">Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 2C = Na<sub>2</sub> + 3CO</p>

<p>On cooling the vapours and gases disengaged, the vapours condense
into molten metal (in this form sodium does not easily oxidise, whilst
in vapour it burns) and the carbonic oxide remains as gas.</p>

sodium condenser, consisting
of two cast-iron plates
screwed together.</p></div>

<p>In sodium works an iron tube, about a metre long and a decimeter
in diameter, is made out of boiler plate. The pipe is luted into a
furnace having a strong draught, capable of giving a high temperature,
and the tube is charged with the mixture required for the preparation
of sodium. One end of the tube is closed with a cast-iron stopper A
with clay luting, and the other with the cast-iron stopper C provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[536]</a></span>
with an aperture. On heating, first of all the moisture contained in
the various substances is given off, then carbonic anhydride and the
products of the dry distillation of the charcoal, then the latter begins
to act on the sodium carbonate, and carbonic
oxide and vapours of sodium appear. It is easy
to observe the appearance of the latter, because
on issuing from the aperture in the stopper C
they take fire spontaneously and burn with a
very bright yellow flame. A pipe is then introduced
into the aperture C, compelling the
vapours and gases formed to pass through the
condenser B. This condenser consists of two
square cast-iron trays, A and A&#8242;, fig. <a href="#fig_71">71</a>, with
wide edges firmly screwed together. Between
these two trays there is a space in which the condensation of the
vapours of sodium is effected, the thin metallic walls of the condenser
being cooled by the air but remaining hot enough to preserve the
sodium in a liquid state, so that it does not choke the apparatus, but
continually flows from it. The vapours of sodium, condensing in the
cooler, flow in the shape of liquid metal into a vessel containing some
non-volatile naphtha or hydrocarbon. This is used in order to prevent
the sodium oxidising as it issues from the condenser at a somewhat
high temperature. In order to obtain sodium of a pure quality it is
necessary to distil it once more, which may even be done in porcelain
retorts, but the distillation must be conducted in a stream of some gas
on which sodium does not act, for instance in a stream of nitrogen;
carbonic anhydride is not applicable, because sodium partially decomposes
it, absorbing oxygen from it. Although the above described
methods of preparing sodium by chemical means have proved very convenient
in practice, still it is now (since 1893) found profitable in
England to obtain it (to the amount of several tons a week) by Davy's
classical method, <i>i.e.</i> by the action of an electric current at a moderately
high temperature, because the means for producing an electric current
(by motors and dynamos) now render this quite feasible. This may be
regarded as a sign that in process of time many other technical methods
for producing various substances by <i>decomposition</i> may be profitably
carried on by electrolysis.</p>

<p>Pure sodium is a lustrous metal, white as silver, soft as wax; it
becomes brittle in the cold. In ordinary moist air it quickly tarnishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[537]</a></span>
and becomes covered with a film of hydroxide, NaHO, formed at the
expense of the water in the air. In perfectly dry air sodium retains
its lustre for an indefinite time. Its density at the ordinary temperature
is equal to 0·98, so that it is lighter than water; it fuses very
easily at a temperature of 95°, and distils at a bright red heat (742°
according to Perman, 1889). Scott (1887) determined the density of
sodium vapour and found it to be nearly 12 (if H = 1). This shows that
its molecule contains one atom (like mercury and cadmium) Na.<a name="FNanchor_38_BIS_760" id="FNanchor_38_BIS_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_BIS_760" class="fnanchor">[38 bis]</a> It
forms alloys with most metals, combining with them, heat being sometimes
evolved and sometimes absorbed. Thus, if sodium (having a clean
surface) be thrown into mercury, especially when heated, there is a flash,
and such a considerable amount of heat is evolved that part of the
mercury is transformed into vapour.<a name="FNanchor_39_761" id="FNanchor_39_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_761" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Compounds or solutions of
sodium in mercury, or <i>amalgams</i> of sodium, even when containing
2 parts of sodium to 100 parts of mercury, are solids. Only those
amalgams which are the very poorest in sodium are liquid. Such alloys
of sodium with mercury are often used instead of sodium in chemical
investigations, because in combination with mercury sodium is not
easily acted on by air, and is heavier than water, and therefore more
convenient to handle, whilst at the same time it retains the principal
properties of sodium,<a name="FNanchor_40_762" id="FNanchor_40_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_762" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> for instance it decomposes water, forming
NaHO.</p>

<p>It is easy to form an alloy of mercury and sodium having a crystalline
structure, and a definite atomic composition, NaHg<sub>5</sub>. The alloy of
sodium with hydrogen or <i>sodium hydride</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>H, which has the external<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[538]</a></span>
appearance of a metal,<a name="FNanchor_41_763" id="FNanchor_41_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_763" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> is a most instructive example of the characteristics
of alloys. At the ordinary temperature sodium does not absorb
hydrogen, but from 300° to 421° the absorption takes place at the
ordinary pressure (and at an increased pressure even at higher temperatures),
as shown by Troost and Hautefeuille (1874). One volume
of sodium absorbs as much as 238 volumes of hydrogen. The metal
increases in volume, and when once formed the alloy can be preserved
for some time without change at the ordinary temperature. The
appearance of sodium hydride resembles that of sodium itself; it is
as soft as this latter, when heated it becomes brittle, and decomposes
above 300°, evolving hydrogen. In this decomposition all the phenomena
of dissociation are very clearly shown&mdash;that is, the hydrogen
gas evolved has a definite tension<a name="FNanchor_42_764" id="FNanchor_42_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_764" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> corresponding with each definite
temperature. This confirms the fact that the formation of substances
capable of dissociation can only be accomplished within the dissociation
limits. Sodium hydride melts more easily than sodium itself, and then
does not undergo decomposition if it is in an atmosphere of hydrogen.
It oxidises easily in air, but not so easily as potassium hydride. The
chemical reactions of sodium are retained in its hydride, and, if we may
so express it, they are even increased by the addition of hydrogen. At
all events, in the properties of sodium hydride<a name="FNanchor_43_765" id="FNanchor_43_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_765" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> we see other properties
than in such hydrogen compounds as HCl, H<sub>2</sub>O, H<sub>3</sub>N, H<sub>4</sub>C, or even
in the gaseous metallic hydrides AsH<sub>3</sub>, TeH<sub>2</sub>. Platinum, palladium,
nickel, and iron, in absorbing hydrogen form compounds in which
hydrogen is in a similar state. In them, as in sodium hydride, the
hydrogen is compressed, absorbed, occluded (Chapter <a href="#Page_113">II</a>.)<a name="FNanchor_43_BIS_766" id="FNanchor_43_BIS_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_BIS_766" class="fnanchor">[43 bis]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[539]</a></span></p>

<p>The most important chemical property of sodium is its power of
easily decomposing water and <i>evolving hydrogen</i> from the majority of
the hydrogen compounds, and especially from all acids, and hydrates
in which hydroxyl must be recognised. This depends on its power of
combining with the elements which are in combination with the
hydrogen. We already know that sodium disengages hydrogen, not
only from water, hydrochloric acid,<a name="FNanchor_44_767" id="FNanchor_44_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_767" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and all other acids, but also from
ammonia,<a name="FNanchor_44_BIS_768" id="FNanchor_44_BIS_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_BIS_768" class="fnanchor">[44 bis]</a> with the formation of sodamide NH<sub>2</sub>Na, although it
does not displace hydrogen from the hydrocarbons.<a name="FNanchor_45_769" id="FNanchor_45_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_769" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Sodium burns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[540]</a></span>
both in chlorine and in oxygen, evolving much heat. These properties
are closely connected with its power of taking up oxygen, chlorine,
and similar elements from most of their compounds. Just as it removes
the oxygen from the oxides of nitrogen and from carbonic anhydride, so
also does it decompose the majority of oxides at definite temperatures.
Here the action is essentially the same as in the decomposition of
water. Thus, for instance, when acting on magnesium chloride the
sodium displaces the magnesium, and when acting on aluminium chloride
it displaces metallic aluminium. Sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic and a
whole series of other elements, also combine with sodium.<a name="FNanchor_46_770" id="FNanchor_46_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_770" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>With <i>oxygen</i> sodium unites in three degrees of combination, forming
a suboxide Na<sub>4</sub>O,<a name="FNanchor_46_BIS_771" id="FNanchor_46_BIS_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_BIS_771" class="fnanchor">[46 bis]</a> an oxide, Na<sub>2</sub>O, and a peroxide, NaO. They are
thus termed because Na<sub>2</sub>O is a stable basic oxide (with water it forms
a basic hydroxide), whilst Na<sub>4</sub>O and NaO do not form corresponding
saline hydrates and salts. The suboxide is a grey inflammable substance
which easily decomposes water, disengaging hydrogen; it is formed
by the slow oxidation of sodium at the ordinary temperature. The
peroxide is a greenish yellow substance, fusing at a bright red heat; it
is produced by burning sodium in an excess of oxygen, and it yields
oxygen when treated with water:</p>

<p>All three oxides form sodium hydroxide with water, but only the
oxide Na<sub>2</sub>O is directly transformed into a hydrate. The other oxides
liberate either hydrogen or oxygen; they also present a similar distinction
with reference to many other agents. Thus carbonic anhydride
combines directly with the oxide Na<sub>2</sub>O, which when heated in the gas
burns, forming sodium carbonate, whilst the peroxide yields oxygen in
addition. When treated with acids, sodium and all its oxides only
form the salts corresponding with sodium oxide&mdash;that is, of the formula or
type NaX. Thus the oxide of sodium, Na<sub>2</sub>O, is <i>the only salt-forming</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[542]</a></span>
<i>oxide</i> of this metal, as water is in the case of hydrogen. Although the
peroxide H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is derived from hydrogen, and Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from sodium,
yet there are no corresponding salts known, and if they are formed
they are probably as unstable as hydrogen peroxide. Although carbon
forms carbonic oxide, CO, still it has only one salt-forming oxide&mdash;carbonic
anhydride, CO<sub>2</sub>. Nitrogen and chlorine both give several
salt-forming oxides and types of salts. But of the oxides of nitrogen,
NO and NO<sub>2</sub> do not form salts, as do N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, although
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> does not form special salts, and N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> corresponds with the
highest form of the saline compounds of nitrogen. Such distinctions
between the elements, according to their power of giving one or several
saline forms, is a radical property of no less importance than the basic
or acid properties of their oxides. Sodium as a typical metal does
not form any acid oxides, whilst chlorine, as a typical non-metal, does
not form bases with oxygen. Therefore sodium <i>as an element</i> may be
thus characterised: it forms one very stable salt-forming oxide, Na<sub>2</sub>O,
having powerful basic properties, and its salts are of the general
formula, NaX, therefore in its compounds it is, like hydrogen, a basic
and univalent element.</p>

<p>On comparing sodium and its analogues, which will be described later
with other metallic elements, it will be seen that these properties,
together with the relative lightness of the metal itself and its compounds,
and the magnitude of its atomic weight comprise the most
essential properties of this element, clearly distinguishing it from
others, and enabling us easily to recognise its analogues.</p>

also by many other combinations. Thus sodium sulphate may be formed from sodium
oxide and sulphuric anhydride, by oxidising sodium sulphide, Na<sub>2</sub>S, or sodium sulphite,
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. When sodium chloride is heated in a mixture of the vapours of water, air,
and sulphurous anhydride, sodium sulphate is formed. According to this method (patented
by Hargreaves and Robinson), sodium sulphate, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, is obtained from NaCl without the
preliminary manufacture of H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. Lumps of NaCl pressed into bricks are loosely packed
into a cylinder and subjected, at a red heat, to the action of steam, air and SO<sub>2</sub>. Under
these conditions, HCl, sulphate, and a certain amount of unaltered NaCl are obtained.
This mixture is converted into soda by Gossage's process (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_15_734">15</a>) and may have

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_722" id="Footnote_4_722"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_722"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Many observations have been made, but little general information has been obtained
from particular cases. In addition to which, the properties of a given salt are changed
by the presence of other salts. This takes place not only in virtue of mutual decomposition
or formation of double salts capable of separate existence, but is determined by the
influence which some salts exert on others, or by forces similar to those which act during
solution. Here nothing has been generalised to that extent which would render it
possible to predict without previous investigation, if there be no close analogy to help
us. Let us state one of these numerous cases: 100 parts of water at 20° dissolve
34 parts of potassium nitrate but on the addition of sodium nitrate the solubility of
potassium nitrate increases to 48 parts in 10 of water (Carnelley and Thomson). In
general, in all cases of which there are accurate observations it appears that the
presence of foreign salts changes the properties of any given salt.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_723" id="Footnote_5_723"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_723"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The information concerning solubility (Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.) is given according to the determinations

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_724" id="Footnote_6_724"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_724"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> In Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_24_71">24</a>, we have already seen that with many other sulphates the
solubility also decreases after a certain temperature is passed. Gypsum, CaSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, lime,
and many other compounds present such a phenomenon. An observation of Tilden's (1884)
is most instructive; he showed that on raising the temperature (in closed vessels) above
140° the solubility of sodium sulphate again begins to increase. At 100° 100 parts of
water dissolve about 43 parts of anhydrous salt, at 140° 42 parts, at 160° 43 parts, at
180° 44 parts, at 230° 46 parts. According to Étard (1892) the solubility of 30 parts of
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> in 100 of solution (or 43 per 100 of water) corresponds to 80°, and above 240° the
solubility again falls, and very rapidly, so that at 320° the solution contains 12 per 100 of
solution (about 14 per 100 of water) and a further rise of temperature is followed by a
further deposition of the salt. It is evident that the phenomenon of saturation, determined
by the presence of an excess of the dissolved substance, is very complex, and
therefore that for the theory of solutions considered as liquid indefinite chemical compounds,
many useful statements can hardly be given.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_725" id="Footnote_7_725"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_725"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Already referred to in Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_56_103">56</a>.</p>

<p>The example of sodium sulphate is historically very important for the theory of solutions.
Notwithstanding the number of investigations which have been made, it is still
insufficiently studied, especially from the point of the vapour tension of solutions and
crystallo-hydrates, so that those processes cannot be applied to it which Guldberg,
Roozeboom, Van't Hoff, and others applied to solutions and crystallo-hydrates. It would
also be most important to investigate the influence of pressure on the various phenomena
corresponding with the combinations of water and sodium sulphate, because when crystals
are separated&mdash;for instance, of the decahydrated salt&mdash;an increase of volume takes place,
as can be seen from the following data:&mdash;the sp. gr. of the anhydrous salt is 2·66, that
of the decahydrated salt = 1·46, but the sp. gr. of solutions at 15°/4° = 9,992 + 90·2<i>p</i> + 0·35<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>
where p represents the percentage of anhydrous salt in the solution, and the sp. gr. of
water at 4° = 10,000. Hence for solutions containing 20 p.c. of anhydrous salt the sp. gr.
= 1·1936; therefore the volume of 100 grams of this solution = 83·8 c.c., and the volume of
anhydrous salt contained in it is equal to 20/2·66, or = 7·5 c.c., and the volume of water
= 80·1 c.c. Therefore, the solution, on decomposing into anhydrous salt and water,
increases in volume (from 83·8 to 87·6); but in the same way 83·8 c.c. of 20 p.c. solution
are formed from (45·4/1·46 =) 31·1 c.c. of the decahydrated salt, and 54·6 c.c. of water&mdash;that
is to say, that during the formation of a solution from 85·7 c.c., 83·8 c.c. are formed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_726" id="Footnote_8_726"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_726"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> From this example it is evident the solution remains unaltered until from the
contact of a solid it becomes either saturated or supersaturated, crystallisation being
determined by the attraction to a solid, as the phenomenon of supersaturation clearly
demonstrates. This partially explains certain apparently contradictory determinations
of solubility. The best investigated example of such complex relations is cited in
Chapter XIV., Note <a href="#Footnote_50_879">50</a> (for CaCl<sub>2</sub>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_727" id="Footnote_9_727"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_727"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> According to Pickering's experiments (1886), the molecular weight in grams (that
is, 142 grams) of anhydrous sodium sulphate, on being dissolved in a large mass of water,
at 0° absorbs (hence the - sign) -1,100 heat units, at 10°&ndash;700, at 15°&ndash;275, at 20°
gives out +25, at 25° +300 calories. For the decahydrated salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O,
5° - 4,225, 10° - 4,000, 15° - 3,570, 20° - 3,160, 25° - 2,775. Hence (just as in Chapter I.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_56_103">56</a>) the heat of the combination Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O at 5° = +3,125, 10° = +3,250,
20° = +3,200, and 25° = +3,050.</p>

<p>It is evident that the decahydrated salt dissolving in water gives a decrease of temperature.
Solutions in hydrochloric acid give a still greater decrease, because they contain
the water of crystallisation in a solid state&mdash;that is, like ice&mdash;and this on melting absorbs
heat. A mixture of 15 parts of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O and 12 parts of strong hydrochloric acid
produces sufficient cold to freeze water. During the treatment with hydrochloric acid
a certain quantity of sodium chloride is formed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_728" id="Footnote_10_728"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_728"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The very large and well-formed crystals of this salt resemble the hydrate
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, or SO(OH)<sub>4</sub>. In general the replacement of hydrogen by sodium modifies
many of the properties of acids less than its replacement by other metals. This most
probably depends on the volumes being nearly equal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_729" id="Footnote_11_729"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_729"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> In solution (Berthelot) the acid salt in all probability decomposes most in the
greatest mass of water. The specific gravity (according to the determinations of
Marignac) of solutions at 15°/4° = 9,992 + 77·92<i>p</i> + 0·231<i>p</i><sup>2</sup> (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_7_725">7</a>). From these
figures, and from the specific gravities of sulphuric acid, it is evident that on mixing
solutions of this acid and sodium sulphate <i>expansion</i> will always take place; for
instance, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 25H<sub>2</sub>O with Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 25H<sub>2</sub>O increases from 483 volumes to 486. In
addition to which, in weak solutions heat is absorbed, as shown in Chapter X., Note <a href="#Footnote_27_599">27</a>.
Nevertheless, even more acid salts may be formed and obtained in a crystalline form.
For instance, on cooling a solution of 1 part of sodium sulphate in 7 parts of sulphuric
acid, crystals of the composition NaHSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are separated (Schultz, 1868). This
compound fuses at about 100°; the ordinary acid salt, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, at 149°.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_BIS_730" id="Footnote_11_BIS_730"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_BIS_730"><span class="label">[11 bis]</span></a> On decreasing the pressure, sodium hydrogen sulphate, NaHSO<sub>4</sub>, dissociates
much more easily than at the ordinary pressure; it loses water and forms the pyrosulphate,
Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>; this reaction is utilised in chemical works.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_731" id="Footnote_12_731"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_731"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Calcium sulphide, CaS, like many metallic sulphides which are soluble in water, is
decomposed by it (Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>.), CaS + H<sub>2</sub>O = CaO + H<sub>2</sub>S, because hydrogen sulphide
is a very feeble acid. If calcium sulphide be acted on by a large mass of water, lime may
be precipitated, and a state of equilibrium will be reached, when the system CaO + 2CaS
remains unchanged. Lime, being a product of the action of water on CaS, limits this
action. Therefore, if in black ash the lime were not in excess, a part of the sulphide
would be in solution (actually there is but very little). In this manner in the manufacture
of sodium carbonate the conditions of equilibrium which enter into double
decompositions have been made use of (<i>see above</i>), and the aim is to form directly the
unchangeable product CaO,2CaS. This was first regarded as a special insoluble
compound, but there is no evidence of its independent existence.</p></div>

<p><i>Methodical lixiviation</i> is the extraction, by means of water, of a soluble substance
from the mass containing it. It is carried on so as not to obtain weak aqueous solutions,
and in such a way that the residue shall not contain any of the soluble substance. This
problem is practically of great importance in many industries. It is required to extract
from the mass all that is soluble in water. This is easily effected if water be first poured
on the mass, the strong solution thus obtained decanted, then water again poured
on, time being allowed for it to act, then again decanted, and so on until fresh
water does not take up anything. But then finally such weak solutions are obtained
that it would be very disadvantageous to evaporate them. This is avoided by pouring
the fresh hot water destined for the lixiviation, not onto the fresh mass, but upon a mass
which has already been subjected to a first lixiviation by weak solutions. In this way the
fresh water gives a weak solution. The strong solution which goes to the evaporating
pan flows from those parts of the apparatus which contain the fresh, as yet unlixiviated,
mass, and thus in the latter parts the weak alkali formed in the other parts of the
apparatus becomes saturated as far as possible with the soluble substance. Generally
several intercommunicating vessels are constructed (standing at the same level) into
which in turn the fresh mass is charged which is intended for lixiviation; the water is
poured in, the alkali drawn off, and the lixiviated residue removed. The illustration
represents such an apparatus, consisting of four communicating vessels. The water
poured into one of them flows through the two nearest and issues from the third. The
fresh mass being placed in one of these boxes or vessels, the stream of water passing
through the apparatus is directed in such a manner as to finally issue from this vessel containing
the fresh unlixiviated mass. The fresh water is added to the vessel containing
the material which has been almost completely exhausted. Passing through this vessel
it is conveyed by the pipe (syphon passing from the bottom of the first box to the top of
the second) communicating with the second; it finally passes (also through a syphon
pipe) into the box (the third) containing the fresh material. The water will extract all
that is soluble in the first vessel, leaving only an insoluble residue. This vessel is then
ready to be emptied, and refilled with fresh material. The levels of the liquids in the
various vessels will naturally be different, in consequence of the various strengths of the
solutions which they contain.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be thought that sodium carbonate alone passes into the solution;
there is also a good deal of caustic soda with it, formed by the action of lime on the
carbonate of sodium, and there are also certain sodium sulphur compounds with which
we shall partly become acquainted hereafter. The sodium carbonate, therefore, is not
obtained in a very pure state. The solution is concentrated by evaporation. This is
conducted by means of the waste heat from the soda furnaces, together with that of
the gases given off. The process in the soda furnaces can only be carried on at a high
temperature, and therefore the smoke and gases issuing from them are necessarily very
hot. If the heat they contain was not made use of there would be a great waste of
fuel; consequently in immediate proximity to these furnaces there is generally a series
of pans or evaporating boilers, under which the gases pass, and into which the alkali
solution is poured. On evaporating the solution, first of all the undecomposed sodium
sulphate separates, then the sodium carbonate or soda crystals. These crystals as they
separate are raked out and placed on planks, where the liquid drains away from them.
Caustic soda remains in the residue, and also any sodium chloride which was not
decomposed in the foregoing process.</p>

<p>Part of the sodium carbonate is recrystallised in order to purify it more thoroughly.
In order to do this a saturated solution is left to crystallise at a temperature below 30°
in a current of air, in order to promote the separation of the water vapour. The large
transparent crystals (efflorescent in air) of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O are then formed which have
already been spoken of (Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_733" id="Footnote_14_733"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_733"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> The whole of the sulphur used in the production of the sulphuric acid employed in
decomposing the common salt is contained in this residue. This is the great burden
and expense of the soda works which use Leblanc's method. As an instructive example
from a chemical point of view, it is worth while mentioning here two of the various
methods of recovering the sulphur from the soda waste. Chance's process is treated in
Chapter XX., Note 6.</p>

<p>Kynaston (1885) treats the soda waste with a solution (sp. gr. l·21) of magnesium
chloride, which disengages sulphuretted hydrogen: CaS + MgCl<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = CaCl<sub>2</sub>
+ Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S. Sulphurous anhydride is passed through the residue in order to form
the insoluble calcium sulphite: CaCl<sub>2</sub> + Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub> + SO<sub>2</sub> = CaSO<sub>3</sub> + MgCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O. The
solution of magnesium chloride obtained is again used, and the washed calcium sulphite
is brought into contact at a low temperature with hydrochloric acid (a weak aqueous
solution) and hydrogen sulphide, the whole of the sulphur then separating:</p>

<p class="title">CaSO<sub>3</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>S + 2HCl = CaCl<sub>2</sub> + 3H<sub>2</sub>O + 3S.</p>

<p>But most efforts have been directed towards avoiding the formation of soda
waste.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15_734" id="Footnote_15_734"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_734"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Among the drawbacks of the Leblanc process are the accumulation of &lsquo;soda
waste&rsquo; (Note <a href="#Footnote_14_733">14</a>) owing to the impossibility at the comparatively low price of sulphur
(especially in the form of pyrites) of finding employment for the sulphur and sulphur
compounds for which this waste is sometimes treated, and also the insufficient purity
of the sodium carbonate for many purposes. The advantages of the Leblanc process,
besides its simplicity and cheapness, are that almost the whole of the acids obtained
as bye-products have a commercial value; for chlorine and bleaching powder are
produced from the large amount of hydrochloric acid which appears as a bye-product;
caustic soda also is very easily made, and the demand for it increases every year.
In those places where salt, pyrites, charcoal, and limestone (the materials required
for alkali works) are found side by side&mdash;as, for instance, in the Ural or Don
districts&mdash;conditions are favourable to the development of the manufacture of sodium
carbonate on an enormous scale; and where, as in the Caucasus, sodium sulphate
occurs naturally, the conditions are still more favourable. A large amount, however,
of the latter salt, even from soda works, is used in making glass. The most important
soda works, as regards the quantity of products obtained from them, are the English
works.</p>

<p>As an example of the other numerous and varied methods of manufacturing soda
from sodium chloride, the following may be mentioned: Sodium chloride is decomposed
by oxide of lead, PbO, forming lead chloride and sodium oxide, which, with carbonic
anhydride, yields sodium carbonate (Scheele's process). In Cornu's method sodium
chloride is treated with lime, and then exposed to the air, when it yields a small
quantity of sodium carbonate. In E. Kopp's process sodium sulphate (125 parts) is mixed
with oxide of iron (80 parts) and charcoal (55 parts), and the mixture is heated in reverberatory
furnaces. Here a compound, Na<sub>6</sub>Fe<sub>4</sub>S<sub>3</sub>, is formed, which is insoluble in water
absorbs oxygen and carbonic anhydride, and then forms sodium carbonate and ferrous
sulphide; this when roasted gives sulphurous anhydride, the indispensable material
for the manufacture of sulphuric acid, and ferric oxide which is again used in the
process. In Grant's method sodium sulphate is transformed into sodium sulphide, and
the latter is decomposed by a stream of carbonic anhydride and steam, when hydrogen
sulphide is disengaged and sodium carbonate formed. Gossage prepares Na<sub>2</sub>S from
Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (by heating it with carbon), dissolves it in water and subjects the solution to the
action of an excess of CO<sub>2</sub> in coke towers, thus obtaining H<sub>2</sub>S (a gas which gives SO<sub>2</sub>
under perfect combustion, or sulphur when incompletely burnt, Chapter XX., Note 6) and
bicarbonate of sodium; Na<sub>2</sub>S + 2CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub>S + 2HNaCO<sub>3</sub>. The latter gives soda and
CO<sub>2</sub> when ignited. This process quite eliminates the formation of soda-waste (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_3_721">3</a>)
and should in my opinion be suitable for the treatment of native Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, like that
which is found in the Caucasus, all the more since H<sub>2</sub>S gives sulphur as a bye-product.</p>

<p>Repeated efforts have been made in recent times to obtain soda (and chlorine, <i>see</i>
Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_1_47">1</a>) from strong solutions of salt (Chapter X., Note <a href="#Footnote_23_BIS_593">23 bis</a>) by the action
of an electric current, but until now these methods have not been worked out sufficiently
for practical use, probably partly owing to the complicated apparatus needed, and the
fact that the chlorine given off at the anode corrodes the electrodes and vessels and has
but a limited industrial application. We may mention that according to Hempel (1890)
soda in crystals is deposited when an electric current and a stream of carbonic acid gas
are passed through a saturated solution of NaCl.</p>

<p>Sodium carbonate may likewise be obtained from cryolite (Chapter XVII., Note 23)
the method of treating this will be mentioned under Aluminium.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_735" id="Footnote_16_735"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_735"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> This process (Chapter XVII.) was first pointed out by Turck, worked out by
Schloesing, and finally applied industrially by Solvay. The first (1883) large soda factories
erected in Russia for working this process are on the banks of the Kama at Berezniak,
near Ousolia, and belong to Lubimoff. But Russia, which still imports from abroad a
large quantity of bleaching powder and exports a large amount of manganese ore, most
of all requires works carrying on the Leblanc process. In 1890 a factory of this kind was
erected by P. K. Oushkoff, on the Kama, near Elagoubi.</p></div>

generally purer. In order to purify it further, it is best to boil a concentrated solution of
soda ash until two-thirds of the liquid remain, collect the soda which settles, wash with
cold water, and then shake up with a strong solution of ammonia, pour off the residue,
and heat. The impurities will then remain in the mother liquors, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Some numerical data may be given for sodium carbonate. The specific gravity of the
anhydrous salt is 2·48, that of the decahydrated salt 1·46. Two varieties are known of
the heptahydrated salt (Löwel, Marignac, Rammelsberg), which are formed together by
allowing a saturated solution to cool under a layer of alcohol; the one is less stable (like
the corresponding sulphate) and at 0° has a solubility of 32 parts (of anhydrous salt) in 100
water; the other is more stable, and its solubility 20 parts (of anhydrous salt) per 100 of
water. The solubility of the decahydrated salt in 100 water = at 0°, 7·0; at 20°, 21·7; at
30°, 37·2 parts (of anhydrous salt). At 80° the solubility is only 46·1, at 90° 45·7, at 100°,
45·4 parts (of anhydrous salt). That is, it falls as the temperature rises, like Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.
The specific gravity (Note <a href="#Footnote_7_725">7</a>) of the solutions of sodium carbonate, according to the data
of Gerlach and Kohlrausch, at 15°/4° is expressed by the formula, <i>s</i> = 9,992 + 104·5<i>p</i>
+ 0·165<i>p</i><sup>2</sup>. Weak solutions occupy a volume not only less than the sum of the volumes
of the anhydrous salt and the water, but even less than the water contained in them. For
instance, 1,000 grams of a 1 p.c. solution occupy (at 15°) a volume of 990·4 c.c. (sp. gr.
1·0097), but contain 990 grams of water, occupying at 15° a volume of 990·8 c.c. A
similar case, which is comparatively rare occurs also with sodium hydroxide, in those
dilute solutions for which the factor <i>A</i> is greater than 100 if the sp. gr. of water at 4° =
100,000, and if the sp. gr. of the solution be expressed by the formula <i>S</i> = <i>S</i><sub>0</sub> + <i>Ap</i> + <i>Bp</i><sup>2</sup>,
where <i>S</i><sub>0</sub> is the specific gravity of the water. For 5 p.c. the sp. gr. 15°/4° = 1·0520; for 10
p.c. 1·1057; for 15 p.c. 1·1603. The changes in the sp. gr. with the temperature are
here almost the same as with solutions of sodium chloride with an equal value of <i>p</i>.</p></div>

composition of Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, they ought to be classed under the type (NaO)<sub>2</sub>R,
where R = SO<sub>2</sub> or CO. Many other sodium salts also contain 10 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_739" id="Footnote_19_739"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_739"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> According to the observations of Pickering. According to Rose, when solutions of
sodium carbonate are boiled a certain amount of carbonic anhydride is disengaged.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20_740" id="Footnote_20_740"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_740"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The composition of this salt, however, may be also represented as a combination
of carbonic acid, H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, with the normal salt, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, just as the latter also combines
with water. Such a combination is all the more likely because (1) there exists
another salt, Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,2NaHCO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O (sodium sesquicarbonate), obtained by cooling
a boiling solution of sodium bicarbonate, or by mixing this salt with the normal
salt; but the formula of this salt cannot be derived from that of normal carbonic
acid, as the formula of the bicarbonate can. At the same time the sesqui-salt has
all the properties of a definite compound; it crystallises in transparent crystals, has
a constant composition, its solubility (at 0° in 100 of water, 12·6 of anhydrous salt)
differs from the solubility of the normal and acid salts; it is found in nature, and
is known by the names of <i>trona</i> and <i>urao</i>. The observations of Watts and Richards
showed (1886) that on pouring a strong solution of the acid salt into a solution of the
normal salt saturated by heating, crystals of the salt NaHCO<sub>3</sub>,Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O may be
easily obtained, as long as the temperature is above 35°. The natural urao (Boussingault)
has, according to Laurent, the same composition. This salt is very stable in air, and
may be used for purifying sodium carbonate on the large scale. Such compounds have
been little studied from a theoretical point of view, although particularly interesting, since
in all probability they correspond with ortho-carbonic acid, C(OH)<sub>4</sub>, and at the same time
correspond with double salts like astrakhanite (Chapter XIV., Note <a href="#Footnote_25_852">25</a>). (2) Water of
crystallisation does not enter into the composition of the crystals of the acid salt, so that on
its formation (occurring only at low temperatures, as in the formation of crystalline compounds
with water) the water of crystallisation of the normal salt separates and the water
is, as it were, replaced by the elements of carbonic acid. If anhydrous sodium carbonate
be mixed with the amount of water requisite for the formation of Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O, this salt
will, when powdered, absorb CO<sub>2</sub> as easily at the ordinary temperature as it does water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_741" id="Footnote_21_741"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_741"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> 100 parts of water at 0° dissolve 7 parts of the acid salt, which corresponds with
4·3 parts of the anhydrous normal salt, but at 0° 100 parts of water dissolve 7 parts of
the latter. The solubility of the bi- or acid salt varies with considerable regularity;
100 parts of water dissolves at 15° 9 parts of the salt, at 30° 11 parts.</p>

<p>The ammonium, and more especially the calcium, salt, is much more soluble in water.
The ammonia process (<i>see</i> p. <a href="#Page_524">524</a>) is founded upon this. Ammonium bicarbonate (acid
carbonate) at 0° has a solubility of 12 parts in 100 water, at 30° of 27 parts. The solubility
therefore increases very rapidly with the temperature. And its saturated solution
is more stable than a solution of sodium bicarbonate. In fact, saturated solutions of
these salts have a gaseous tension like that of a mixture of carbonic anhydride and water&mdash;namely,
at 15° and at 50°, for the sodium salt 120 and 750 millimetres, for the ammonium
salt 120 and 563 millimetres. These data are of great importance in understanding the
phenomena connected with the ammonia process. They indicate that with an increased
pressure the formation of the sodium salt ought to increase if there be an excess of ammonium
salt.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_742" id="Footnote_22_742"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_742"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> Crystalline sodium carbonate (broken into lumps) also absorbs carbonic anhydride,
but the water contained in the crystals is then disengaged: Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub>
= Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 9H<sub>2</sub>O, and dissolves part of the carbonate; therefore part of the sodium
carbonate passes into solution together with all the impurities. When it is required to
avoid the formation of this solution, a mixture of ignited and crystalline sodium carbonate
is taken. Sodium bicarbonate is prepared chiefly for medicinal use, and is then often
termed <i>carbonate of soda</i>, also, for instance, in the so-called soda powders, for preparing
certain artificial mineral waters, for the manufacture of digestive lozenges like those
made at Essentuki, Vichy, &amp;c.</p></div>

proceeds in the reverse way&mdash;that is, sodium and potassium hydroxides remove carbonic
anhydride from calcium carbonate (Liebig, Watson, Mitscherlich, and others). The influence
of the mass of water is evident. According to Gerberts, however, strong
solutions of sodium carbonate are decomposed by lime, which is very interesting if confirmed
by further investigation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_745" id="Footnote_25_745"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_745"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> As long as any undecomposed sodium carbonate remains in solution, excess
of acid added to the solution disengages carbonic anhydride, and the solution after dilution
gives a white precipitate with a barium salt soluble in acids, showing the presence of
a carbonate in solution (if there be sulphate present, it also forms a white precipitate,
but this is insoluble in acids). For the decomposition of sodium carbonate, milk of lime&mdash;that
is, slaked slime suspended in water&mdash;is employed. Formerly pure sodium hydroxide
was prepared (according to Berthollet's process) by dissolving the impure substance in
alcohol (sodium carbonate and sulphate are not soluble), but now that metallic sodium has
become cheap and is purified by distillation, <i>pure caustic soda</i> is prepared by acting on
a small quantity of water with sodium. Perfectly pure sodium hydroxide may also be
obtained by allowing strong solutions to crystallise (in the cold) (Note <a href="#Footnote_27_747">27</a>).</p>

<p>In alkali works where the Leblanc process is used, caustic soda is prepared directly from
the alkali remaining in the mother liquors after the separation of the sodium carbonate
by evaporation (Note <a href="#Footnote_14_733">14</a>). If excess of lime and charcoal have been used, much sodium
hydroxide maybe obtained. After the removal as much as possible of the sodium carbonate,
a red liquid (from iron oxide) is left, containing sodium hydroxide mixed with compounds
of sulphur and of cyanogen (<i>see</i> Chapter <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>.) and also containing iron. This red
alkali is evaporated and air is blown through it, which oxidises the impurities (for this
purpose sometimes sodium nitrate is added, or bleaching powder, &amp;c.) and leaves fused
caustic soda. The fused mass is allowed to settle in order to separate the ferruginous
precipitate, and poured into iron drums, where the sodium hydroxide solidifies. Such
caustic soda contains about 10 p.c. of water in excess and some saline impurities, but
when properly manufactured is almost free from carbonate and from iron. The greater
part of the caustic soda, which forms so important an article of commerce, is manufactured
in this manner.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_746" id="Footnote_26_746"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_746"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> Löwig gave a method of preparing sodium hydroxide from sodium carbonate by
heating it to a dull red heat with an excess of ferric oxide. Carbonic anhydride is given
off, and warm water extracts the caustic soda from the remaining mass. This reaction,
as experiment shows, proceeds very easily, and is an example of contact action similar
to that of ferric oxide on the decomposition of potassium chlorate. The reason
of this may be that a small quantity of the sodium carbonate enters into double decomposition
with the ferric oxide, and the ferric carbonate produced is decomposed into
carbonic anhydride and ferric oxide, the action of which is renewed. Similar explanations
expressing the <i>reason</i> for a reaction really adds but little to that elementary conception
of contact which, according to my opinion, consists in the change of motion of the
atoms in the molecules under the influence of the substance in contact. In order to
represent this clearly it is sufficient, for instance, to imagine that in the sodium carbonate
the elements CO<sub>2</sub> move in a circle round the elements Na<sub>2</sub>O, but at the points of contact
with Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> the motion becomes elliptic with a long axis, and at some distance from Na<sub>2</sub>O
the elements of CO<sub>2</sub> are parted, not having the faculty of attaching themselves to Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.</p></div>

impurities&mdash;such as, for instance, sodium sulphate&mdash;may be separated from them. The
fused crystallo-hydrate 2NaHO,7H<sub>2</sub>O forms a solution having a specific gravity of 1·405

composition of an alcohol&mdash;that is, of the hydroxide of a hydrocarbon radicle&mdash;and QHO
an acid, then the compound of the acid with the alcohol or ethereal salt of the given acid

metallic salts, just as alcohols resemble basic hydroxides. Sodium hydroxide acts on
ethereal salts in the same way that it acts on the majority of metallic salts&mdash;namely, it
liberates alcohol, and forms the sodium salt of that acid which was in the ethereal salt.

<p>Such a decomposition is termed saponification; similar reactions were known very long
ago for the ethereal salts corresponding with glycerin, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>3</sub> (Chapter <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>.), found
in animals and plants, and composing what are called fats or oils. Caustic soda,
acting on fat and oil, forms glycerin, and sodium salts of those acids which were in
union with the glycerin in the fat, as Chevreul showed at the beginning of this century.
The sodium salts of the fatty acids are commonly known as soaps. That is to say,
soap is made from fat and caustic soda, glycerin being separated and a sodium salt or
soap formed. As glycerin is usually found in union with certain acids, so also are the
sodium salts of the same acids found in soap. The greater part of the acids found in
conjunction with glycerin in fats are the solid palmitic and stearic acids, C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>32</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and
C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>38</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and the liquid oleic acid, C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>34</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In preparing soap the fatty substances
are mixed with a solution of caustic soda until an emulsion is formed; the proper
quantity of caustic soda is then added in order to produce saponification on heating,
the soap being separated from the solution either by means of an excess of caustic soda
or else by common salt, which displaces the soap from the aqueous solution (salt water
does not dissolve soap, neither does it form a lather). Water acting on soap partly
decomposes it (because the acids of the soap are feeble), and the alkali set free acts
during the application of soap. Hence it may be replaced by a very feeble alkali.
Strong solutions of alkali corrode the skin and tissues. They are not formed from soap,
because the reaction is reversible, and the alkali is only set free by the excess of water.
Thus we see how the teaching of Berthollet renders it possible to understand many
phenomena which occur in every-day experience (<i>see</i> Chapter IX., Note <a href="#Footnote_15_525">15</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_754" id="Footnote_34_754"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_754"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> On this is founded the process of Henkoff and Engelhardt for treating bones.

would easily form acid salts with acids containing more than two atoms of hydrogen&mdash;for
instance, with tribasic acids, such as phosphoric acid, H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>&mdash;and actually such salts do
exist; but all such relations are complicated by the fact that the character of the base
very often changes and becomes weakened with the increase of valency and the change
of atomic weight; the feebler bases (like silver oxide), although corresponding with
univalent metals, do not form acid salts, while the feeblest bases (CuO, PbO, &amp;c.) easily
form basic salts, and notwithstanding their valency do not form acid salts which are in
any degree stable&mdash;that is, which are undecomposable by water. Basic and acid salts
ought to be regarded rather as compounds similar to crystallo-hydrates, because such
acids as sulphuric form with sodium not only an acid and a normal salt, as might be expected
from the valency of sodium, but also salts containing a greater quantity of acid.
In sodium sesquicarbonate we saw an example of such compounds. Taking all this into
consideration, we must say that the property of more or less easily forming acid salts
depends more upon the energy of the base than upon its valency, and the best statement
is that <i>the capacity of a base for forming acid and basic salts is characteristic</i>, just
as the faculty of forming compounds with hydrogen is characteristic of elements.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_36_757" id="Footnote_36_757"></a><a href="#FNanchor_36_757"><span class="label">[36]</span></a> Deville supposes that such a decomposition of sodium hydroxide by metallic iron
depends solely on the dissociation of the alkali at a white heat into sodium, hydrogen,
and oxygen. Here the part played by the iron is only that it retains the oxygen formed,
otherwise the decomposed elements would again reunite upon cooling, as in other cases
of dissociation. If it be supposed that the temperature at the commencement of the dissociation
of the iron oxides is higher than that of sodium oxide, then the decomposition
may be explained by Deville's hypothesis. Deville demonstrates his views by the following
experiment:&mdash;An iron bottle, filled with iron borings, was heated in such a way that
the upper part became red hot, the lower part remaining cooler; sodium hydroxide was
introduced into the upper part. The decomposition was then effected&mdash;that is, sodium
vapours were produced (this experiment was really performed with potassium hydroxide).
On opening the bottle it was found that the iron in the upper part was not oxidised,
but only that in the lower part. This may be explained by the decomposition of the
alkali into sodium, hydrogen, and oxygen taking place in the upper part, whilst the iron
in the lower part absorbed the oxygen set free. If the whole bottle be subjected to the
same moderate heat as the lower extremity, no metallic vapours are formed. In that
case, according to the hypothesis, the temperature is insufficient for the dissociation of
the sodium hydroxide.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_758" id="Footnote_37_758"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_758"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> It has been previously remarked (Chapter II. Note <a href="#Footnote_9_132">9</a>) that Beketoff showed

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_759" id="Footnote_38_759"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_759"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Since the close of the eighties in England, where the preparation of sodium is at
present carried out on a large commercial scale (from 1860 to 1870 it was only
manufactured in a few works in France), it has been the practice to add to Deville's
mixture iron, or iron oxide which with the charcoal gives metallic and carburetted iron,
which still further facilitates the decomposition. At present a kilogram of sodium may
be purchased for about the same sum (2/-) as a gram cost thirty years ago. Castner, in
England, greatly improved the manufacture of sodium in large quantities, and so
cheapened it as a reducing agent in the preparation of metallic aluminium. He heated
a mixture of 44 parts of NaHO, and 7 parts of carbide of iron in large iron retorts
at 1,000° and obtained about 6&frac12; parts of metallic sodium. The reaction proceeds
more easily than with carbon or iron alone, and the decomposition of the NaHO proceeds
according to the equation: 3NaHO + C = Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 3H + Na. Subsequently, in 1891,
aluminium was prepared by electrolysis (<i>see</i> Chapter XVII.), and metallic sodium found
two new uses; (1) for the manufacture of peroxide of sodium (see later on) which is used
in bleaching works, and (2) in the manufacture of potassium and sodium cyanide from
yellow prussiate (Chapter XIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_12_789">12</a>).</p></div>

results, it is thought to be NaHg<sub>5</sub>. A similar amalgam is very easily obtained if a
3 p.c. amalgam be left several days in a solution of sodium hydroxide until a crystalline
mass is formed, from which the mercury may be removed by strongly pressing in chamois
leather. This amalgam with a solution of potassium hydroxide forms a potassium
amalgam, KHg<sub>10</sub>. It may be mentioned here that the latent heat of fusion (of atomic
quantities) of Hg = 360 (Personne), Na = 730 (Joannis), and K = 610 calories (Joannis).</p></div>

therefore from the volume of Na<sub>2</sub>H some idea may be formed of the volume of
hydrogen in a solid or liquid state. Even Archimedes concluded that there was gold
in an alloy of copper and gold by reason of its volume and density. From the fact that
the density of Na<sub>2</sub>H is equal to 0·959, it may be seen that the volume of 47 grams (the
gram molecule) of this compound = 49·0 c.c. The volume of 46 grams of sodium contained
in the Na<sub>2</sub>H (the density under the same conditions being 0·97) is equal to 47·4
c.c. Therefore the volume of 1 gram of hydrogen in Na<sub>2</sub>H is equal to 1·6 c.c., and consequently
the density of metallic hydrogen, or the weight of 1 c.c., approaches 0·6 gram.
This density is also proper to the hydrogen alloyed with potassium and palladium.
Judging from the scanty information which is at present available, liquid hydrogen near
its absolute boiling point (Chapter <a href="#Page_113">II</a>.) has a much lower density.</p></div>

Thénard, has formed the object of repeated research, but has been most fully investigated
by A. W. Titherley (1894). Until recently the following was all that was known about
this compound:&mdash;</p>

<p>By heating sodium in dry ammonia, Gay-Lussac and Thénard obtained an olive-green,
easily-fusible mass, <i>sodamide</i>, NH<sub>2</sub>Na, hydrogen being separated. This substance
with water forms sodium hydroxide and ammonia; with carbonic oxide, CO, it forms
sodium cyanide, NaCN, and water, H<sub>2</sub>O; and with dry hydrogen chloride it forms sodium
and ammonium chlorides. These and other reactions of sodamide show that the metal
in it preserves its energetic properties in reaction, and that this compound of sodium is
more stable than the corresponding chlorine amide. When heated, sodamide, NH<sub>2</sub>Na,
only partially decomposes, with evolution of hydrogen, the principal part of it giving
ammonia and sodium nitride, Na<sub>3</sub>N, according to the equation 3NH<sub>2</sub>Na = 2NH<sub>3</sub> + NNa<sub>3</sub>.
The latter is an almost black powdery mass, decomposed by water into ammonia and
sodium hydroxide.</p>

<p>Titherley's researches added the following data:&mdash;</p>

<p>Iron or silver vessels should be used in preparing this body, because glass and
porcelain are corroded at 300°&ndash;400°, at which temperature ammonia gas acts upon
sodium and forms the amide with the evolution of hydrogen. The reaction proceeds
slowly, but is complete if there be an excess of NH<sub>3</sub>. Pure NH<sub>2</sub>Na is colourless (its
colouration is due to various impurities), semi-transparent, shows traces of crystallisation,
has a conchoidal fracture, and melts at 145°. Judging from the increase in weight of
the sodium and the quantity of hydrogen which is disengaged, the composition of the
amide is exactly NH<sub>2</sub>Na. It partially volatilises (sublimes) in vacuo at 200°, and breaks
up into 2Na + N<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub> at 500°. The same amide is formed when oxide of sodium is
heated in NH<sub>3</sub>: Na<sub>2</sub>O + 2NH<sub>3</sub> = 2NaH<sub>2</sub>N + H<sub>2</sub>O. NaHO is also formed to some extent
by the resultant H<sub>2</sub>O. Potassium and lithium form similar amides. With water,
alcohol, and acids, NH<sub>2</sub>Na gives NH<sub>3</sub> and NaHO, which react further. Anhydrous CaO
absorbs NH<sub>2</sub>Na when heated without decomposing it. When sodamide is heated with
SiO<sub>2</sub>, NH<sub>3</sub> is disengaged, and silicon nitride formed. It acts still more readily upon
boric anhydride when heated with it: 2NH<sub>2</sub>Na + B<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> = 2BN + 2NaHO + H<sub>2</sub>O. When
slightly heated, NH<sub>2</sub>Na + NOCl = NaCl + N<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O (NHNa<sub>2</sub> and NNa<sub>3</sub> are apparently not
formed at a higher temperature). The halogen organic compounds react with the aid
of heat, but with so much energy that the reaction frequently leads to the ultimate destruction
of the organic groups and production of carbon.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_769" id="Footnote_45_769"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_769"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> As sodium does not displace hydrogen from the hydrocarbons, <i>it may be preserved</i>
in liquid hydrocarbons. Naphtha is generally used for this purpose, as it consists of a
mixture of various liquid hydrocarbons. However, in naphtha sodium usually becomes
coated with a crust composed of matter produced by the action of the sodium on certain
of the substances contained in the mixture composing naphtha. In order that sodium
may retain its lustre in naphtha, secondary octyl alcohol is added. (This alcohol is
obtained by distilling castor oil with caustic potash.) Sodium keeps well in a mixture
of pure benzene and paraffin.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_770" id="Footnote_46_770"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_770"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> If sodium does not directly displace the hydrogen in hydrocarbons, still by indirect
means compounds may be obtained which contain sodium and hydrocarbon groups.
Some of these compounds have been produced, although not in a pure state. Thus, for
instance, zinc ethyl, Zn(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, when treated with sodium, loses zinc and forms sodium
ethyl, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>Na, but this decomposition is not complete, and the compound formed cannot
be separated by distillation from the remaining zinc ethyl. In this compound the
energy of the sodium is clearly manifest, for it reacts with substances containing haloids,
oxygen, &amp;c., and directly absorbs carbonic anhydride, forming a salt of a carboxylic acid
(propionic).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_BIS_771" id="Footnote_46_BIS_771"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_BIS_771"><span class="label">[46 bis]</span></a> It is even doubtful whether the suboxide exists (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_47_772">47</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_772" id="Footnote_47_772"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_772"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> A compound, Na<sub>2</sub>Cl, which corresponds with the suboxide, is apparently formed
when a galvanic current is passed through fused common salt; the sodium liberated
dissolves in the common salt, and does not separate from the compound either on
cooling or on treatment with mercury. It is therefore supposed to be Na<sub>2</sub>Cl; the
more so as the mass obtained gives hydrogen when treated with water: Na<sub>2</sub>Cl + H<sub>2</sub>O
= H + NaHO + NaCl, that is, it acts like suboxide of sodium. If Na<sub>2</sub>Cl really exists as a
salt, then the corresponding base Na<sub>4</sub>O, according to the rule with other bases of the
composition M<sub>4</sub>O, ought to be called a quaternary oxide. According to certain evidence,
a suboxide is formed when thin sheets or fine drops of sodium slowly oxidise in moist air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_48_773" id="Footnote_48_773"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_773"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> According to observations easily made, sodium when fused in air oxidises but does
not burn, the combustion only commencing with the formation of vapour&mdash;that is, when
considerably heated. Davy and Karsten obtained the oxides of potassium, K<sub>2</sub>O, and of
sodium, Na<sub>2</sub>O, by heating the metals with their hydroxides, whence NaHO + Na = Na<sub>2</sub>O + H,
but N. N. Beketoff failed to obtain oxides by this means. He prepared them by directly
igniting the metals in dry air, and afterwards heating with the metal in order to destroy
any peroxide. The oxide produced, Na<sub>2</sub>O, when heated in an atmosphere of hydrogen,
gave a mixture of sodium and its hydroxide: Na<sub>2</sub>O + H = NaHO + Na (<i>see</i> Chapter II.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_9_132">9</a>). If both the observations mentioned are accurate, then the reaction is reversible.
Sodium oxide ought to be formed during the decomposition of sodium carbonate by oxide
of iron (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_26_746">26</a>), and during the decomposition of sodium nitrite. According to
Karsten, its specific gravity is 2·8, according to Beketoff 2·3. The difficulty in obtaining
it is owing to an excess of sodium forming the suboxide, and an excess of oxygen the
peroxide. The grey colour peculiar to the suboxide and oxide perhaps shows that they
contain metallic sodium. In addition to this, in the presence of water it may contain
sodium hydride and NaHO.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_774" id="Footnote_49_774"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_774"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> Of the oxides of sodium, that easiest to form is the peroxide, NaO or Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>; this
is obtained when sodium is burnt in an excess of oxygen. If NaNO<sub>3</sub> be melted, it gives
Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> with metallic Na. In a fused state the peroxide is reddish yellow, but it becomes
almost colourless when cold. When heated with iodine vapour, it loses oxygen: Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> +I<sub>2</sub>
= Na<sub>2</sub>OI<sub>2</sub> + O. The compound Na<sub>2</sub>OI<sub>2</sub> is akin to the compound Cu<sub>2</sub>OCl<sub>2</sub> obtained by
oxidising CuCl. This reaction is one of the few in which iodine directly displaces
oxygen. The substance Na<sub>2</sub>OI<sub>2</sub> is soluble in water, and when acidified gives free iodine
and a sodium salt. Carbonic oxide is absorbed by heated sodium peroxide with formation
of sodium carbonate: Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CO, whilst carbonic anhydride liberates oxygen
from it. With nitrous oxide it reacts thus: Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> +2N<sub>2</sub>O = 2NaNO<sub>2</sub> +N<sub>2</sub>; with nitric
oxide it combines directly, forming sodium nitrite, NaO + NO = NaNO<sub>2</sub>. Sodium peroxide,
when treated with water, does not give hydrogen peroxide, because the latter in the
presence of the alkali formed (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>+ 2H<sub>2</sub>O = 2NaHO + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) decomposes into water
and oxygen. In the presence of dilute sulphuric acid it forms H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
= Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Peroxide of sodium is now prepared on a large scale (by the action of air
upon Na at 300°) for bleaching wool, silk &amp;c. (when it acts in virtue of the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> formed).
The oxidising properties of Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> under the action of heat are seen, for instance, in the
fact that when heated with I it forms sodium iodate; with PbO, Na<sub>2</sub>PbO<sub>3</sub>; with pyrites,
sulphates, &amp;c. When peroxide of sodium comes into contact with water, it evolves much
heat, forming H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and decomposing with the disengagement of oxygen; but, as a rule,
there is no explosion. But if Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> be placed in contact with organic matter, such as
sawdust, cotton, &amp;c., it gives a violent explosion when heated, ignited, or acted on by
water. Peroxide of sodium forms an excellent oxidising agent for the preparation of the
higher product of oxidation of Mn, Cr, W, &amp;c., and also for oxidising the metallic
sulphides. It should therefore find many applications in chemical analysis. To prepare
Na<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on a large scale, Castner melts Na in an aluminium vessel, and at 300° passes
first air deprived of a portion of its oxygen (having been already once used), and then
ordinary dry air over it.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">POTASSIUM, RUBIDIUM, CÆSIUM, AND LITHIUM. SPECTRUM ANALYSIS</span></h2>

<p>Just as the series of halogens, fluorine, bromine and iodine correspond
with the chlorine contained in common salt, so also there exists a corresponding
series of elements: lithium, Li = 7, potassium, K = 39,
rubidium, Rb = 85, and cæsium, Cs = 133, which are analogous to the
sodium in common salt. These elements bear as great a resemblance
to sodium, Na = 23, as fluorine, F = 19, bromine, Br = 80, and iodine,
I = 127, do to chlorine, Cl = 35·5. Indeed, in a free state, these
elements, like sodium, are soft metals which rapidly oxidise in moist
air and decompose water at the ordinary temperature, forming soluble
hydroxides having clearly-defined basic properties and the composition
RHO, like that of caustic soda. The resemblance between these metals
is sometimes seen with striking clearness, especially in compounds such
as salts.<a name="FNanchor_1_775" id="FNanchor_1_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_775" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The corresponding salts of nitric, sulphuric, carbonic, and
nearly all acids with these metals have many points in common. The
metals which resemble sodium so much in their reactions are termed
the <i>metals of the alkalis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[544]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the metals of the alkalis, the most widely distributed in
nature, after sodium, is <i>potassium</i>. Like sodium, it does not appear
either in a free state or as oxide or hydroxide, but in the form of salts,
which present much in common with the salts of sodium in the manner
of their occurrence. The compounds of potassium and sodium in the
earth's crust occur as mineral compounds of silica. With silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>,
potassium oxide, like sodium oxide, forms saline mineral substances
resembling glass. If other oxides, such as lime, CaO, and alumina,
Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, combine with these compounds, glass is formed, a vitreous
stony mass, distinguished by its great stability, and its very slight
variation under the action of water. It is such complex silicious compounds
as these which contain potash (potassium oxide), K<sub>2</sub>O, or soda
(sodium oxide), Na<sub>2</sub>O, and sometimes both together, silica, SiO<sub>2</sub>, lime,
CaO, alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and other oxides, that form the chief mass of
rocks, out of which, judging by the direction of the strata, the chief
mass of the accessible crust (envelope) of the earth is made up. The
primary rocks, like granite, porphyry, &amp;c.,<a name="FNanchor_1_BIS_776" id="FNanchor_1_BIS_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_BIS_776" class="fnanchor">[1 bis]</a> are formed of such crystalline
silicious rocks as these. The oxides entering into the composition
of these rocks do not form a homogeneous amorphous mass like glass,
but are distributed in a series of peculiar, and in the majority of cases
crystalline, compounds, into which the primary rocks may be divided.
Thus a felspar (orthoclase) in granite contains from 8 to 15 per cent. of
potassium, whilst another variety (plagioclase) which also occurs in
granite contains 1·2 to 6 per cent. of potassium, and 6 to 12 per cent.
of sodium. The mica in granite contains 3 to 10 per cent. of potassium.
As already mentioned, and further explained in Chapter XVII.,
the friable, crumbling, and stratified formations which in our times
cover a large part of the earth's surface have been formed from these
primary rocks by the action of the atmosphere and of water containing
carbonic acid. It is evident that in the chemical alteration of the
primary rocks by the action of water, the compounds of potassium, as
well as the compounds of sodium, must have been dissolved by the
water (as they are soluble in water), and that therefore the compounds
of potassium must be accumulated together with those of sodium in sea
water. And indeed compounds of potassium are always found in <i>sea
water</i>, as we have already pointed out (Chapters <a href="#Page_40">I</a>. and <a href="#Page_417">X</a>.). This
forms one of the sources from which they are extracted. After the
evaporation of sea water, there remains a mother liquor, which contains
potassium chloride and a large proportion of magnesium chloride. On
cooling this solution crystals separate out which contain chlorides of
magnesium and potassium. A double salt of this kind, called <i>carnallite</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[545]</a></span>
KMgCl<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, occurs at Stassfurt. This carnallite<a name="FNanchor_2_777" id="FNanchor_2_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_777" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> is now employed
as a material for the extraction of potassium chloride, and of all
the compounds of this element.<a name="FNanchor_3_778" id="FNanchor_3_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_778" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Besides which, potassium chloride
itself is sometimes found at Stassfurt as <i>sylvine</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_BIS_779" id="FNanchor_3_BIS_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_BIS_779" class="fnanchor">[3 bis]</a> By a method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">[546]</a></span>
double saline decomposition, the chloride of potassium may be converted
into all the other potassium salts,<a name="FNanchor_4_780" id="FNanchor_4_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_780" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> some of which are of practical use.
The potassium salts have, however, their greatest importance as an
indispensable component of the food of plants.<a name="FNanchor_5_781" id="FNanchor_5_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_781" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The primary rocks contain an almost equal proportion of potassium
and sodium. But in sea water the compounds of the latter metal predominate.
It may be asked, what became of the compounds of potassium
in the disintegration of the primary rocks, if so small a quantity
went to the sea water? They remained with the other products of the
decomposition of the primary rocks. When granite or any other
similar rock formation is disintegrated, there are formed, besides the
soluble substances, also insoluble substances&mdash;sand and finely-divided
clay, containing water, alumina, and silica. This clay is carried away
by the water, and is then deposited in strata. It, and especially
its admixture with vegetable remains, retain compounds of potassium
in a greater quantity than those of sodium. This has been proved
with absolute certainty to be the case, and is due to the <i>absorptive
power of the soil</i>. If a dilute solution of a potassium compound be
filtered through common mould used for growing plants, containing
clay and the remains of vegetable decomposition, this mould will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">[547]</a></span>
found to have retained a somewhat considerable percentage of the
potassium compounds. If a salt of potassium be taken, then during
the filtration an equivalent quantity of a salt of calcium&mdash;which is also
found, as a rule, in soils&mdash;is set free. Such a process of filtration
through finely divided earthy substances proceeds in nature, and the
compounds of potassium are everywhere retained by the friable earth
in considerable quantity. This explains the presence of so small an
amount of potassium salts in the water of rivers, lakes, streams, and
oceans, where the lime and soda have accumulated. The compounds of
potassium retained by the friable mass of the earth are absorbed as an
aqueous solution by the roots of <i>plants</i>. Plants, as everyone knows,
when burnt leave an ash, and this ash, besides various other substances,
without exception contains compounds of potassium. Many land
plants contain a very small amount of sodium compounds,<a name="FNanchor_6_782" id="FNanchor_6_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_782" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> whilst
potassium and its compounds occur in all kinds of vegetable ash.
Among the generally cultivated plants, grass, potatoes, the turnip,
and buckwheat are particularly rich in potassium compounds. The
ash of plants, and especially of herbaceous plants, buckwheat straw,
sunflower and potato leaves are used in practice for the extraction of
potassium compounds. There is no doubt that potassium occurs in the
plants themselves in the form of complex compounds, and often as salts
of organic acids. In certain cases such salts of potassium are even
extracted from the juice of plants. Thus, sorrel and oxalis, for example,
contain in their juices the acid oxalate of potassium, C<sub>2</sub>HKO<sub>4</sub>, which is
employed for removing ink stains. Grape juice contains the so-called
cream of tartar, which is the acid tartrate of potassium, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>KO<sub>6</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_7_783" id="FNanchor_7_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_783" class="fnanchor">[7]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">[548]</a></span>
This salt also separates as a sediment from wine. When the plants,
containing one or more of the salts of potassium, are burnt, the
carbonaceous matter is oxidised, and in consequence the potassium is
obtained in the ash as carbonate, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, which is generally known
as <i>potashes</i>. Hence potashes occur ready prepared in the ash of
plants, and therefore the ash of land plants is employed as a source
for the extraction of potassium compounds. Potassium carbonate is
extracted by lixiviating the ash with water.<a name="FNanchor_8_784" id="FNanchor_8_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_784" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Potassium carbonate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">[549]</a></span>
may also be obtained from the chloride by a method similar to that by
which sodium carbonate is prepared from sodium chloride.<a name="FNanchor_8_BIS_785" id="FNanchor_8_BIS_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_BIS_785" class="fnanchor">[8 bis]</a> There is no
difficulty in obtaining any salt of potassium&mdash;for example, the sulphate,<a name="FNanchor_9_786" id="FNanchor_9_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_786" class="fnanchor">[9]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">[550]</a></span>
bromide, and iodide<a name="FNanchor_10_787" id="FNanchor_10_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_787" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>&mdash;by the action of the corresponding acid on KCl
and especially on the carbonate, whilst the hydroxide, <i>caustic potash</i>,
KHO, which is in many respects analogous to caustic soda, is easily obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">[551]</a></span>
by means of lime in exactly the same manner in which sodium
hydroxide is prepared from sodium carbonate.<a name="FNanchor_11_788" id="FNanchor_11_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_788" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Therefore, in order to
complete our knowledge of the alkali metals, we will only describe two
salts of potassium which are of practical importance, and whose
analogues have not been described in the <a href="#Page_513">preceding chapter</a>, potassium
cyanide and potassium nitrate.</p>

<p><i>Potassium cyanide</i>, which presents in its chemical relations a certain
analogy with the halogen salts of potassium, is not only formed according
to the equation, KHO + HCN = H<sub>2</sub>O + KCN, but also whenever
a nitrogenous carbon compound&mdash;for instance, animal matter&mdash;is
heated in the presence of metallic potassium, or of a compound of
potassium, and even when a mixture of potash and carbon is heated in
a stream of nitrogen. Potassium cyanide is obtained from yellow
prussiate, which has been already mentioned in Chapter <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>., and
whose preparation on a large scale will be described in Chapter XXII.
If the yellow prussiate be ground to a powder and dried, so that it loses
its water of crystallisation, it then melts at a red heat, and decomposes
into carbide of iron, nitrogen, and potassium cyanide, FeK<sub>4</sub>C<sub>6</sub>N_6
= 4KCN + FeC<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>. After the decomposition it is found that the
yellow salt has been converted into a white mass of potassium cyanide.
The carbide of iron formed collects at the bottom of the vessel. If
the mass thus obtained be treated with water, the potassium cyanide
is partially decomposed by the water, but if it be treated with alcohol,
then the cyanide is dissolved, and on cooling separates in a crystalline
form.<a name="FNanchor_12_789" id="FNanchor_12_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_789" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> A solution of potassium cyanide has a powerfully alkaline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">[552]</a></span>
reaction, a smell like that of bitter almonds, peculiar to prussic acid,
and acts as a most powerful poison. Although exceedingly stable
in a fused state, potassium cyanide easily changes when in solution.
Prussic acid is so very feebly energetic that even water decomposes
potassium cyanide. A solution of the salt, even without access of air,
easily turns brown and decomposes, and when heated evolves ammonia
and forms potassium formate; this is easily comprehensible from the
representation of the cyanogen compounds which was developed in
Chapter <a href="#Page_379">IX</a>., KCN + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = CHKO<sub>2</sub> + NH<sub>3</sub>. Furthermore, as
carbonic anhydride acts on potassium cyanide with evolution of prussic
acid, and as potassium cyanate, which is also unstable, is formed by the
action of air, it will be easily seen that solutions of potassium cyanide
are very unstable. Potassium cyanide, containing as it does carbon
and potassium, is a substance which can act in a very vigorously reducing
manner, especially when fused; it is therefore used as a
powerful reducing agent at a red heat.<a name="FNanchor_13_790" id="FNanchor_13_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_790" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The property of potassium
cyanide of giving double salts with other cyanides is very clearly shown
by the fact that many metals dissolve in a solution of potassium cyanide,
with the evolution of hydrogen. For example, iron, copper, and zinc
act in this manner. Thus&mdash;</p>

<p>Gold and silver are soluble in potassium cyanide in the presence of
air, in which case the hydrogen, which would otherwise be evolved in
the reaction, combines with the oxygen of the air, forming water (Eissler,
MacLaurin, 1893), for example, 4Au + 4KCN + O + H<sub>2</sub>O = 2AuKC<sub>2</sub>N<sub>2</sub>
+ 2KHO, which is taken advantage of for extracting gold from its
ores (Chapter XXIV.).<a name="FNanchor_13_BIS_791" id="FNanchor_13_BIS_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_BIS_791" class="fnanchor">[13 bis]</a> Platinum, mercury, and tin are not dissolved

<p><i>Potassium nitrate</i>, or common <i>nitre</i> or <i>saltpetre</i>, KNO<sub>3</sub>, is chiefly
used as a component part of gunpowder, in which it cannot be replaced
by the sodium salt, because the latter is deliquescent. It is necessary
that the nitre in gunpowder should be perfectly pure, as even small
traces of sodium, magnesium, and calcium salts, especially chlorides,
render the nitre and the gunpowder capable of attracting moisture.
Nitre may easily be obtained pure, owing to its great disposition to
form crystals both large and small, which aids its separation from other
salts. The considerable differences between the solubility of nitre at
different temperatures aids this crystallisation. A solution of nitre
saturated at its boiling point (116°) contains 335 parts of nitre to 100
parts of water, whilst at the ordinary temperature&mdash;for instance, 20°&mdash;the
solution is only able to retain 32 parts of the salt. Therefore, in
the preparation and refining of nitre, its solution, saturated at the
boiling point, is cooled, and nearly all the nitre is obtained in the form
of crystals. If the solution be quietly and slowly cooled in large
quantities then large crystals are formed, but if it be rapidly cooled and
agitated then small crystals are obtained. In this manner, if not all,
at all events the majority, of the impurities present in small quantities
remain in the mother liquor. If an unsaturated solution of nitre be
rapidly cooled, so as to prevent the formation of large crystals (in whose
crevices the mother liquor, together with the impurities, would remain),
the very minute crystals of nitre known as saltpetre flour are obtained.</p>

<p>Common nitre occurs in nature, but only in small quantities in
admixture with other nitrates, and especially with sodium, magnesium,
and calcium nitrates. Such a mixture of salts of nitric acid is formed
in nature in fertile earth, and in those localities where, as in <i>the soil</i>,
nitrogenous organic remains are decomposed in the presence of alkalis
or alkaline bases with free access of air. This method of the formation
of nitrates requires moisture, besides the free access of air, and takes
place principally during warm weather.<a name="FNanchor_14_792" id="FNanchor_14_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_792" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> In warm countries, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">[554]</a></span>
temperate climates during the summer months, fertile soils produce a
small quantity of nitre. In this respect India is especially known as
affording a considerable supply of nitre extracted from the soil. The
nitre-bearing soil after the rainy season sometimes becomes covered
during the summer with crystals of nitre, formed by the evaporation
of the water in which it was previously dissolved. This soil is collected,
subjected to repeated lixiviations, and treated for nitre as will
be presently described. In temperate climates nitrates are obtained
from the lime rubbish of demolished buildings which have stood for
many years, and especially from those portions which have been in contact
with the ground. The conditions there are very favourable for
the formation of nitre, because the lime used as a cement in buildings
contains the base necessary for the formation of nitrates, while the
excrement, urine, and animal refuse are sources of nitrogen. By the
methodical lixiviation of this kind of rubbish a solution of nitrogenous
salts is formed similar to that obtained by the lixiviation of fertile
soil. A similar solution is also obtained by the lixiviation of the so-called
<i>nitre plantations</i>. They are composed of manure interlaid with
brushwood, and strewn over with ashes, lime, and other alkaline
rubbish. These nitre plantations are set up in those localities where
the manure is not required for the fertilisation of the soil, as, for
example, in the south-eastern &lsquo;black earth&rsquo; Governments of Russia.
The same process of oxidation of nitrogenous matter freely exposed to
air and moisture during the warm season in the presence of alkalis
takes place in nitre plantations as in fertile soil and in the walls of
buildings. From all these sources there is obtained a solution containing
various salts of nitric acid mixed with soluble organic matter.
The simplest method of treating this impure solution of nitre is to
add a solution of potassium carbonate, or to simply treat it with
ashes containing this substance. The potassium carbonate enters into
double decomposition with the calcium and magnesium salts, forming
insoluble carbonates of these bases and leaving the nitre in solution.
Thus, for instance, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> = 2KNO<sub>3</sub> + CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Both
calcium and magnesium carbonates are insoluble, and therefore after
treatment with potassium carbonate the solution no longer contains
salts of these metals but only the salts of sodium and potassium
together with organic matter. The latter partially separates on
heating in an insoluble form, and is entirely destroyed by heating the
nitre to a low red heat. The nitre thus obtained is easily purified by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">[555]</a></span>
repeated crystallisation. The greater part of the nitre used for
making gunpowder is now obtained from the sodium salt <i>Chili saltpetre</i>
or <i>cubic nitre</i>, which occurs in nature, as already mentioned.
The conversion of this salt into common nitre is also carried on by
means of a double decomposition. This is done either by adding
potassium carbonate (when, on mixing the strong and hot solutions,
sodium carbonate is directly obtained as a precipitate), or, as is now
most frequent, potassium chloride. When a mixture of strong solutions
of potassium chloride and sodium nitrate is evaporated, sodium
chloride first separates, because this salt, which is formed by the
double decomposition KCl + NaNO<sub>3</sub> = KNO<sub>3</sub> + NaCl, is almost
equally soluble in hot and cold water; on cooling, therefore, a large
amount of potassium nitrate separates from the saturated solution,
while the sodium chloride remains dissolved. The nitre is ultimately
purified by recrystallisation and by washing with a saturated solution
of nitre, which cannot dissolve a further quantity of nitre but only
the impurities.</p>

<p>Nitre is a colourless salt having a peculiar cool taste. It crystallises
easily in long striated six-sided rhombic prisms terminating in
rhombic pyramids. Its crystals (sp. gr. 1·93) do not contain water, but
their cavities generally contain a certain quantity of the solution from
which they have crystallised. For this reason in refining nitre, the
production of large crystals is prevented, <i>saltpetre flour</i> being prepared.
At a low red heat (339°) nitre melts to a colourless liquid.<a name="FNanchor_14_BIS_793" id="FNanchor_14_BIS_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_BIS_793" class="fnanchor">[14 bis]</a>
Potassium nitrate at the ordinary temperature and in a solid form is
inactive and stable, but <i>at a high temperature</i> it acts as a powerful
<i>oxidising agent</i>, giving up a considerable amount of oxygen to substances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">[556]</a></span>
mixed with it.<a name="FNanchor_15_794" id="FNanchor_15_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_794" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> When thrown on to incandescent charcoal it brings
about its rapid combustion, and a mechanical mixture of powdered
charcoal and nitre ignites when brought into contact with a red-hot
substance, and continues to burn by itself. In this action, nitrogen
is evolved, and the oxygen oxidises the charcoal, in consequence of
which potassium carbonate and carbonic anhydride are formed:
4KNO<sub>3</sub> + 5C = 2K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 3CO<sub>2</sub> + 2N<sub>2</sub>. This phenomenon depends on
the fact that oxygen in combining with carbon evolves more heat than
it does in combining with nitrogen. Hence, when once the combustion
has been started at the expense of the nitre, it is able to go on without
requiring the aid of external heat. A similar oxidation or combustion at
the expense of the contained oxygen takes place when nitre is heated
with different combustible substances. If a mixture of sulphur and
nitre be thrown upon a red-hot surface, the sulphur burns, forming
potassium sulphate and sulphurous anhydride. In this case, also, the
nitrogen of the nitre is evolved as gas: 2KNO<sub>3</sub> + 2S = K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>
+ SO<sub>2</sub>. A similar phenomenon occurs when nitre is heated with
many metals. The oxidation of those metals which are able to form
acid oxides with an excess of oxygen is especially remarkable. In
this case they remain in combination with potassium oxide as potassium
salts. Manganese, antimony, arsenic, iron, chromium, &amp;c. are instances
of this kind. These elements, like carbon and sulphur, displace
free nitrogen. The lower oxides of these metals when fused with nitre
pass into the higher oxides. Organic substances are also oxidised
when heated with nitre&mdash;that is, they burn at the expense of the nitre.
It will be readily understood from this that nitre is frequently used in
practical chemistry and the arts as an oxidising agent at high temperatures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">[557]</a></span>
Its application in <i>gunpowder</i> is based on this property; gunpowder
consists of a mechanical mixture of finely-ground sulphur, nitre,
and charcoal. The relative proportion of these substances varies according
to the destination of the powder and to the kind of charcoal employed
(a friable, incompletely-burnt charcoal, containing therefore hydrogen
and oxygen, is employed). Gases are formed in its combustion, chiefly
nitrogen and carbonic anhydride, which create a considerable pressure
if their escape be in any way impeded. This action of gunpowder
may be expressed by the equation: 2KNO<sub>3</sub> + 3C + S = K<sub>2</sub>S + 3CO<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>It is found by this equation that gunpowder should contain thirty-six
parts of charcoal (13·3 p.c.), and thirty-two parts (11·9 p.c.) of sulphur,
to 202 parts (74·8 p.c.) of nitre, which is very near to its actual
composition.<a name="FNanchor_16_795" id="FNanchor_16_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_795" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">[558]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Metallic potassium</i> was obtained like sodium; first by the action of
a galvanic current, then by reduction of the hydroxide by means of
metallic iron, and lastly, by the action of charcoal on the carbonate at
a high temperature. The behaviour of metallic potassium differs, however,
from that of sodium, because it easily combines with carbonic
oxide, forming an explosive and inflammable mass.<a name="FNanchor_17_796" id="FNanchor_17_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_796" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Potassium is quite as volatile as sodium, if not more so. At the
ordinary temperature potassium is even softer than sodium; its freshly-cut
surfaces present a whiter colour than sodium, but, like the latter,
and with even greater ease, it oxidises in moist air. It is brittle at low
temperatures, but is quite soft at 25°, and melts at 58°. At a low red
heat (667°, Perkin) it distils without change, forming a green vapour,
whose density,<a name="FNanchor_18_797" id="FNanchor_18_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_797" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> according to A. Scott (1887), is equal to 19 (if that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">[559]</a></span>
hydrogen = 1). This shows that the molecule of potassium (like that
of sodium, mercury, and zinc) contains but one atom. This is also the
case with many other metals, judging by recent researches.<a name="FNanchor_19_798" id="FNanchor_19_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_798" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The
specific gravity of potassium at 15° is 0·87, and is therefore less than
that of sodium, as is also the case with all its compounds.<a name="FNanchor_20_799" id="FNanchor_20_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_799" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Potassium
decomposes water with great ease at the ordinary temperature, evolving
45,000 heat units per atomic weight in grams. The heat evolved is
sufficient to inflame the hydrogen, the flame being coloured violet from
the presence of particles of potassium.<a name="FNanchor_21_800" id="FNanchor_21_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_800" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the relation of potassium to hydrogen and oxygen,
it is closely analogous to sodium in this respect. Thus, with hydrogen
it forms potassium hydride, K<sub>2</sub>H (between 200° and 411°), and with
oxygen it gives a suboxide K<sub>4</sub>O, oxide K<sub>2</sub>O, and peroxide, only more
oxygen enters into the composition of the latter than in sodium peroxide;
potassium peroxide contains KO<sub>2</sub>, but it is probable that in the
combustion of potassium an oxide KO is also formed. Potassium,
like sodium, is soluble in mercury.<a name="FNanchor_22_801" id="FNanchor_22_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_801" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In a word, the relation between
sodium and potassium is as close as that between chlorine and bromine,
or, better still, between fluorine and chlorine, as the atomic weight of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">[560]</a></span>
sodium, 23, is as much greater than that of fluorine, 19, as that of
potassium, 39, is greater than that of chlorine, 35·5.</p>

<p>The resemblance between <i>potassium</i> and <i>sodium</i> is so great that
<i>their compounds</i> can only be easily <i>distinguished</i> in the form of certain
of their salts. For instance, the acid potassium tartrate, C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>5</sub>KO<sub>6</sub>
(cream of tartar), is distinguished by its sparing solubility in water and
in alcohol, and in a solution of tartaric acid, whilst the corresponding
sodium salt is easily soluble. Therefore, if a solution of tartaric acid
be added in considerable excess to the solutions of the majority of
potassium salts, a precipitate of the sparingly-soluble acid salt is
formed, which does not occur with salts of sodium. The chlorides KCl
and NaCl in solutions easily give double salts K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>,
with platinic chloride, PtCl<sub>4</sub>, and the solubility of these salts is very
different, especially in a mixture of alcohol and ether. The sodium salt
is easily soluble, whilst the potassium salt is insoluble or almost so, and
therefore the reaction with platinic chloride is that most often used
for the separation of potassium from sodium, as is more fully described
in works on analytical chemistry.</p>

<p>It is possible to discover the least traces of these metals in admixture
together, by means of their property of imparting different colours
to <i>a flame</i>. The presence of a salt of sodium in a flame is recognised
by a brilliant yellow coloration, and a pure potassium salt colours a
colourless flame violet. However, in the presence of a sodium salt
the pale violet coloration given by a potassium salt is quite undistinguishable,
and it is at first sight impossible in this case to discover the
potassium salt in the presence of that of sodium. But by decomposing
the light given by a flame coloured by these metals or a mixture of
them, by means of a prism, they are both easily distinguishable, because
the yellow light emitted by the sodium salt depends on a group of light
rays having a definite index of refraction which corresponds with the
yellow portion of the solar spectrum, having the index of refraction
of the Fraunhofer line (strictly speaking, group of lines) D, whilst the
salts of potassium give a light from which these rays are entirely absent,
but which contain rays of a red and violet colour. Therefore, if a
potassium salt occur in a flame, on decomposing the light (after passing
it through a narrow slit) by means of a prism, there will be seen red
and violet bands of light situated at a considerable distance from each
other; whilst if a sodium salt be present a yellow line will also appear.
If both metals simultaneously occur in a flame and emit light, the
spectrum lines corresponding to the potassium and the sodium will
appear simultaneously.</p>

<p>For convenience in carrying on this kind of testing, <i>spectroscopes</i>
(fig. <a href="#fig_72">72</a>) are constructed,<a name="FNanchor_23_802" id="FNanchor_23_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_802" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> consisting of a refracting prism and three
tubes placed in the plane of the refracting angle of the prism. One
of the tubes, C, has a vertical slit at the end, giving access to the light
to be tested, which then passes into the tube (collimator), containing a
lens which gives the rays a parallel direction. The rays of light having
passed through the slit, and having become parallel, are refracted and dispersed
in the prism, and the spectrum formed is observed through the
eye-piece of the other telescope
B. The third tube
D contains a horizontal
transparent scale (at the
outer end) which is
divided into equal divisions.
The light from a
source such as a gas
burner or candle placed
before this tube, passes
through the scale, and
is reflected on that face
of the prism which stands
before the telescope B,
so that the image of
the scale is seen through
this telescope simultaneously
with the spectrum
given by the rays
passing through the
slit of the tube C. In
this manner the image of the scale and the spectrum given by the
source of light under investigation are seen simultaneously. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">[562]</a></span>
sun's rays be directed through the slit of the tube C, then the observer
looking through the eye-piece of B will see the solar spectrum,
and (if the aperture of the slit be narrow and the apparatus correctly
adjusted) the dark Fraunhofer lines in it.<a name="FNanchor_24_803" id="FNanchor_24_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_803" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Small-sized
spectroscopes are usually so adjusted that (looking through B) the
violet portion of the spectrum is seen to the right and the red portion
to the left, and the Fraunhofer line D (in the bright yellow portion of
the spectrum) is situated on the 50th division of the scale.<a name="FNanchor_25_804" id="FNanchor_25_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_804" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> If the
light emitted by an incandescent solid&mdash;for example, the Drummond
light&mdash;be passed through the spectroscope, then all the colours of the
solar spectrum are seen, but not the Fraunhofer lines. To observe
the result given by a flame coloured by various salts a Bunsen gas
burner (or the pale flame of hydrogen gas issuing from a platinum
orifice) giving so pale a flame that its spectrum will be practically invisible
is placed before the slit. If any compound of sodium be placed in the
flame of the gas burner (for which purpose a platinum wire on whose end
sodium chloride is fused is fixed to the stand), then the flame is coloured
yellow, and on looking through the spectroscope the observer will see a
bright <i>yellow</i> line falling upon the 50th division of the scale, which is
seen together with the spectrum in the telescope. No yellow lines
of other refractive index, nor any rays of any other colour, will be
seen, and, therefore, the spectrum corresponding with sodium compounds
consists of yellow rays of that index of refraction which belong
to the Fraunhofer (black) line D of the solar spectrum. If a potassium
salt be introduced into the flame instead of a sodium salt, then two
bands will be seen which are much feebler than the bright sodium
band&mdash;namely, one red line near the Fraunhofer line A and another
violet line. Besides which, a pale, almost continuous, spectrum will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">[563]</a></span>
observed in the central portions of the scale. If a mixture of sodium
and potassium salts be now introduced into the flame, three lines
will be seen simultaneously&mdash;namely, the red and pale violet lines of
potassium and the yellow line of sodium. In this manner it is possible,
by the aid of the spectroscope, to determine the relation between the
spectra of metals and known portions of the solar spectrum. The continuity
of the latter is interrupted by dark lines (that is, by an absence
of light of a definite index of refraction), termed the Fraunhofer lines
of the solar spectrum. It has been shown by careful observations (by
Fraunhofer, Brewster, Foucault, Ångstrom, Kirchhoff, Cornu, Lockyer,
Dewar, and others) that there exists an exact <i>agreement between the
spectra</i> of certain <i>metals</i> and certain of the <i>Fraunhofer</i> lines. Thus the
bright yellow sodium line exactly corresponds with the dark Fraunhofer
line D of the solar spectrum. A similar agreement is observed
in the case of many other metals. This is not an approximate or chance
correlation. In fact, if a spectroscope having a large number of refracting
prisms and a high magnifying power be used, it is seen
that the dark line D of the solar spectrum consists of an entire system
of closely adjacent but definitely situated fine and wide (sharp, distinct)
dark lines,<a name="FNanchor_26_805" id="FNanchor_26_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_805" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and an exactly similar group of bright lines is obtained
when the yellow sodium line is examined through the same apparatus,
so that each bright sodium line exactly corresponds with a dark line in
the solar spectrum.<a name="FNanchor_26_BIS_806" id="FNanchor_26_BIS_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_BIS_806" class="fnanchor">[26 bis]</a> This conformity of the bright lines formed by
sodium with the dark lines of the solar spectrum cannot be accidental.
This conclusion is further confirmed by the fact that the bright lines
of other metals correspond with dark lines of the solar spectrum.
Thus, for example, a series of sparks passing between the iron electrodes
of a Ruhmkorff coil gives 450 very distinct lines characterising this
metal. All these 450 bright lines, constituting the whole spectrum corresponding
with iron, are repeated, as Kirchhoff showed, in the solar
spectrum as dark Fraunhofer lines which occur in exactly the same situations
as the bright lines in the iron spectrum, just as the sodium lines
correspond with the band D in the solar spectrum. Many observers
have in this manner studied the solar spectrum and the spectra of
different metals simultaneously, and discovered in the former lines which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">[564]</a></span>
correspond not only with sodium and iron, but also with many other
metals.<a name="FNanchor_27_807" id="FNanchor_27_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_807" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The spectra of such elements as hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
and other gases may be observed in the so-called Geissler's tubes&mdash;that
is, in glass tubes containing rarefied gases, through which the discharge
of a Ruhmkorff's coil is passed. Thus hydrogen gives a spectrum composed
of three lines&mdash;a red line corresponding with the Fraunhofer line
C, a green line corresponding with the line F, and a violet line corresponding
with one of the lines between G and H. Of these rays the
red is the brightest, and therefore the general colour of luminous
hydrogen (with an electric discharge through a Geissler tube) is reddish.</p>

<p>The correlation of the Fraunhofer lines with the spectra of metals
depends on the phenomenon of the so-called <i>reversal of the spectrum</i>. This
phenomenon consists in this, that instead of the bright spectrum corresponding
with a metal, under certain circumstances a similar dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">[565]</a></span>
spectrum in the form of Fraunhofer lines may be obtained, as will be
explained directly. In order to clearly understand the phenomenon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">[566]</a></span>
reversed spectra, it must be known that when light passes through
certain transparent substances these substances retain rays of a certain
refrangibility. The colour of solutions is a proof of this. Light which
has passed through a yellow solution of a uranium salt contains no
violet rays, and after having passed through a red solution of a permanganate,
does not contain many rays in the yellow, blue, and green
portions of the spectrum. Solutions of copper salts absorb nearly all
red rays. Sometimes colourless solutions also absorb rays of certain
definite refractive indexes, and give <i>absorption spectra</i>. Thus solutions
of salts of didymium absorb rays of a certain refrangibility,
and therefore an impression of black lines is received,<a name="FNanchor_28_808" id="FNanchor_28_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_808" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> as shown in
fig. <a href="#fig_73">73</a>. Many vapours (iodine) and gases (nitric peroxide) give similar
spectra. Light which has passed through a deep layer of aqueous
vapour, oxygen, or nitrogen also gives an absorption spectrum. For
this reason the peculiar (winter) dark lines discovered by Brewster are
observed in sunlight, especially in the evening and morning, when the
sun's rays pass through the atmosphere (containing these substances)
by a longer path than at mid-day. It is evident that the Fraunhofer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">[567]</a></span>
lines may be ascribed to the absorption of certain rays of light in its
passage from the luminous mass of the sun to the earth. The remarkable
progress made in all spectroscopic research dates from the investigations
made by <i>Kirchhoff</i> (1859) on the relation between absorption
spectra and the spectra of luminous incandescent gases. It had already
been observed long before (by Fraunhofer, Foucault, Ångstrom) that
the bright spectrum of the sodium flame gives two bright lines which
are in exactly the same position as two black lines known as D in
the solar spectrum, which evidently belong to an absorption spectrum.
When Kirchhoff caused diffused sunlight to fall upon the slit of a
spectroscope, and placed a sodium flame before it, a perfect superposition
was observed&mdash;the bright sodium lines completely covered
the black lines D of the solar spectrum. When further the continuous
spectrum of a Drummond light showed the black line D on placing
a sodium flame between it and the slit of the spectroscope&mdash;that
is, when the Fraunhofer line of the solar spectrum was artificially produced&mdash;then
there was no doubt that its appearance in the solar spectrum
was due to the light passing somewhere through incandescent vapours
of sodium. Hence a new theory of <i>reversed spectra</i><a name="FNanchor_29_809" id="FNanchor_29_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_809" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> arose&mdash;that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">[568]</a></span>
of the relation between the waves of light emitted and absorbed by a
substance under given conditions of temperature; this is expressed
by Kirchhoff's law, discovered by a careful analysis of the phenomena.
This law may be formulated in an elementary way as follows: At a
given temperature the relation between the intensity of the light emitted
(of a definite wave-length) and the absorptive capacity with respect to the
same colour (of the same wave-length) is a constant quantity.<a name="FNanchor_30_810" id="FNanchor_30_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_810" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> As a
black dull surface emits and also absorbs a considerable quantity of heat
rays whilst a polished metallic surface both absorbs and emits but few,
so a flame coloured by sodium emits a considerable quantity of yellow
rays of a definite refrangibility, and has the property of absorbing a
considerable quantity of the rays of the same refractive index. In
general, the medium which emits definite rays also absorbs them.</p>

<p>Thus the bright spectral rays characteristic of a given metal may
be reversed&mdash;that is, converted into dark lines&mdash;by passing light which
gives a continuous spectrum through a space containing the heated
vapours of the given metal. A similar phenomenon to that thus artificially
produced is observed in sunlight, which shows dark lines
characteristic of known metals&mdash;that is, the Fraunhofer lines form an
absorption spectrum or depend on a reversed spectrum; it being presupposed
that the sun itself, like all known sources of artificial light,
gives a continuous spectrum without Fraunhofer lines.<a name="FNanchor_31_811" id="FNanchor_31_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_811" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">[569]</a></span>
imagine that the sun, owing to the high temperature which is proper to it,
emits a brilliant light which gives a continuous spectrum, and that this
light, before reaching our eyes, passes through a space full of the vapours
of different metals and their compounds. As the earth's atmosphere<a name="FNanchor_32_812" id="FNanchor_32_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_812" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
contains very little, or no, metallic vapours, and as they cannot be supposed
to exist in the celestial space,<a name="FNanchor_32_BIS_813" id="FNanchor_32_BIS_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_BIS_813" class="fnanchor">[32 bis]</a> the only place in which
the existence of such vapours can be admitted is in the <i>atmosphere
surrounding the sun itself</i>. As the cause of the sun's luminosity must
be looked for in its high temperature, the existence of an atmosphere
containing metallic vapours is readily understood, because at that
high temperature such metals as sodium, and even iron, are separated
from their compounds and converted into vapour. The sun must
be imagined as surrounded by an atmosphere of incandescent vaporous
and gaseous matter,<a name="FNanchor_33_814" id="FNanchor_33_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_814" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> including those elements whose reversed spectra
correspond with the Fraunhofer lines&mdash;namely, sodium, iron, hydrogen,
lithium, calcium, magnesium, &amp;c. Thus in spectrum analysis we find
a means of determining the composition of the inaccessible heavenly
luminaries, and much has been done in this respect since Kirchhoff's
theory was formulated. By observations on the spectra of many
heavenly bodies, changes have been discovered going on in them,<a name="FNanchor_34_815" id="FNanchor_34_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_815" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">[570]</a></span>
many of the elements known to us have been found with certainty in
them.<a name="FNanchor_35_816" id="FNanchor_35_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_816" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> From this it must be concluded that the same elements which
exist on the earth occur throughout the whole universe, and that at
that degree of heat which is proper to the sun those simple substances
which we accept as the elements in chemistry are still undecomposed
and remain unchanged. A high temperature forms one of those
conditions under which compounds most easily decompose; and
if sodium or a similar element were a compound, in all probability
it would be decomposed into component parts at the high temperature
of the sun. This may indeed be concluded from the fact that
in ordinary spectroscopic experiments the spectra obtained often
belong to the metals and not to the compounds taken; this depends
on the decomposition of these compounds in the heat of the flame. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">[571]</a></span>
common salt be introduced into the flame of a gas-burner, a portion of
it is decomposed, first forming, in all probability, with water, hydrochloric
acid and sodium hydroxide, and the latter then becoming partially
decomposed by the hydrocarbons, giving metallic sodium, whose incandescent
vapour emits light of a definite refrangibility. This conclusion
is arrived at from the following experiment:&mdash;If hydrochloric acid gas
be introduced into a flame coloured by sodium it is observed that the
sodium spectrum disappears, owing to the fact that metallic sodium
cannot remain in the flame in the presence of an excess of hydrochloric
acid. The same thing takes place on the addition of sal-ammoniac,
which in the heat of the flame gives hydrochloric acid. If a porcelain
tube containing sodium chloride (or sodium hydroxide or carbonate), and
closed at both ends by glass plates, be so powerfully heated that the
salt volatilises, then the sodium spectrum is not observable; but if the
salt be replaced by sodium, then either the bright line or the absorption
spectra is obtained, according to whether the light emitted by the
incandescent vapour be observed, or light passing through the
tube. Thus the above spectrum is not given by sodium chloride or
other sodium compound, but is proper to the metal sodium itself. This
is also the case with other analogous metals. The chlorides and other
halogen <i>compounds</i> of barium, calcium, copper, &amp;c., give independent
spectra which differ from those of the metals. If barium chloride be
introduced into a flame, it gives a mixed spectrum belonging to metallic
barium and barium chloride. If besides barium chloride, hydrochloric
acid or sal-ammoniac be introduced into the flame, then the spectrum
of the metal disappears, and that of the chloride remains, which differs
distinctly from the spectrum of barium fluoride, barium bromide, or
barium iodide. A certain common resemblance and certain common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">[572]</a></span>
lines are observed in the spectra of two different compounds of one and
the same element obtained in the above-described manner, and also in
the spectrum of the metal, but they all have their peculiarities. The
independent spectra of the compounds of copper are easily observed
(fig. <a href="#fig_75">75</a>). Thus certain compounds which exist in a state of vapour, and
are luminous at a high temperature, give their independent spectra.
In the majority of cases the spectra of compounds are composed of
indistinct luminous lines and complete bright bands, whilst metallic
elements generally give a few clearly-defined spectral lines.<a name="FNanchor_36_817" id="FNanchor_36_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_817" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">[573]</a></span>
no reason for supposing that the spectrum of a compound is equal to
the sum of the spectra of its elements&mdash;that is, <i>every compound</i> which
is not decomposed by heat <i>has its own proper spectrum</i>. This is best
proved by absorption spectra, which are essentially only reversed spectra
observed at low temperatures. If every salt of sodium, lithium, and
potassium gives one and the same spectrum, this must be ascribed
to the presence in the flame of the free metals liberated by the
decomposition of their salts. Therefore <i>the phenomena of the spectrum
are determined by molecules, and not by atoms</i>&mdash;that is, the molecules
of the metal sodium, and not its atoms, produce those particular
vibrations which determine the spectrum of a sodium salt. Where
there is no free metallic sodium there is no sodium spectrum.</p>

<p><i>Spectrum analysis</i> has not only endowed science with a knowledge
of the composition of distant heavenly bodies (of the sun, stars,
nebulæ, comets, &amp;c.), but has also given a new <i>method</i> for studying
the matter of the earth's surface. With its help Bunsen discovered
two new elements belonging to the group of the alkali metals, and
thallium, indium, and gallium were afterwards discovered by the same
means. The spectroscope is employed in the study of rare metals
(which in solution often give distinct absorption spectra), of dyes,
and of many organic substances, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_37_818" id="FNanchor_37_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_818" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> With respect to the metals
which are analogous to sodium, they all give similar very volatile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">[574]</a></span>
salts and such very characteristic spectra that the least traces of
them<a name="FNanchor_38_819" id="FNanchor_38_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_819" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> are discovered with great ease by means of the spectroscope.
For instance, <i>lithium</i> gives a very brilliant red coloration to a flame
and a very bright red spectral line (wave-length, 670 millionths mm.),
which indicates the presence of this metal in admixture with compounds
of other alkali metals.</p>

action of a galvanic current on fused
lithium chloride.</p></div>

<p><i>Lithium</i>, Li, is, like potassium and sodium, somewhat widely spread
in siliceous rocks, but only occurs in small quantities and as mere traces
in considerable masses of potassium and sodium salts. Only a very
few rather rare minerals contain more than traces of it,<a name="FNanchor_39_820" id="FNanchor_39_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_820" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> for example,
spodumene and lithia mica. Many compounds of lithium are in all
respects closely analogous to the corresponding compounds of sodium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">[575]</a></span>
and potassium; but the <i>carbonate</i> is sparingly soluble in cold water,
which fact is taken advantage of for separating lithium from potassium
and sodium. This salt, Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is easily converted into the other
compounds of lithium. Thus, for instance, the lithium hydroxide,
LiHO, is obtained in exactly the same way as caustic soda, by the
action of lime on the carbonate, and it is soluble in water and
crystallises (from its solution in alcohol) as LiHO,H<sub>2</sub>O. Metallic
<i>lithium</i> is obtained by the action of a galvanic current on fused
lithium chloride; for this purpose a cast-iron crucible, furnished
with a stout cover, is filled with lithium chloride, heated until the
latter fuses, and a strong galvanic current is then passed through the
molten mass. The positive pole (fig. <a href="#fig_77">77</a>)
consists of a dense carbon rod C (surrounded
by a porcelain tube P fixed in an
iron tube BB), and the negative pole of
an iron wire, on which the metal is
deposited after the current has passed
through the molten mass for a certain
length of time. Chlorine is evolved at the
positive pole. When a somewhat considerable
quantity of the metal has accumulated
on the wire it is withdrawn, the metal is
collected from it, and the experiment is
then carried on as before.<a name="FNanchor_39_BIS_821" id="FNanchor_39_BIS_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_BIS_821" class="fnanchor">[39 bis]</a> Lithium is the lightest of all metals, its
specific gravity is 0·59, owing to which it floats even on naphtha; it
melts at 180°, but does not volatilise at a red heat. Its appearance
recalls that of sodium, and, like it, it has a yellow tint. At 200°
it burns in air with a very bright flame, forming lithium oxide. In
decomposing water it does not ignite the hydrogen. The characteristic
test for lithium compounds is the <i>red coloration</i> which they impart to
a colourless flame.<a name="FNanchor_40_822" id="FNanchor_40_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_822" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p>Bunsen in 1860 tried to determine by means of the spectroscope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">[576]</a></span>
whether any other as yet unknown metals might not occur in different
natural products together with lithium, potassium, and sodium, and he
soon discovered two new alkali metals showing independent spectra.
They are named after the characteristic coloration which they impart to
the flame. One which gives a red and violet band is named <i>rubidium</i>,
from <i>rubidius</i> (dark red), and the other is called <i>cæsium</i>, because it
colours a pale flame sky blue, which depends on its containing bright
blue rays, which appear in the spectrum of cæsium as two blue bands
(table on p. 565). Both metals accompany sodium, potassium, and
lithium, but in small quantities; rubidium occurs in larger quantity
than cæsium. The amount of the oxides of cæsium and rubidium in
lepidolite does not generally exceed one-half per cent. Rubidium has also
been found in the ashes of many plants, while the Stassfurt carnallite
(the mother-liquor obtained after having been treated for KCl) forms
an abundant source for rubidium and also partly for cæsium.
Rubidium also occurs, although in very small quantities, in the majority
of mineral waters. In a very few cases cæsium is not accompanied by
rubidium; thus, in a certain granite on the Isle of Elba, cæsium has
been discovered, but not rubidium. This granite contains a very rare
mineral called <i>pollux</i>, which contains as much as 34 per cent. of cæsium
oxide. Guided by the spectroscope, and aided by the fact that the
double salts of platinic chloride and rubidium and cæsium chlorides
are still less soluble in water than the corresponding potassium salt,
K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_41_823" id="FNanchor_41_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_823" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Bunsen succeeded in separating both metals from each
other and from potassium, and demonstrated the great resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">[577]</a></span>
they bear to each other. The isolated metals,<a name="FNanchor_42_824" id="FNanchor_42_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_824" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> rubidium and cæsium,
have respectively the specific gravities 1·52 and 2·366, and melting
points 39° and 27° as N. N. Beketoff showed (1894), he having obtained
cæsium by heating CsAlO<sub>2</sub> with Mg(<a name="FNanchor_42_BIS_825" id="FNanchor_42_BIS_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_BIS_825" class="fnanchor">[42 bis]</a>).</p>

<p>Judging by the properties of the free metals, and of their corresponding
and even very complex compounds, lithium, sodium, potassium,
rubidium, and cæsium present an indubitable chemical resemblance.
The fact that the metals easily decompose water, and that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">[578]</a></span>
hydroxides RHO and carbonates R<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> are soluble in water, whilst the
hydroxides and carbonates of nearly all other metals are insoluble, shows
that these metals form a natural group of <i>alkali metals</i>. The halogens
and the alkali metals form, by their character, the two extremes of the
elements. Many of the other elements are metals approaching the
alkali metals, both in their capacity of forming salts and in not forming
acid compounds, but are not so energetic as the alkali metals, that is,
they form less energetic bases. Such are the common metals, silver,
iron, copper, &amp;c. Some other elements, in the character of their compounds,
approach the halogens, and, like them, combine with hydrogen,
but these compounds do not show the energetic property of the halogen
acids; in a free state they easily combine with metals, but they do not
then form such saline compounds as the halogens do&mdash;in a word, the
halogen properties are less sharply defined in them than in the halogens
themselves. Sulphur, phosphorus, arsenic, &amp;c. belong to this order
of elements. The clearest distinction of the properties of the halogens
and alkali metals is expressed in the fact that the former give acids
and do not form bases, whilst the latter, on the contrary, only give
bases. The first are true <i>acid elements</i>, the latter clearly-defined <i>basic
or metallic elements</i>. On combining together, the halogens form, in a
chemical sense, unstable compounds, and the alkali metals alloys in
which the character of the metals remains unaltered, just as in the
compound ICl the character of the halogens remains undisguised; thus
both classes of elements on combining with members of their own class
form non-characteristic compounds, which have the properties of their
components. On the other hand, the halogens on combining with the
alkali metals form compounds which are, in all respects, stable, and in
which the original characters of the halogens and alkali metals have
entirely disappeared. The formation of such compounds is accompanied
by evolution of a large amount of heat, and by an entire change of both
the physical and chemical properties of the substances originally taken.
The alloy of sodium and potassium, although liquid at the ordinary
temperature, is perfectly metallic, like both its components. The
compound of sodium and chlorine has neither the appearance nor the
properties of the original elements; sodium chloride melts at a higher
temperature, and is more difficultly volatile, than either sodium or
chlorine.</p>

<p>With all these qualitative differences there is, however, an important
quantitative <i>resemblance between the halogens and the alkali metals</i>.
This resemblance is clearly expressed by stating that both orders of
elements belong to those which are univalent with respect to hydrogen.
It is thus correct to say that both the above-named orders of elements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">[579]</a></span>
replace hydrogen atom for atom. Chlorine is able to take the
place of hydrogen by metalepsis, and the alkali metals take the place
of hydrogen in water and acids. As it is possible to consecutively replace
every equivalent of hydrogen in a hydrocarbon by chlorine, so it
is possible in an acid containing several equivalents of hydrogen to
replace the hydrogen consecutively equivalent after equivalent by
an alkali metal; hence an atom of these elements is analogous to an
atom of hydrogen, which is taken, in all cases, as the unit for the
comparison of the other elements. In ammonia, and in water, chlorine
and sodium are able to bring about a direct replacement. According
to the law of substitution, the formation of sodium chloride, NaCl,
at once shows the equivalence of the atoms of the alkali metals and the
halogens. The halogens and hydrogen and the alkali metals combine
with such elements as oxygen, and it is easily proved that in such compounds
one atom of oxygen is able to retain two atoms of the halogens,
of hydrogen, and of the alkali metals. For this purpose it is enough to
compare the compounds KHO, K<sub>2</sub>O, HClO, and Cl<sub>2</sub>O, with water. It
must not be forgotten, however, that the halogens give, with oxygen,
besides compounds of the type R<sub>2</sub>O, higher acid grades of oxidation,
which the alkali metals and hydrogen are not capable of forming. We
shall soon see that these relations are also subject to a special law,
showing a gradual transition of the properties of the elements from
the alkali metals to the halogens.<a name="FNanchor_43_826" id="FNanchor_43_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_826" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The atomic weights of the alkali metals, lithium 7, sodium 23,
potassium 39, rubidium 85, and cæsium 133, show that here, as in the
class of halogens, the elements may be arranged according to their
atomic weights in order to compare the properties of the analogous
compounds of the members of this group. Thus, for example, the
platinochlorides of lithium and sodium are soluble in water; those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">[580]</a></span>
of potassium, rubidium, and cæsium sparingly soluble, and the greater
the atomic weight of the metal the less soluble is the salt. In other
cases the reverse is observed&mdash;the greater the atomic weight the more
soluble are the corresponding salts. The variation of properties with
the variation in atomic weights even shows itself in the metals themselves;
thus lithium volatilises with difficulty, whilst sodium is obtained
by distillation, potassium volatilises more easily than sodium, and
rubidium and cæsium as we have seen, are still more volatile.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_775" id="Footnote_1_775"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_775"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Tutton's researches (1894) upon the analogy of the crystalline forms of K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, Rb<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
and Cs<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> may be taken as a typical example of the comparison of analogous compounds.
We cite the following data from these excellent researches: the sp. gr. at 20°/4° of K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
is 2·6633 of Rb<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 3·6113, and of Cs<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 4·2434. The coefficient of cubical expansion
(the mean between 20° and 60°) for the K salt is 0·0053, for the Rb salt 0·0052, for the
Cs salt 0·0051. The linear expansion (the maximum for the vertical axis) along the axis
of crystallisation is the same for all three salts, within the limits of experimental error.
The replacement of potassium by rubidium causes the distance between the centres of
the molecules in the direction of the three axes of crystallisation to increase equally, and
less than with the replacement of rubidium by cæsium. The index of refraction for all
rays and for every crystalline path (direction) is greater for the rubidium salt than for
the potassium salt, and less than for the cæsium salt, and the differences are nearly in
the ratio 2 : 5. The lengths of the rhombic crystalline axes for K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are in the ratio
0·5727 : 1 : 0·7418, for Rb<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0·5723 : 1 : 0·7485, and for Cs<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 0·5712 : 1 : 0·7521.
The development of the basic and brachy-pinacoids gradually increases in passing from
K to Rb and Cs. The optical properties also follow the same order both at the ordinary
and at a higher temperature. Tutton draws the general conclusion that the crystallographic
properties of the isomorphic rhombic sulphates R<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are a function of the
atomic weight of the metals contained in them (<i>see</i> Chapter XV.) Such researches as
these should do much towards hastening the establishment of a true molecular mechanics
of physico-chemical phenomena.</p></div>

<p>When mixed with solutions of other salts the solubility of potassium chloride naturally
varies, but not to any great extent.</p></div>

<p>Potassium chloride combines with iodine trichloride to form a compound KCl + ICl<sub>3</sub>
= KICl<sub>4</sub>, which has a yellow colour, is fusible, loses iodine trichloride at a red heat,
and gives potassium iodate and hydrochloric acid with water. It is not only formed by
direct combination, but also by many other methods; for instance, by passing chlorine
into a solution of potassium iodide so long as the gas is absorbed, KI + 2Cl<sub>2</sub> = KCl,ICl<sub>3</sub>.
Potassium iodide, when treated with potassium chlorate and strong hydrochloric acid,
also gives this compound; another method for its formation is given by the equation
KClO<sub>3</sub> + I + 6HCl = KCl,ICl<sub>3</sub> + 3Cl + 3H<sub>2</sub>O. This is a kind of salt corresponding with
KIO<sub>2</sub> (unknown) in which the oxygen is replaced by chlorine. If valency be taken as
the starting-point in the study of chemical compounds, and the elements considered as
having a constant atomicity (number of bonds)&mdash;that is, if K, Cl, and I be taken as
univalent elements&mdash;then it is impossible to explain the formation of such a compound
because, according to this view, univalent elements are only able to form dual compounds
with each other; such as, KCl, ClI, KI, &amp;c., whilst here they are grouped
together in the molecule KICl<sub>4</sub>. Wells, Wheeler, and Penfield (1892) obtained a large
number of such poly-haloid salts. They may all be divided into two large classes:
the tri-haloid and the penta-haloid salts. They have been obtained not only for K
but also for Rb and Cs, and partially also for Na and Li. The general method of their
formation consists in dissolving the ordinary halogen salt of the metal in water, and
treating it with the requisite amount of free halogen. The poly-haloid salt separates
out after evaporating the solution at a more or less low temperature. In this manner,
among the tri-haloid salts, may be obtained: KI<sub>3</sub>, KBr<sub>2</sub>I, KCl<sub>2</sub>I, and the corresponding
salts of rubidium and cæsium, for instance, CsI<sub>3</sub>, CsBrI<sub>2</sub>, CsBr<sub>2</sub>I, CsClBrI,CsCl<sub>2</sub>I,
CsBr<sub>3</sub>, CsClBr<sub>2</sub>, CsCl<sub>2</sub>Br, and in general MX<sub>3</sub> where X is a halogen. The colour of the
crystals varies according to the halogen, thus CsI<sub>3</sub> is black, CrBr<sub>3</sub> yellowish red, CrBrI<sub>2</sub>
reddish brown, CsBr<sub>2</sub>I red, CsCl<sub>2</sub>Br yellow. The cæsium salts are the most stable, and
those of potassium least so, as also those which contain Br and I separately or together;
for cæsium no compounds containing Cl and I were obtained. The penta-haloid salts form
a smaller class; among these salts potassium forms KCl<sub>4</sub>I, rubidium RbCl<sub>4</sub>I, cæsium
CsI<sub>5</sub>, CsBr, CsCl<sub>4</sub>I, lithium LiCl<sub>4</sub>I (with 4H<sub>2</sub>O) and sodium NaCl<sub>4</sub>I (with 2H<sub>2</sub>O). The
most stable are those salts containing the metal with the greatest atomic weight&mdash;cæsium
(<i>see</i> Chapter XI., Note <a href="#Footnote_63_689">63</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_780" id="Footnote_4_780"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_780"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> It is possible to extract the compounds of potassium directly from the primary
rocks which are so widely distributed over the earth's surface and so abundant in some
localities. From a chemical point of view this problem presents no difficulty; for instance,
by fusing powdered orthoclase with lime and fluor spar (Ward's method) and
then extracting the alkali with water (on fusion the silica gives an insoluble compound
with lime), or by treating the orthoclase with hydrofluoric acid (in which case
silicon fluoride is evolved as a gas) it is possible to transfer the alkali of the orthoclase
to an aqueous solution, and to separate it in this manner from the other insoluble oxides.
However, as yet there is no profit in, nor necessity for, recourse to this treatment, as
carnallite and potash form abundant materials for the extraction of potassium compounds
by cheaper methods. Furthermore, the salts of potassium are now in the majority of
chemical reactions replaced by salts of sodium, especially since the preparation of sodium
carbonate has been facilitated by the Leblanc process. The replacement of potassium
compounds by sodium compounds not only has the advantage that the salts of sodium
are in general cheaper than those of potassium, but also that a smaller quantity of a
sodium salt is needed for a given reaction than of a potassium salt, because the combining
weight of sodium (23) is less than that of potassium (39).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_781" id="Footnote_5_781"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_781"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> It has been shown by direct experiment on the cultivation of plants in artificial
soils and in solutions that under conditions (physical, chemical, and physiological) otherwise
identical plants are able to thrive and become fully developed in the entire absence
of sodium salts, but that their development is impossible without potassium salts.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_782" id="Footnote_6_782"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_782"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> If herbaceous plants contain much sodium salts, it is evident that these salts mainly
come from the sodium compounds in the water absorbed by the plants.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_783" id="Footnote_7_783"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_783"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> As plants always contain mineral substances and cannot thrive in a medium which
does not contain them, more especially in one which is free from the salts of the four
basic oxides, K<sub>2</sub>O, CaO, MgO, and Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and of the four acid oxides, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>,
P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, and SO<sub>3</sub>, and as the amount of ash-forming substances in plants is small, the
question inevitably arises as to what part these play in the development of plants.
With the existing chemical data only one answer is possible to this question, and it is
still only a hypothesis. This answer was particularly clearly expressed by Professor
Gustavson of the Petroffsky Agricultural Academy. Starting from the fact (Chapter
XI., Note <a href="#Footnote_55_681">55</a>) that a small quantity of aluminium renders possible or facilitates the
reaction of bromine on hydrocarbons at the ordinary temperature, it is easy to arrive at
the conclusion, which is very probable and in accordance with many data respecting the
reactions of organic compounds, that the addition of mineral substances to organic compounds
lowers the temperature of reaction and in general facilitates chemical reactions
in plants, and thus aids the conversion of the most simple nourishing substances into the
complex component parts of the plant organism. The province of chemical reactions
proceeding in organic substances in the presence of a small quantity of mineral substances
has as yet been but little investigated, although there are already several disconnected
data concerning reactions of this kind, and although a great deal is known with regard
to such reactions among inorganic compounds. The essence of the matter may be expressed
thus&mdash;two substances, A and B, do not react on each other of their own accord,
but the addition of a small quantity of a third particularly active substance, C, produces
the reaction of A on B, because A combines with C, forming AC, and B reacts on this new
compound, which has a different store of chemical energy, forming the compound AB or
its products, and setting C free again or retaining it.</p>

<p>It may here be remarked that all the mineral substances necessary for plants (those
enumerated at the beginning of the note) are the highest saline compounds of their
elements, that they enter into the plants as salts, that the lower forms of oxidation of the
same elements (for instance, sulphites and phosphites) are harmful to plants (poisonous),
and that strong solutions of the salts assimilated by plants (their osmotic pressure being
great and contracting the cells, as De Vries showed, (<i>see</i> Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>)) not only
do not enter into the plants but kill them (poison them).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_784" id="Footnote_8_784"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_784"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Besides which, it will be understood from the preceding paragraph that the salts of
potassium may become exhausted from the soil by long cultivation, and that there may
therefore be cases when the direct fertilisation by salts of potassium may be profitable.
But manure and animal excrements, ashes, and, in general, nearly all refuse which may
serve for fertilising the soil, contain a considerable quantity of potassium salts, and
therefore, as regards the natural salts of potassium (Stassfurt), and especially potassium
sulphate, if they often improve the crops, it is in all probability due to their action
on the properties of the soil. The agriculturist cannot therefore be advised to add
potassium salts, without making special experiments showing the advantage of such a
fertiliser on a given kind of soil and plant.</p>

<p>The animal body also contains potassium compounds, which is natural, since animals
consume plants. For example, milk, and especially human milk, contains a somewhat considerable
quantity of potassium compounds. Cow's milk, however, does not contain much
potassium salt. Sodium compounds generally predominate in the bodies of animals. The
excrement of animals, and especially of herbivorous animals, on the contrary, often contains
a large proportion of potassium salts. Thus sheep's dung is rich in them, and in
washing sheep's wool salts of potassium pass into the water.</p>

<p>The ash of tree stems, as the already dormant portion of the plant (Chapter VIII.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_1_442">1</a>), contains little potash. For the extraction of potash, which was formerly carried
on extensively in the east of Russia (before the discovery of the Stassfurt salt), the ash
of grasses, and the green portions of potatoes, buckwheat, &amp;c., are taken and treated
with water (lixiviated), the solution is evaporated, and the residue ignited in order to
destroy the organic matter present in the extract. The residue thus obtained is composed
of raw potash. It is refined by a second dissolution in a small quantity of water,
for the potash itself is very soluble in water, whilst the impurities are sparingly soluble.
The solution thus obtained is again evaporated, and the residue ignited, and this
potash is then called refined potash, or pearlash. This method of treatment cannot
give chemically pure potassium carbonate. A certain amount of impurities remain.
To obtain chemically pure potassium carbonate, some other salt of potassium is generally
taken and purified by crystallisation. Potassium carbonate crystallises with difficulty,
and it cannot therefore be purified by this means, whilst other salts, such as the
tartrate, acid carbonate, sulphate, or nitrate, &amp;c., crystallise easily and may thus be
directly purified. The tartrate is most frequently employed, since it is prepared in large
quantities (as a sediment from wine) for medicinal use under the name of cream of tartar.
When ignited without access of air, it leaves a mixture of charcoal and potassium
carbonate. The charcoal so obtained being in a finely-divided condition, the mixture
(called &lsquo;black flux&rsquo;), is sometimes used for reducing metals from their oxides with the
aid of heat. A certain quantity of nitre is added to burn the charcoal formed by
heating the cream of tartar. Potassium carbonate thus prepared is further purified by
converting it into the acid salt, by passing a current of carbonic anhydride through
a strong solution. KHCO<sub>3</sub> is then formed, which is less soluble than the normal salt
(as is also the case with the corresponding sodium salts), and therefore crystals of the
acid salt separate from the solution on cooling. When ignited, they part with their
water and carbonic anhydride, and pure potassium carbonate remains behind. The
physical properties of potassium carbonate distinguish it sufficiently from sodium
carbonate; it is obtained from solutions as a powdery white mass, having an alkaline
taste and reaction, and, as a rule, shows only traces of crystallisation. It also attracts
the moisture of the air with great energy. The crystals do not contain water, but
absorb it from the air, deliquescing into a saturated solution. It melts at a red heat
(1045°), and at a still higher temperature is even converted into vapour, as has been
observed at glass works where it is employed. It is very soluble. At the ordinary
temperature, water dissolves an equal weight of the salt. Crystals containing two
equivalents of water separate from such a saturated solution when strongly cooled (Morel
obtained K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>3H<sub>2</sub>O in well-formed crystals at +10°). There is no necessity to describe
its reactions, because they are all analogous to those of sodium carbonate. When
manufactured sodium carbonate was but little known, the consumption of potassium
carbonate was very considerable, and even now washing soda is frequently replaced
for household purposes by &lsquo;lye&rsquo;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> an aqueous solution obtained from ashes.
It contains potassium carbonate, which acts like the sodium salt in washing tissues,
linen, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A mixture of potassium and sodium carbonates fuses with much greater ease than the
separate salts, and a mixture of their solutions gives well-crystallised salts&mdash;for instance
(Marguerite's salt), K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O,2Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O. Crystallisation also occurs in other
multiple proportions of K and Na (in the above case 1 : 2, but 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 are known),
and always with 6 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O. This is evidently a combination <i>by similarity</i>, as in alloys,
solutions, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_BIS_785" id="Footnote_8_BIS_785"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_BIS_785"><span class="label">[8 bis]</span></a> About 25,000 tons of potash annually are now prepared from KCl by this method
at Stassfurt.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_786" id="Footnote_9_786"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_786"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> <i>Potassium sulphate</i>, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, crystallises from its solutions in an anhydrous condition,
in which respect it differs from the corresponding sodium salt, just as potassium carbonate
differs from sodium carbonate. In general, it must be observed that the majority
of sodium salts combine more easily with water of crystallisation than the potassium
salts. The solubility of <i>potassium sulphate</i> does not show the same peculiarities as that
of sodium sulphate, because it does not combine with water of crystallisation; at the
ordinary temperature 100 parts of water dissolve about 10 parts of the salt, at 0° 8·3
parts, and at 100° about 26 parts. <i>The acid sulphate</i>, KHSO<sub>4</sub>, obtained easily by
heating crystals of the normal salt with sulphuric acid, is frequently employed in
chemical practice. On heating the mixture of acid and salt, fumes of sulphuric acid are
at first given off; when they cease to be evolved, the acid salt is contained in the residue.
At a higher temperature (of above 600°) the acid salt parts with all the acid contained in
it, the normal salt being re-formed. The definite composition of this acid salt, and the
ease with which it decomposes, render it exceedingly valuable for certain chemical transformations
accomplished by means of sulphuric acid at a high temperature, because it is
possible to take, in the form of this salt, a strictly definite quantity of sulphuric acid,
and to cause it to act on a given substance at a high temperature, which it is often
necessary to do, more especially in chemical analysis. In this case, the acid salt acts
in exactly the same manner as sulphuric acid itself, but the latter is inefficient at
temperatures above 400°, because it all evaporates, while at that temperature the acid
salt still remains in a fused state, and acts with the elements of sulphuric acid on the
substance taken. Hence by its means the boiling-point of sulphuric acid is raised.
Thus the acid potassium sulphate is employed, where for conversion of certain oxides,
such as those of iron, aluminium, and chromium, into salts, a high temperature is
required.</p>

<p>Weber, by heating potassium sulphate with an excess of sulphuric acid at 100°,
observed the formation of a lower stratum, which was found to contain a definite compound
containing eight equivalents of SO<sub>3</sub> per equivalent of K<sub>2</sub>O. The salts of
rubidium, cæsium, and thallium give a similar result, but those of sodium and lithium
do not. (<i>See</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_1_775">1</a>.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_787" id="Footnote_10_787"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_787"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> The <i>bromide</i> and <i>iodide</i> of potassium are used, like the corresponding sodium
compounds, in medicine and photography. Potassium iodide is easily obtained in a pure
state by saturating a solution of hydriodic acid with caustic potash. In practice, however,
this method is rarely had recourse to, other more simple processes being employed
although they do not give so pure a product. They aim at the direct formation
of hydriodic acid in the liquid in the presence of potassium hydroxide or carbonate.
Thus iodine is thrown into a solution of pure potash, and hydrogen sulphide passed
through the mixture, the iodine being thus converted into hydriodic acid. Or a solution
is prepared from phosphorus, iodine, and water, containing hydriodic and phosphoric acid;
lime is then added to this solution, when calcium iodide is obtained in solution, and
calcium phosphate as a precipitate. The solution of calcium iodide gives, with potassium
carbonate, insoluble calcium carbonate and a solution of potassium iodide. If iodine is
added to a slightly-heated solution of caustic potash (free from carbonate&mdash;that is, freshly
prepared), so long as the solution is not coloured from the presence of an excess of
iodine, there is formed (as in the action of chlorine on a solution of caustic potash) a
mixture of potassium iodide and iodate. On evaporating the solution thus obtained and
igniting the residue, the iodate is destroyed and converted into iodide, the oxygen being
disengaged, and potassium iodide only is left behind. On dissolving the residue in water
and then evaporating, cubical crystals of the anhydrous salt are obtained, which are
soluble in water and alcohol, and on fusion give an alkaline reaction, owing to the fact that
when ignited a portion of the salt decomposes, forming potassium oxide. The neutral
salt may be obtained by adding hydriodic acid to this alkaline salt until it gives an
acid reaction. It is best to add some finely-divided charcoal to the mixture of iodate
and iodide before igniting it, as this facilitates the evolution of the oxygen from the iodate.
The iodate may also be converted into iodide by the action of certain reducing agents,
such as zinc amalgam, which when boiled with a solution containing an iodate converts
it into iodide. Potassium iodide may also be prepared by mixing a solution of ferrous
iodide (it is best if the solution contain an excess of iodine) and potassium carbonate, in
which case ferrous carbonate FeCO<sub>3</sub>, is precipitated (with an excess of iodine the precipitate
is granular, and contains a compound of the suboxide and oxide of iron), while
potassium iodide remains in solution. Ferrous iodide, FeI<sub>2</sub>, is obtained by the direct
action of iodine on iron in water. Potassium iodide considerably lowers the temperature
(by 24°), when it dissolves in water, 100 parts of the salt dissolve in 73·5 parts of water at
12·5°, in 70 parts at 18°, whilst the saturated solution which boils at 120° contains 100
parts of salt per 45 parts of water. Solutions of potassium iodide dissolve a considerable
amount of iodine; strong solutions even dissolving as much or more iodine than they
contain as potassium iodide (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_3_BIS_779">3 bis</a> and Chapter XI., Note <a href="#Footnote_64_690">64</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_788" id="Footnote_11_788"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_788"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Caustic potash is not only formed by the action of lime on dilute solutions of
potassium carbonate (as sodium hydroxide is prepared from sodium carbonate), but
by igniting potassium nitrate with finely-divided copper (<i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_15_794">15</a>), and also by mixing
solutions of potassium sulphate (or even of alum, KAlS<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) and barium hydroxide,
BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. It is sometimes purified by dissolving it in alcohol (the impurities, for example,
potassium sulphate and carbonate, are not dissolved) and then evaporating the alcohol.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of potassium hydroxide is 2·04, but that of its solutions (see
Chapter XII., Note <a href="#Footnote_18_738">18</a>) at 15° S = 9,992 + 90·4<i>p</i> + 0·28<i>p</i><sup>2</sup> (here <i>p</i><sup>2</sup> is +, and for sodium
hydroxide it is -). Strong solutions, when cooled, yield a crystallo-hydrate, KHO,4H<sub>2</sub>O,
which dissolves in water, producing cold (like 2NaHO,7H<sub>2</sub>O), whilst potassium hydroxide
in solution develops a considerable amount of heat.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_789" id="Footnote_12_789"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_789"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> When the yellow prussiate is heated to redness, all the cyanogen which was in
combination with the iron is decomposed into nitrogen, which is evolved as gas, and
carbon, which combines with the iron. In order to avoid this, potassium carbonate is
added to the yellow prussiate while it is being fused. A mixture of 8 parts of anhydrous
yellow prussiate and 3 parts of pure potassium carbonate is generally taken. Double
decomposition then takes place, resulting in the formation of ferrous carbonate and
potassium cyanide. But by this method, as by the first, a pure salt is not obtained,
because a portion of the potassium cyanide is oxidised at the expense of the iron
carbonate and forms potassium cyanate, FeCO<sub>3</sub> + KCN = CO<sub>2</sub> + Fe + KCNO; and the
potassium cyanide very easily forms oxide, which acts on the sides of the vessel in
which the mixture is heated (to avoid this iron vessels should be used). By adding
one part of charcoal powder to the mixture of 8 parts of anhydrous yellow prussiate and
3 parts of potassium carbonate a mass is obtained which is free from cyanate, because
the carbon absorbs the oxygen, but in that case it is impossible to obtain a colourless
potassium cyanide by simple fusion, although this may be easily done by dissolving it in
alcohol. Cyanide of potassium may also be obtained from potassium thiocyanate, which
is formed from ammonium thiocyanate obtained by the action of ammonia upon bisulphide
of carbon (<i>see</i> works upon Organic Chemistry). Potassium cyanide is now prepared in
large quantities from yellow prussiate for gilding and silvering. When fused in large
quantities the action of the oxygen of the air is limited, and with great care the operation
may be successfully conducted, and therefore, on a large scale, very pure salt is sometimes
obtained. When slowly cooled, the fused salt separates in cubical crystals like
potassium chloride.</p>

<p>Pure KCN is obtained by passing CNH gas into an alcoholic solution of KHO. The
large amount of potassium cyanide which is now required for the extraction of gold
from its ores, is being replaced by a mixture (Rossler and Gasslaker, 1892) of KCN and
NaCN, prepared by heating powdered and dried yellow prussiate with metallic sodium:
K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub> + 2Na = 4KCN + 2NaCN + Fe. This method offers two advantages over the
above methods: (1) the whole of the cyanide is obtained, and does not decompose with
the formation of N<sub>2</sub>; and (2) no cyanates are formed, as is the case when carbonate of
potash is heated with the prussiate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_790" id="Footnote_13_790"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_790"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> A considerable quantity of potassium cyanide is used in the arts, more particularly
for the preparation of metallic solutions which are decomposed by the action of a galvanic
current; thus it is very frequently employed in electro-silvering and gilding. An
alkaline solution is prepared, which is moderately stable owing to the fact that potassium
cyanide in the form of certain double salts&mdash;that is, combined with other cyanides&mdash;is
far more stable than when alone (yellow prussiate, which contains potassium cyanide in
combination with ferrous cyanide, is an example of this).</p></div>

to a radiated crystalline mass; but it does not exhibit this structure if metallic
chlorides be present, so that this method may be taken advantage of to determine the

<p>The maximum solubility proved not to correspond with the most fusible mixture, but
to one much richer in sodium nitrate.</p>

<p>Both these phenomena show that in homogeneous liquid mixtures the chemical forces
that act between substances are the same as those that determine the molecular weights
of substances, even when the mixture consists of such analogous substances as potassium
and sodium nitrates, between which there is no direct chemical interchange. It is
instructive to note also that the maximum solubility does not correspond with the minimum
fusing point, which naturally depends on the fact that in solution a third substance,
namely water, plays a part, although an attraction between the salts, like that which
exists between sodium and potassium carbonates (Note <a href="#Footnote_8_784">8</a>), also partially acts.</p></div>

certain metals&mdash;for example, of finely-divided copper&mdash;aids the last decomposition. The
oxygen in this case naturally passes over to the metal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_795" id="Footnote_16_795"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_795"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> In China, where the manufacture of gunpowder has long been carried on, 75·7 parts
of nitre, 14·4 of charcoal, and 9·9 of sulphur are used. Ordinary powder for sporting
purposes contains 80 parts of nitre, 12 of charcoal, and 8 of sulphur, whilst the gunpowder
used in heavy ordnance contains 75 of nitre, 15 of charcoal, and 10 of sulphur. Gunpowder
explodes when heated to 300°, when struck, or by contact with a spark. A
compact or finely-divided mass of gunpowder burns slowly and has but little disruptive
action, because it burns gradually. To act properly the gunpowder must have a definite
rate of combustion, so that the pressure should increase during the passage of the
projectile along the barrel of the fire-arm. This is done by making the powder in large
granules or in the shape of six-sided prisms with holes through them (prismatic
powder).</p>

<p>The products of combustion are of two kinds: (1) gases which produce the pressure
and are the cause of the dynamical action of gunpowder, and (2) a solid residue,
usually of a black colour owing to its containing unburnt particles of charcoal. Besides
charcoal, the residue generally contains potassium sulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S, and a whole series of
other salts&mdash;for instance, carbonate and sulphate. It is apparent from this that the
combustion of gunpowder is not so simple as it appears to be from the above formula, and
hence the weight of the residue is also greater than indicated by that formula. According
to the formula, 270 parts of gunpowder give 110 parts of residue&mdash;that is, 100 parts of
powder give 37·4 parts of residue, K<sub>2</sub>S, whilst in reality the weight of the residue varies
from 40 p.c. to 70 p.c. (generally 52 p.c.). This difference depends on the fact that so
much oxygen (of the nitre) remains in the residue, and it is evident that if the residue
varies the composition of the gases evolved by the powder will vary also, and therefore
the entire process will be different in different cases. The difference in the composition
of the gases and residue depends, as the researches of Gay-Lussac, Shishkoff and Bunsen,
Nobel and Abel, Federoff, Debus, &amp;c., show, on the conditions under which the
combustion of the powder proceeds. When gunpowder burns in an open space, the
gaseous products which are formed do not remain in contact with the residue, and then
a considerable portion of the charcoal entering into the composition of the powder
remains unburnt, because the charcoal burns after the sulphur at the expense of the
oxygen of the nitre. In this extreme case the commencement of the combustion of the
gunpowder may be expressed by the equation, 2KNO<sub>3</sub> + 3C + S = 2C + K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + N<sub>2</sub>.
The residue in a blank cartridge often consists of a mixture of C, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, and
K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. If the combustion of the gunpowder be impeded&mdash;if it take place in a cartridge
in the barrel of a gun&mdash;the quantity of potassium sulphate will first be diminished, then
the amount of sulphite, whilst the amount of carbonic anhydride in the gases and the
amount of potassium sulphide in the residue will increase. The quantity of charcoal
entering into the action will then be also increased, and hence the amount in the residue
will decrease. Under these circumstances the weight of the residue will be less&mdash;for
example, 4K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 4S = K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + 3K<sub>2</sub>S + 4CO<sub>2</sub>. Besides which, carbonic oxide has been
found in the gases, and potassium bisulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>, in the residue of gunpowder. The
amount of potassium sulphide, K<sub>2</sub>S, increases with the completeness of the combustion,
and is formed in the residue at the expense of the potassium sulphite. In recent times
the knowledge of the action of gunpowder and other explosives has made much progress,
and has developed into a vast province of artillery science, which, guided by the
discoveries of chemistry, has worked out a &lsquo;smokeless powder&rsquo; which burns without
leaving a residue, and does not therefore give any &lsquo;powder smoke&rsquo; (to hinder the rapidity
of firing and aiming), and at the same time disengages a greater volume of gas and consequently
gives (under proper conditions of combustion) the possibility of communicating
to the charge a greater initial velocity, and therefore greater distance, force,
and accuracy of aim. Such &lsquo;smokeless powder&rsquo; is prepared either from the varieties of
nitrocellulose (Chapter VI., Note <a href="#Footnote_37_368">37</a>) or from a mixture of them with nitro-glycerine
(<i>ibid</i>). In burning they give, besides steam and nitrogen, generally a large amount of
oxide of carbon (this is a very serious drawback in all the present forms of smokeless
powder, because carbonic oxide is poisonous), and also CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, &amp;c.</p></div>

are required which give a greater dispersion, and are furnished for this

through the upper portion of the same six prisms, and again by an internal total reflection
passes into the ocular tube. With such a powerful dispersion the relative position
of the spectral lines may be determined with accuracy. For the absolute and exact
determination of the wave lengths it is particularly important that the spectroscope
should be furnished with diffraction gratings. The construction of spectroscopes destined
for special purposes (for example, for investigating the light of stars, or for determining
the absorption spectra in microscopic preparations, &amp;c.) is exceedingly varied.

dispersion and diffraction, and the theory of light, which allows of the determination
of the length of the waves of light in absolute measure on the basis of observations

<p>In the following table are given the <i>wave-lengths</i> of the light rays (the longest and
most distinct, <i>see</i> later) for certain elements, those in black type being the most clearly
defined and distinct lines, which are easily obtained either in the flame of a Bunsen's

to the elements (the lines of compounds are different, as will be afterwards explained,
but many compounds are decomposed by the flame or by an electric discharge), and
moreover to the elements in an incandescent and rarefied gaseous state, for the
spectra sometimes vary considerably with a variation of temperature and pressure.</p>

<p>It may be mentioned that the <i>red</i> colour corresponds with lines having a wave-length
of from 780 (with a greater wave-length the lines are hardly visible, and are ultra red) to
650, the <i>orange</i> from 650 to 590, the <i>yellow</i> from 590 to 520, the <i>green</i> from 520 to 490,
the <i>blue</i> from 490 to 420, and the <i>violet</i> from 420 to 380 millionth parts of a millimetre.
Beyond 380 the lines are scarcely visible, and belong to the ultra-violet. For fluorine
Moissan found as many as 13 bright lines from 744 to 623.</p>

<p>In the table (p. <a href="#Page_565">565</a>) which is arranged in conformity with the image of the spectrum as
it is seen (the red lines on the left-hand and the violet on the right-hand side), the figures
in black type correspond with lines which are so bright and distinctly visible that they may
easily be made use of, both in determining the relation between the divisions of the scale
and the wave-lengths, and in determining the admixture of a given element with another.
Brackets join those lines between which several other lines are clearly visible if the
dispersive power of the spectroscope permits distinguishing the neighbouring lines. In
the ordinary laboratory spectroscopes
with one prism, even with all possible
precision of arrangement and with a
brilliancy of light permitting the
observations being made with a very
narrow aperture, the lines whose wave-lengths
only differ by 2&ndash;3 millionths
of a millimetre, are blurred together;
and with a wide aperture a series of
lines differing by even as much as
20 millionths of a millimetre appear
as one wide line. With a faint light
(that is, with a small quantity of
light entering into the spectroscope)
only the most <i>brilliant</i> lines are
clearly visible. The <i>length</i> of the
lines does not always correspond
with their brilliancy. According to
Lockyer this length is determined
by placing the carbon electrodes
(between which the incandescent
vapours of the metals are formed),
not horizontally to the slit (as they
are generally placed, to give more
light), but vertically to it. Then
certain lines appear long and others
short. As a rule (Lockyer, Dewar,
Cornu), the longest lines are those
with which it is easiest to obtain
<i>reversed</i> spectra (<i>see</i> later). Consequently,
these lines are the most
characteristic. Only the longest and
most brilliant are given in our table,
which is composed on the basis of
a collection of the data at our disposal
for <i>bright</i> spectra of the <i>incandescent
and rarefied vapours of
the elements</i>. As the spectra change
with great variations of temperature
and vapour density (the faint lines
become brilliant whilst the bright
lines sometimes disappear), which is
particularly clear from Ciamician's
researches on the halogens, until
the method of observation and the
theory of the subject are enlarged,
particular theoretical importance
should not be given to the wave-lengths
showing the maximum brilliancy,
which only possess a practical
significance in the common methods
of spectroscopic observations. In
general the spectra of metals are simpler than those of the halogens, and the latter are

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_808" id="Footnote_28_808"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_808"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> The method of observing absorption spectra consists in taking a continuous
spectrum of white light (one which does not show either dark lines or particularly
bright luminous bands&mdash;for instance, the light of a candle, lamp, or other source). The
collimator (that is, the tube with the slit) is directed towards this light, and then all the
colours of the spectrum are visible in the ocular tube. A transparent absorptive
medium&mdash;for instance, a solution or tube containing a gas&mdash;is then placed between the
source of light and the apparatus (or anywhere inside the apparatus itself in the path of
the rays). In this case either the entire spectrum is uniformly fainter, or absorption
bands appear on the bright field of the continuous spectrum in definite positions along
it. These bands have different lengths and positions, and distinctness and intensity of
absorption, according to the properties of the absorptive medium. Like the luminous
spectra given by incandescent gases and vapours, the absorption spectra of a number of
substances have already been studied, and some with great precision&mdash;as, for example,
the spectrum of the brown vapours of nitrogen dioxide by Hasselberg (at Pulkowa),
the spectra of colouring matters (Eder and others), especially of those applied to orthochromatic
photography, the spectra of blood, chlorophyll (the green constituent of leaves),
and other similar substances, all the more carefully as by the aid of their spectra the
presence of these substances may be discovered in small quantities (even in microscopical
quantities, by the aid of special appliances on the microscope), and the changes they
undergo investigated.</p>

<p>The absorption spectra, obtained at the ordinary temperature and proper to
substances in all physical states, offer a most extensive but as yet little studied field, both
for the general theory of spectroscopy, and for gaining an insight into the structure of
substances. The investigation of colouring matters has already shown that in certain
cases a definite change of composition and structure entails not only a definite
change of the colours but also a displacement of the absorption bands by a definite
number of wave-lengths.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_809" id="Footnote_29_809"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_809"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> A number of methods have been invented to demonstrate the reversibility of
spectra; among these methods we will cite two which are very easily carried out. In
Bunsen's method sodium chloride is put into an apparatus for evolving hydrogen (the
spray of the salt is then carried off by the hydrogen and colours the flame with the
yellow sodium colour), and the hydrogen is ignited in two burners&mdash;in one large one
with a wide flame giving a bright yellow sodium light, and in another with a small fine
orifice whose flame is pale: this flame will throw a dark patch on the large bright flame.
In Ladoffsky's method the front tube (p. <a href="#Page_561">561</a>) is unscrewed from a spectroscope directed
towards the light of a lamp (a continuous spectrum), and the flame of a spirit lamp
coloured by a small quantity of NaCl is placed between the tube and the prism; a black
band corresponding to sodium will then be seen on looking through the ocular tube.
This experiment is always successful if only there be the requisite relation between the
strength of light of the two lamps.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_810" id="Footnote_30_810"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_810"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> The absorptive capacity is the relation between the intensity of the light (of a
given wave-length) falling upon and retained by a substance. Bunsen and Roscoe
showed by direct experiment that this ratio is a constant quantity for every substance.
If <i>A</i> stand for this ratio for a given substance at a given temperature&mdash;for instance, for
a flame coloured by sodium&mdash;and <i>E</i> be the intensity of the light of the same wave-length
emitted at the same temperature by the same substance, then Kirchhoff's law, the explanation
and deduction of which must be looked for in text-books of physics, states that
the fraction <i>A/E</i> is a constant quantity depending on the nature of a substance (as <i>A</i>
depends on it) and determined by the temperature and wave-length.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_31_811" id="Footnote_31_811"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_811"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Heated metals begin to emit light (only visible in the dark) at about 420° (varying
with the metal). On further heating, solids first emit red, then yellow, and lastly
white light. Compressed or heavy gases (<i>see</i> Chapter III., Note <a href="#Footnote_44_220">44</a>), when strongly heated,
also emit white light. Heated liquids (for example, molten steel or platinum) also give
a white compound light. This is readily understood. In a dense mass of matter the
collisions of the molecules and atoms are so frequent that waves of only a few definite
lengths cannot appear; the reverse is possible in rarefied gases or vapours.</p></div>

Fraunhofer lines from the solar lines. Janssen showed that the spectrum of the atmosphere
contains lines which depend on the absorption produced by aqueous vapour.
Egoreff, Olszewski, Janssen, and Liveing and Dewar showed by a series of experiments
that the oxygen of the atmosphere gives rise to certain lines of the solar spectrum,
especially the line A. Liveing and Dewar took a layer of 165 c.m. of oxygen compressed
under a pressure of 85 atmospheres, and determined its absorption spectrum, and found
that, besides the Fraunhofer lines A and B, it contained the following groups: 630&ndash;622,
581&ndash;568, 535, 480&ndash;475. The same lines were found for liquid oxygen.</p></div>

spectra of the stars would be the same as the solar spectrum; but Huyghens, Lockyer,
and others showed not only that this is the case for only a few stars, but that the

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_814" id="Footnote_33_814"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_814"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> Eruptions, like our volcanic eruptions, but on an incomparably larger scale, are of
frequent occurrence on the sun. They are seen as protuberances visible during a total
eclipse of the sun, in the form of vaporous masses on the edge of the solar disc and
emitting a faint light. These protuberances of the sun are now observed at all times by
means of the spectroscope (Lockyer's method), because they contain luminous vapours
(giving bright lines) of hydrogen and other elements.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_34_815" id="Footnote_34_815"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_815"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> The great interest and vastness of astro-physical observations concerning the sun,
comets, stars, nebulæ, &amp;c., render this new province of natural science very important,
and necessitate referring the reader to special works on the subject.</p>

<p>The most important astro-physical data since the time of Kellner are those referring
to the <i>displacement</i> of the lines of the spectrum. Just as a musical note changes its
pitch with the approach or withdrawal of the resonant object or the ear, so the pitch of
the luminous note or wave-length of the light varies if the luminous (or absorbent) vapour
and the earth from which we observe it approach or recede from each other; this
expresses itself in a visible displacement of the spectral lines. The solar eruptions even
give broken lines in the spectrum, because the rapidly moving eruptive masses of vapour
and gases either travel in the direction of the eye or fall back towards the sun. As the
earth travels with the solar system among the stars, so it is possible to determine the
direction and velocity with which the sun travels in space by the displacement of the
spectral lines and light of the stars. The changes proceeding on the sun in its mass,
which must be pronounced as vaporous, and in its atmosphere, are now studied by
means of the spectroscope. For this purpose, many special astro-physical observatories
now exist where these investigations are carried on.</p>

<p>We may remark that if the observer or luminous object moves with a velocity
±<i>v</i>, the ray, whose wave-length is &#955;, has an apparent wave-length &#955;

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup"><i>n</i>±<i>v</i></span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn"><i>n</i></span>
</span>,

where <i>n</i> is the
velocity of light. Thus Tolon, Huyghens, and others proved that the star Aldebaran
approaches the solar system with a velocity of 30 kilometres per second, while Arcturus
is receding with a velocity of 45 kilometres. The majority of stars give a distinct
hydrogen spectrum, besides which nebulæ also give the spectrum of nitrogen. Lockyer
classes the stars from their spectra, according to their period of formation, showing that
some stars are in a period of increasing temperature (of formation or aggregation),
whilst others are in a period of cooling. Altogether, in the astro-physical investigation
of the spectra of heavenly bodies we find one of the most interesting subjects of recent
science.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_35_816" id="Footnote_35_816"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_816"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> Spectrum analysis has proved the indubitable existence in the sun and stars of a
number of elements known in chemistry. Huyghens, Secchi, Lockyer, and others have
furnished a large amount of material upon this subject. A compilation of existing
information on it has been given by Prof. S. A. Kleiber, in the Journal of the
Russian Physico-chemical Society for 1885 (vol. xviii. p. 146). Besides which, a peculiar
element called helium has been discovered, which is characterised by a line (whose wave-length
is 587·5, situated near D), which is seen very brightly in the projections (protuberances)
and spots of the sun, but which does not belong to any known element, and
is not reproducible as a reversed, dark line. This may be a right conclusion&mdash;that is to
say, it is possible that an element may be discovered to which the spectrum of helium
corresponds&mdash;but it may be that the helium line belongs to one of the known elements,
because spectra vary in the brilliancy and position of their lines with changes of
temperature and pressure. Thus, for instance, Lockyer could only see the line 423, at
the very end of the calcium spectrum, at comparatively low temperatures, whilst the
lines 397 and 393 appear at a higher temperature, and at a still higher temperature the
line 423 becomes quite invisible.</p></div>

of substances
in solution.</p></div>

<p>Spectroscopic observations are still further complicated by the fact that one and
the same substance gives different spectra at different temperatures. This is especially
the case with gases whose spectra are obtained by an electric discharge in tubes.
Plücker, Wüllner, Schuster, and others showed that at low temperatures and pressures
the spectra of iodine, sulphur, nitrogen, oxygen, &amp;c. are quite different from the
spectra of the same elements at high temperatures and pressures. This may either
depend on the fact that the elements change their molecular structure with a change of
temperature, just as ozone is converted into oxygen (for instance, from N<sub>2</sub> molecules are
obtained containing only one atom of nitrogen), or else it may be because at low temperature
certain rays have a greater relative intensity than those which appear at higher temperatures.
If we suppose that the molecules of a gas are in continual motion, with a
velocity dependent on the temperature, then it must be admitted that they often strike
against each other and rebound, and thus communicate peculiar motions to each other
and the supposed ether, which express themselves in luminiferous phenomena. A rise
of the temperature or an increase in the density of a gas must have an influence on the
collision of its molecules and luminiferous motions thus produced,
and this may be the cause of the difference of the spectra under
these circumstances. It has been shown by direct experiment
that gases compressed by pressure, when the collision of the
molecules must be frequent and varied, exhibit a more complex
spectrum on the passage of an electric spark than rarefied gases,
and that even a continuous spectrum appears. In order to show
the variability of the spectrum according to the circumstances
under which it proceeds, it may be mentioned that potassium
sulphate fused on a platinum wire gives, on the passage of a series
of sparks, a distinct system of lines, 583&ndash;578, whilst when a series
of sparks is passed through a solution of this salt this system of
lines is faint, and when Roscoe and Schuster observed the absorption
spectrum of the vapour of metallic potassium (which is green)
they remarked a number of lines of the same intensity as the above
system in the red, orange, and yellow portions.</p>

<p>The spectra of solutions are best observed by means of Lecoq
de Boisbaudran's arrangement, shown in fig. <a href="#fig_76">76</a>. A bent capillary
tube, D F, inside which a platinum wire, A <i>a</i> (from 0·3 to 0·5 mm.
in diameter) is fused, is immersed in a narrow cylinder, C (in
which it is firmly held by a cork). The projecting end, <i>a</i>, of
the wire is covered by a fine capillary tube, <i>d</i>, which extends
1&ndash;2 mm. beyond the wire. Another straight capillary tube, E,
with a platinum wire, B <i>b</i>, about 1 mm. in diameter (a finer wire soon becomes hot),
is held (by a cork or in a stand) above the end of the tube, D. If the wire A be
now connected with the positive, and the wire B with the negative terminal of a
Ruhmkorff's coil (if the wires be connected in the opposite order, the spectrum of air is
obtained), a series of sparks rapidly following each other appear between <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, and
their light may be examined by placing the apparatus in front of the slit of a spectroscope.
The variations to which a spectrum is liable may easily be observed by increasing
the distance between the wires, altering the direction of the current or strength of the
solution, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_818" id="Footnote_37_818"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_818"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> The importance of the spectroscope for the purpose of chemical research was
already shown by Gladstone in 1856, but it did not become an accessory to the laboratory
until after the discoveries of Kirchhoff and Bunsen. It may be hoped that in time
spectroscopic researches will meet certain wants of the theoretical (philosophical)
side of chemistry, but as yet all that has been done in this respect can only be regarded
as attempts which have not yet led to any trustworthy conclusions. Thus many investigators,
by collating the wave-lengths of all the light vibrations excited by a given element,
endeavour to find the law governing their mutual relations; others (especially Hartley
and Ciamician), by comparing the spectra of analogous elements (for instance, chlorine,
bromine, and iodine), have succeeded in noticing definite features of resemblance in
them, whilst others (Grünwald) search for relations between the spectra of compounds
and their component elements, &amp;c.; but&mdash;owing to the multiplicity of the spectral lines
proper to many elements, and (especially in the ultra-red and ultra-violet ends of the
spectrum) the existence of lines which are undistinguishable owing to their faintness,
and also owing to the comparative novelty of spectroscopic research&mdash;this subject cannot
be considered as in any way perfected. Nevertheless, in certain instances there is
evidently some relationship between the wave-lengths of all the spectral lines formed by
a given element. Thus, in the hydrogen spectrum the wave-length = 364·542 <i>m</i><sup>2</sup>/(<i>m</i><sup>2</sup> - 4),
if <i>m</i> varies as a series of whole numbers from 3 to 15 (Walmer, Hagebach, and others).
For example, when <i>m</i> = 3, the wave-length of one of the brightest lines of the hydrogen
spectrum is obtained (656·2), when <i>m</i> = 7, one of the visible violet lines (396·8), and when
<i>m</i> is greater than 9, the ultra-violet lines of the hydrogen spectrum.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_819" id="Footnote_38_819"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_819"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> In order to show the degree of sensitiveness of spectroscopic reactions the
following observation of Dr. Bence Jones may be cited: If a solution of 3 grains of
a lithium salt be injected under the skin of a guinea-pig, after the lapse of four
minutes, lithium can be discovered in the bile and liquids of the eye, and, after ten
minutes, in all parts of the animal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_820" id="Footnote_39_820"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_820"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Thus <i>spodumene</i> contains up to 6 p.c. of lithium oxide, and <i>petolite</i>, and <i>lepidolite</i>
or lithia mica, about 3 p.c. of lithium oxide. This mica is met with in certain granites
in a somewhat considerable quantity, and is therefore most frequently employed for the
preparation of lithium compounds. The treatment of lepidolite is carried on on a large
scale, because certain salts of lithium are employed in medicine as a remedy for certain
diseases (stone, gouty affections), as they have the power of dissolving the insoluble
uric acid which is then deposited. Lepidolite, which is unacted on by acids in its
natural state, decomposes under the action of strong hydrochloric acid after it has been
fused. After being subjected to the action of the hydrochloric acid for several hours all
the silica is obtained in an insoluble form, whilst the metallic oxides pass into solution
as chlorides. This solution is mixed with nitric acid to convert the ferrous salts into
ferric, and sodium carbonate is then added until the liquid becomes neutral, by which
means a precipitate is formed of the oxides of iron, alumina, magnesia, &amp;c., as insoluble
oxides and carbonates. The solution (with an excess of water) then contains the chlorides
of the alkaline metals KCl, NaCl, LiCl, which do not give a precipitate with
sodium carbonate in a dilute solution. It is then evaporated, and a strong solution of
sodium carbonate added. This precipitates lithium carbonate, which, although soluble
in water, is much less so than sodium carbonate, and therefore the latter precipitates
lithium from strong solutions as carbonate, 2LiCl + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = 2NaCl + Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. <i>Lithium
carbonate</i>, which resembles sodium carbonate in many respects, is a substance which is
very slightly soluble in cold water and is only moderately soluble in boiling water. In
this respect lithium forms a transition between the metals of the alkalis and other
metals, especially those of the alkaline earths (magnesium, barium), whose carbonates
are only sparingly soluble. Oxide of lithium, Li<sub>2</sub>O, may be obtained by heating
lithium carbonate with charcoal. Lithium oxide in dissolving gives (per gram-molecule)
26,000 heat units; but the combination of Li<sub>2</sub> with O evolves 140,000 calories&mdash;that is,
more than Na<sub>2</sub>O (100,000 calories) and K<sub>2</sub>O (97,000 calories), as shown by Beketoff (1887).
Oeuvrard (1892) heated lithium to redness in nitrogen, and observed the absorption of
N and formation of Li<sub>3</sub>N, like Na<sub>3</sub>N (<i>see</i> Chapter XII. Note 50).</p>

<p>LiCl, LiBr, and LiI form crystallo-hydrates with H<sub>2</sub>O, 2H<sub>2</sub>O, and 3H<sub>2</sub>O. As a rule,
LiBr,2H<sub>2</sub>O crystallises out, but Bogorodsky (1894) showed that a solution containing
LiBr + 3·7H<sub>2</sub>O, cooled to -62°, separates out crystals LiBr,3H<sub>2</sub>O, which decompose at +4°
with the separation of H<sub>2</sub>O. LiF is but slightly soluble (in 800 parts) in water (and still
less so in a solution of NH<sub>4</sub>F).</p></div>

method, and to act with a current of 10 ampères at 20 volts, and not to heat above 450°,
so as to avoid the formation of Li<sub>2</sub>Cl.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_822" id="Footnote_40_822"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_822"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> In determining the presence of lithium in a given compound, it is best to treat the
material under investigation with acid (in the case of mineral silicon compounds hydrofluoric
acid must be taken), and to treat the residue with sulphuric acid, evaporate to
dryness, and extract with alcohol, which dissolves a certain amount of the lithium
sulphate. It is easy to discover lithium in such an alcoholic solution by means of the
coloration imparted to the flame on burning it, and in case of doubt by investigating its
light in a spectroscope, because lithium gives a red line, which is very characteristic and
is found as a dark line in the solar spectrum. Lithium was first discovered in 1817 in
petolite by Arfvedson.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_823" id="Footnote_41_823"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_823"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> The salts of the majority of metals are precipitated as carbonates on the addition
of ammonium carbonate&mdash;for instance, the salts of calcium, iron, &amp;c. The alkalis whose
carbonates are soluble are not, however, precipitated in this case. On evaporating the
resultant solution and igniting the residue (to remove the ammonium salts), we obtain
salts of the alkali metals. They may he separated by adding hydrochloric acid together
with a solution of platinic chloride. The chlorides of lithium and sodium give easily soluble
double salts with platinic chloride, whilst the chlorides of potassium, rubidium, and
cæsium form double salts which are sparingly soluble. A hundred parts of water at
0° dissolve 0·74 part of the potassium platinochloride; the corresponding rubidium
platinochloride is only dissolved to the amount of 0·134 part, and the cæsium salt,
0·024 part; at 100° 5·13 parts of potassium platinochloride, K<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>, are dissolved,
0·634 part of rubidium platinochloride, and 0·177 part of cæsium platinochloride.
From this it is clear how the salts of rubidium and cæsium may be isolated. The
separation of cæsium from rubidium by this method is very tedious. It can be better
effected by taking advantage of the difference of the solubility of their carbonates in
alcohol; cæsium carbonate, Cs<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, is soluble in alcohol, whilst the corresponding salts
of rubidium and potassium are almost insoluble. Setterberg separated these metals as
alums, but the best method, that given by Scharples, is founded on the fact that from
a mixture of the chlorides of potassium, sodium, cæsium, and rubidium in the presence
of hydrochloric acid, stannic chloride precipitates a double salt of cæsium, which
is very slightly soluble. The salts of Rb and Cs are closely analogous to those of
potassium.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_824" id="Footnote_42_824"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_824"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> Bunsen obtained rubidium by distilling a mixture of the tartrate with soot, and
Beketoff (1888) by heating the hydroxide with aluminium, 2RbHO + Al = RbAlO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> + Rb.
By the action of 85 grams of rubidium on water, 94,000 heat units are evolved. Setterberg
obtained cæsium (1882) by the electrolysis of a fused mixture of cyanide of cæsium and
of barium. Winkler (1890) showed that metallic magnesium reduces the hydrates and
carbonates of Rb and Cs like the other alkaline metals. N. N. Beketoff obtained them
with aluminium (see following note).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_BIS_825" id="Footnote_42_BIS_825"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_BIS_825"><span class="label">[42 bis]</span></a> Beketoff (1888) showed that metallic aluminium reduces the hydrates of the
alkaline metals at a red heat (they should be perfectly dry) with the formation of
aluminates (Chapter XVII.), RAlO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;for example, 2KHO + Al = KAlO<sub>2</sub> + K + H<sub>2</sub>. It is
evident that in this case only half of the alkaline metal is obtained free. On the other
hand, K. Winkler (1889) showed that magnesium powder is also able to reduce the
alkaline metals from their hydrates and carbonates. N. N. Beketoff and Tscherbacheff
(1894) prepared cæsium upon this principle by heating its aluminate CsAlO<sub>2</sub> with
magnesium powder. In this case aluminate of magnesium is formed, and the whole of
the cæsium is obtained as metal: 2CsAlO<sub>2</sub> + Mg = MgOAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> + 2Cs. A certain excess of
alumina was taken (in order to obtain a less hygroscopic mass of aluminate), and
magnesium powder (in order to decompose the last traces of water); the CsAlO<sub>2</sub> was
prepared by the precipitation of cæsium alums by caustic baryta, and evaporating the
resultant solution. We may add that N. N. Beketoff (1887) prepared oxide of potassium,
K<sub>2</sub>O, by heating the peroxide, KO, in the vapour of potassium (disengaged from its alloy
with silver), and showed that in dissolving in an excess of water it evolves (for the above-given
molecular weight) 67,400 calories (while 2KHO in dissolving in water evolves
24,920 cal.; so that K<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O gives 42,480 cal.), whence (knowing that K<sub>2</sub> + O + H<sub>2</sub>O in
an excess of water evolves 164,500) it follows that K<sub>2</sub> + O evolves 97,100 cal. This quantity
is somewhat less than that (100,260 cal.) which corresponds to sodium, and the energy of
the action of potassium upon water is explained by the fact that K<sub>2</sub>O evolves more heat
than Na<sub>2</sub>O in combining with water (<i>see</i> Chapter II. Note <a href="#Footnote_9_132">9</a>). Just as hydrogen displaces
half the Na from Na<sub>2</sub>O forming NaHO, so also N. N. Beketoff found from experiment
and thermochemical reasonings that hydrogen displaces half the potassium from K<sub>2</sub>O
forming KHO and evolving 7,190 calories. Oxide of lithium, Li<sub>2</sub>O, which is easily
formed by igniting Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> with carbon (when Li<sub>2</sub>O + 2CO is formed), disengages
26,000 cals. with an excess of water, while the reaction Li<sub>2</sub> + O gives 114,000 cals. and
the reaction Li<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O gives only 13,000 cals., and metallic lithium cannot be liberated
from oxide of lithium with hydrogen (nor with carbon). Thus in the series Li, Na, K,
the formation of R<sub>2</sub>O gives most heat with Li and least with K, while the formation of
RCl evolves most heat with K (105,000 cals.) and least of all with Li (93,500 cals.).
Rubidium, in forming Rb<sub>2</sub>O, gives 94,000 cals. (Beketoff). Cæsium, in acting upon an
excess of water, evolves 51,500 cals., and the reaction Cs<sub>2</sub> + O evolves about 100,000 cals.&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
more than K and Rb, and almost as much as Na&mdash;and oxide of cæsium reacts
with hydrogen (according to the equation Cs<sub>2</sub>O + H = CsHO + Cs) more easily than any
of the oxides of the alkali metals, and this reaction takes place at the ordinary temperature
(the hydrogen is absorbed), as Beketoff showed (1893). He also obtained a
mixed oxide, AgCsO, which was easily formed in the presence of silver, and absorbed
hydrogen with the formation of CsHO.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_826" id="Footnote_43_826"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_826"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> We may here observe that the halogens, and especially iodine, may play the part
of metals (hence iodine is more easily replaced by metals than the other halogens, and it
approaches nearer to the metals in its physical properties than the other halogens).
Schützenberger obtained a compound C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O(OCl), which he called chlorine acetate, by
acting on acetic anhydride, (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O)<sub>2</sub>O, with chlorine monoxide, Cl<sub>2</sub>O. With iodine this
compound gives off chlorine and forms iodine acetate, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O(OI), which also is formed
by the action of iodine chloride on sodium acetate, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O(ONa). These compounds are
evidently nothing else than mixed anhydrides of hypochlorous and hypoiodous acids, or
the products of the substitution of hydrogen in RHO by a halogen (<i>see</i> Chapter XI.,
Notes 29 and 78 bis). Such compounds are very unstable, decompose with an explosion
when heated, and are changed by the action of water and of many other reagents, which
is in accordance with the fact that they contain very closely allied elements, as does Cl<sub>2</sub>O
itself, or ICl or KNa. By the action of chlorine monoxide on a mixture of iodine and
acetic anhydride, Schützenberger also obtained the compound I(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, which is
analogous to ICl<sub>3</sub>, because the group C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is, like Cl, a halogen, forming salts with
the metals. Similar properties are found in iodosobenzene (Chapter XI., Note <a href="#Footnote_79_707">79</a>).</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br /><br />
<span style="font-size: 75%;">THE VALENCY AND SPECIFIC HEAT OF THE METALS. MAGNESIUM. CALCIUM, STRONTIUM, BARIUM, AND BERYLLIUM</span></h2>

<p>It is easy by investigating the composition of corresponding compounds,
to establish the <i>equivalent weights</i> of the metals compared with
hydrogen&mdash;that is, the quantity which replaces one part by weight of
hydrogen. If a metal decomposes acids directly, with the evolution of
hydrogen, the equivalent weight of the metal may be determined
by taking a definite weight of it and measuring the volume of hydrogen
evolved by its action on an excess of acid; it is then easy to calculate
the weight of the hydrogen from its volume.<a name="FNanchor_1_827" id="FNanchor_1_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_827" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The same result may be
arrived at by determining the composition of the normal salts of the
metal; for instance, by finding the weight of metal which combines
with 35·5 parts of chlorine or 80 parts of bromine.<a name="FNanchor_2_828" id="FNanchor_2_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_828" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The equivalent of
a metal may be also ascertained by simultaneously (<i>i.e.</i> in one circuit)
decomposing an acid and a fused salt of a given metal by an electric
current and determining the relation between the amounts of hydrogen
and metal separated, because, according to Faraday's law, electrolytes
(conductors of the second order) are always decomposed in equivalent
quantities.<a name="FNanchor_2_BIS_829" id="FNanchor_2_BIS_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_BIS_829" class="fnanchor">[2 bis]</a> The equivalent of a metal may even be found by simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">[582]</a></span>
determining the relation between its weight and that of its salt-giving
oxide, as by this we know the quantity of the metal which
combines with 8 parts by weight of oxygen, and this will be the
equivalent, because 8 parts of oxygen combine with 1 part by weight of
hydrogen. One method is verified by another, and all the processes
for the accurate determination of equivalents require the greatest care
to avoid the absorption of moisture, further oxidation, volatility,
and other accidental influences which affect exact weighings. The
description of the methods necessary for the attainment of exact
results belongs to the province of analytical chemistry.</p>

<p>For univalent metals, like those of the alkalis, the weight of the
equivalent is equal to the weight of the atom. For bivalent metals
the atomic weight is equal to the weight of two equivalents, for <i>n</i>-valent
metals it is equal to the weight of <i>n</i> equivalents. Thus aluminium,
Al = 27, is trivalent, that is, its equivalent = 9; magnesium, Mg = 24,
is bivalent, and its equivalent = 12. Therefore, if potassium or sodium,
or in general a univalent metal, M, give compounds M<sub>2</sub>O, MHO,
MCl, MNO<sub>3</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c., and in general MX, then for bivalent
metals like magnesium or calcium the corresponding compounds
will be MgO, Mg(HO)<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, Mg(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>, &amp;c., or in general
MX<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>By what are we to be guided in ascribing to some metals univalency
and to others bi-, ter-, quadri-, ... <i>n</i>-valency? What obliges
us to make this difference? Why are not all metals given the same
valency&mdash;for instance, why is not magnesium considered as univalent?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">[583]</a></span>
If this be done, taking Mg = 12 (and not 24 as now), not only is
a simplicity of expression of the composition of all the compounds of
magnesium attained, but we also gain the advantage that their composition
will be the same as those of the corresponding compounds of
sodium and potassium. These combinations were so expressed formerly&mdash;why
has this since been changed?</p>

<p>These questions could only be answered after the establishment of
the idea of multiples of the atomic weights as the minimum quantities
of certain elements combining with others to form compounds&mdash;in
a word, since the time of the establishment of Avogadro-Gerhardt's law
(Chapter <a href="#Page_299">VII</a>.). By taking such an element as arsenic, which has
many volatile compounds, it is easy to determine the density of these
compounds, and therefore to establish their molecular weights, and
hence to find the indubitable atomic weight, exactly as for oxygen,
nitrogen, chlorine, carbon, &amp;c. It appears that As = 75, and its compounds
correspond, like the compounds of nitrogen, with the forms
AsX<sub>3</sub>, and AsX<sub>5</sub>; for example, AsH<sub>3</sub>, AsCl<sub>3</sub>, AsF<sub>5</sub>, As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, &amp;c. It is
evident that we are here dealing with a metal (or rather element) of
two valencies, which moreover is never univalent, but tri- or quinqui-valent.
This example alone is sufficient for the recognition of the
existence of polyvalent atoms among the metals. And as antimony
and bismuth are closely analogous to arsenic in all their compounds,
(just as potassium is analogous to rubidium and cæsium); so,
although very few volatile compounds of bismuth are known, it was
necessary to ascribe to them formulæ corresponding with those ascribed
to arsenic.</p>

<p>As we shall see in describing them, there are also many analogous
metals among the bivalent elements, some of which also give volatile
compounds. For example, zinc, which is itself volatile, gives several
volatile compounds (for instance, zinc ethyl, ZnC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>, which boils at
118°, vapour density = 61·3), and in the molecules of all these compounds
there is never less than 65 parts of zinc, which is equivalent to
H<sub>2</sub>, because 65 parts of zinc displace 2 parts by weight of hydrogen; so
that zinc is just such an example of the bivalent metals as oxygen,
whose equivalent = 8 (because H<sub>2</sub> is replaced by O = 16), is a representative
of the bivalent elements, or as arsenic is of the tri- and
quinqui-valent elements. And, as we shall afterwards see, magnesium
is in many respects closely analogous to zinc, which fact obliges us to
regard magnesium as a bivalent metal.</p>

<p>Such metals as mercury and copper, which are able to give not one
but two bases, are of particular importance for distinguishing univalent
and bivalent metals. Thus copper gives the suboxide Cu<sub>2</sub>O and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">[584]</a></span>
oxide CuO&mdash;that is, the compounds CuX corresponding with the suboxide
are analogous (in the quantitative relations, by their composition)
to NaX or AgX, and the compounds of the oxide CuX<sub>2</sub>, to MgX<sub>2</sub>,
ZnX<sub>2</sub>, and in general to the bivalent metals. It is clear that in such
examples we must make a distinction between atomic weights and
equivalents.</p>

<p>In this manner the valency, that is, the number of equivalents
entering into the atom of the metals may in many cases be established
by means of comparatively few volatile metallic compounds, with
the aid of a search into their analogies (concerning which see Chapter
XV.). <i>The law of specific heats</i> discovered by Dulong and Petit has
frequently been applied to the same purpose<a name="FNanchor_3_830" id="FNanchor_3_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_830" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in the history of chemistry,
especially since the development given to this law by the researches of
Regnault, and since Cannizzaro (1860) showed the agreement between
the deductions of this law and the consequences arising from Avogadro-Gerhardt's
law.</p>

<p>Dulong and Petit, having determined the specific heat of a number
of solid elementary substances, observed that as the atomic weights of
the elements increase, their specific heats decrease, and that <i>the product<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">[585]</a></span>
of the specific heat Q into the atomic weight A is an almost constant
quantity</i>. This means that to bring different elements into a known
thermal state an equal amount of work is required if atomic quantities
of the elements are taken; that is, the amounts of heat expended in
heating equal quantities by weight of the elements are far from equal,
but are in inverse proportion to the atomic weights. For thermal
changes the atom is a unit; all atoms, notwithstanding the difference
of weight and nature, are equal. This is the simplest expression of the
fact discovered by Dulong and Petit. The specific heat measures that
quantity of heat which is required to raise the temperature of <i>one unit
of weight</i> of a substance by one degree. If the magnitude of the
specific heat of elements be multiplied by the atomic weight, then we
obtain the atomic heat&mdash;that is, the amount of heat required to raise
the temperature of the atomic weight of an element by one degree. It
is these products which for the majority of the elements prove to be
approximately, if not quite, identical. A complete identity cannot be
expected, because the specific heat of one and the same substance
varies with the temperature, with its passage from one state into
another, and frequently with even a simple mechanical change of
density (for instance by hammering), not to speak of allotropic changes,
&amp;c. We will cite several figures<a name="FNanchor_4_831" id="FNanchor_4_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_831" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> proving the truth of the conclusions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">[586]</a></span>
arrived at by Dulong and Petit with respect to solid elementary
bodies.</p>

<p>It is seen from this that the product of the specific heat of the
element into the atomic weight is an almost constant quantity,
which is nearly 6. Hence it is possible to determine the valency
by the specific heats of the metals. Thus, for instance, the specific
heats of lithium, sodium, and potassium convince us of the fact that
their atomic weights are indeed those which we chose, because by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">[587]</a></span>
multiplying the specific heats found by experiment by the corresponding
atomic weights we obtain the following figures: Li, 6·59, Na, 6·75
and K, 6·47. Of the alkaline earth metals the specific heats have been
determined: of magnesium = 0·245 (Regnault and Kopp), of calcium
= 0·170 (Bunsen), and of barium = 0·05 (Mendeléeff). If the same
composition be ascribed to the compounds of magnesium as to the
corresponding compounds of potassium, then the equivalent of magnesium
will be equal to 12. On multiplying this atomic weight by the
specific heat of magnesium, we obtain a figure 2·94, which is half that
which is given by the other solid elements and therefore the atomic
weight of magnesium must be taken as equal to 24 and not to 12.
Then the atomic heat of magnesium = 24 × 0·245 = 5·9; for calcium,
giving its compounds a composition CaX<sub>2</sub>&mdash;for example CaCl<sub>2</sub>, CaSO<sub>4</sub>,
CaO (Ca = 40)&mdash;we obtain an atomic heat = 40 × 0·17 = 6·8, and for
barium it is equal to 137 × 0·05 = 6·8; that is, they must be counted
as bivalent, or that their atom replaces H<sub>2</sub>, Na<sub>2</sub>, or K<sub>2</sub>. This conclusion
may be confirmed by a method of analogy, as we shall afterwards
see. The application of the principle of specific heats to the determination
of the magnitudes of the atomic weights of those metals, the
magnitude of whose atomic weights could not be determined by
Avogadro-Gerhardt's law, was made about 1860 by the Italian professor
Cannizzaro.</p>

<p>Exactly the same conclusions respecting the bivalence of magnesium
and its analogues are obtained by comparing the specific heats of their
compounds, especially of the halogen compounds as the most simple,
with the specific heats of the corresponding alkali compounds. Thus,
for instance, the specific heats of magnesium and calcium chlorides,
MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CaCl<sub>2</sub>, are 0·194 and 0·164, and of sodium and potassium
chlorides, NaCl and KCl, 0·214 and 0·172, and therefore their molecular
heats (or the products QM, where M is the weight of the molecule) are
18·4 and 18·2, 12·5 and 12·8, and hence the atomic heats (or the
quotient of QM by the number of atoms) are all nearly 6, as with the
elements. Whilst if, instead of the actual atomic weights Mg = 24
and Ca = 40, their equivalents 12 and 20 be taken, then the atomic
heats of the chlorides of magnesium and calcium would be about 4·6,
whilst those of potassium and sodium chlorides are about 6·3.<a name="FNanchor_5_832" id="FNanchor_5_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_832" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">[588]</a></span>
must remark, however, that as the specific heat or the amount of heat
required to raise the temperature of a unit of weight one degree<a name="FNanchor_6_833" id="FNanchor_6_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_833" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">[589]</a></span>
complex quantity&mdash;including not only the increase of the energy of a
substance with its rise in temperature, but also the external work of
expansion<a name="FNanchor_7_834" id="FNanchor_7_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_834" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and the internal work accomplished in the molecules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">[590]</a></span>
causing them to decompose according to the rise of temperature<a name="FNanchor_8_835" id="FNanchor_8_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_835" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&mdash;therefore
it is impossible to expect in the magnitude of the specific heat
the great simplicity of relation to composition which we see, for instance,
in the density of gaseous substances. Hence, although the specific heat
is one of the important means for determining the atomicity of the
elements, still the mainstay for a true judgment of atomicity is only
given by Avogadro-Gerhardt's law, <i>i.e.</i> this other method can only be
accessory or preliminary, and when possible recourse should be had to
the determination of the vapour density.</p>

<p>Among the bivalent metals the first place, with respect to their
distribution in nature, is occupied by <i>magnesium</i> and <i>calcium</i>, just as
sodium and potassium stand first amongst the univalent metals. The
relation which exists between the atomic weights of these four metals
confirms the above comparison. In fact, the combining weight of
magnesium is equal to 24, and of calcium 40; whilst the combining
weights of sodium and potassium are 23 and 39&mdash;that is, the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">[591]</a></span>
are one unit less than the former.<a name="FNanchor_9_836" id="FNanchor_9_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_836" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> They all belong to the number of
<i>light metals</i>, as they have but a small specific gravity, in which respect
they differ from the ordinary, generally known heavy, or ore, metals (for
instance, iron, copper, silver, and lead), which are distinguished by a
much greater specific gravity. There is no doubt that their low specific
gravity has a significance, not only as a simple point of distinction, but
also as a property which determines the fundamental properties of these
metals. Indeed, all the light metals have a series of points of resemblance
with the metals of the alkalis; thus both magnesium and
calcium, like the metals of the alkalis, decompose water (without the
addition of acids), although not so easily as the latter metals. The
process of the decomposition is essentially one and the same; for
example, Ca + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that is, hydrogen is liberated
and a hydroxide of the metal formed. These hydroxides are bases
which neutralise nearly all acids. However, the hydroxides RH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> of
calcium and magnesium are in no respect so energetic as the hydroxides
of the true metals of the alkalis; thus when heated they lose water,
are not so soluble, develop less heat with acids, and form various salts,
which are less stable and more easily decomposed by heat than the
corresponding salts of sodium and potassium. Thus calcium and
magnesium carbonates easily part with carbonic anhydride when
ignited; the nitrates are also very easily decomposed by heat, calcium
and magnesium oxides, CaO and MgO, being left behind. The chlorides
of magnesium and calcium, when heated with water, evolve hydrogen
chloride, forming the corresponding hydroxides, and when ignited the
oxides themselves. All these points are evidence of a weakening of the
alkaline properties.</p>

<p>These metals have been termed <i>the metals of the alkaline earths</i>,
because they, like the alkali metals, form energetic bases. They are
called alkaline <i>earths</i> because they are met with in nature in a state of
combination, forming the insoluble mass of the earth, and because as
oxides, RO, they themselves have an earthy appearance. Not a few
salts of these metals are known which are insoluble in water, whilst
the corresponding salts of the alkali metals are generally soluble&mdash;for
example, the carbonates, phosphates, borates, and other salts of the
alkaline earth metals are nearly insoluble. This enables us to separate
the metals of the alkaline earths from the metals of the alkalis. For
this purpose a solution of ammonium carbonate is added to a mixed
solution of salts of both kinds of metals, when by a double decomposition
the insoluble carbonates of the metals of the alkaline earths are formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">[592]</a></span>
and fall as a precipitate, whilst the metals of the alkalis remain in
solution: RX<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> = RCO<sub>3</sub> + 2NaX.</p>

<p>We may here remark that the oxides of the metals of the alkaline
earths are frequently called by special names: MgO is called magnesia
or bitter earth; CaO, lime; SrO, strontia; and BaO, baryta.</p>

<p>In the primary rocks the oxides of calcium and magnesium are
combined with silica, sometimes in variable quantities, so that in some
cases the lime predominates and in other cases the magnesium. The two
oxides, being analogous to each other, replace each other in equivalent
quantities. The various forms of <i>augite</i>, <i>hornblende</i>, or <i>amphibole</i>, and
of similar minerals, which enter into the composition of nearly all rocks,
contain lime and magnesia and silica. The majority of the primary
rocks also contain alumina, potash, and soda. These rocks, under
the action of water (containing carbonic acid) and air, give up lime
and magnesia to the water, and therefore they are contained in all
kinds of water, and especially in sea-water. The <i>carbonates</i> CaCO<sub>3</sub> and
MgCO<sub>3</sub>, frequently met with in nature, <i>are soluble in an excess of
water saturated with carbonic anhydride</i>,<a name="FNanchor_10_837" id="FNanchor_10_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_837" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and therefore many natural
waters contain these salts, and are able to yield them when evaporated.
However, one kilogram of water saturated with carbonic anhydride
does not dissolve more than three grams of calcium carbonate. By
gradually expelling the carbonic anhydride from such water, an insoluble
precipitate of calcium carbonate separates out. It may confidently
be stated that the formation of the very widely distributed
strata of calcium and magnesium carbonates was of this nature, because
these strata are of a sedimentary character&mdash;that is, such as would
be exhibited by a gradually accumulating deposit on the bottom of
the sea, and, moreover, frequently containing the remains of marine
plants, and animals, shells, &amp;c. It is very probable that the presence
of these organisms in the sea has played the chief part in the precipitation
of the carbonates from the sea water, because the plants
absorb CO<sub>2</sub>, and many of the organisms CaCO<sub>3</sub>, and after death give
deposits of carbonate of lime; for instance, chalk, which is almost
entirely composed of the minute remains of the calcareous shields of
such organisms. These deposits of calcium and magnesium carbonates
are the most important sources of these metals. Lime generally predominates,
because it is present in rocks and running water in greater
quantity than magnesia, and in this case these sedimentary rocks are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">[593]</a></span>
termed <i>limestone</i>. Some common flagstones used for paving, &amp;c., and
chalk may be taken as examples of this kind of formation. Those
limestones in which a considerable portion of the calcium is replaced by
magnesium are termed <i>dolomites</i>. The dolomites are distinguished by
their hardness, and by their not parting with the whole of their carbonic
anhydride so easily as the limestones under the action of acids.
Dolomites<a name="FNanchor_11_838" id="FNanchor_11_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_838" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> sometimes contain an equal number of molecules of calcium
carbonate and magnesium carbonate, and they also sometimes appear
in a crystalline form, which is easily intelligible, because calcium carbonate
itself is exceedingly common in this form in nature, and is then
known as <i>calc spar</i>, whilst natural crystalline magnesium carbonate is
termed <i>magnesite</i>. The formation of the crystalline varieties of the
insoluble carbonates is explained by the possibility of a slow deposition
from solutions containing carbonic acid. Besides which (Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>.)
calcium and magnesium sulphates are obtained from sea water, and
therefore they are met with both as deposits and in springs. It must
be observed that magnesium is held in considerable quantities in
sea water, because the sulphate and chloride of magnesium are very
soluble in water, whilst calcium sulphate is but little soluble, and is
used in the formation of shells; and therefore if the occurrence of considerable
deposits of magnesium sulphate cannot be expected in nature,
still, on the other hand, one would expect (and they do actually occur)
large masses of calcium sulphate or <i>gypsum</i>, CaSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O. Gypsum
sometimes forms strata of immense size, which extend over many
hectometres&mdash;for example, in Russia on the Volga, and in the Donetz
and Baltic provinces.</p>

<p>Lime and magnesia also, but in much smaller quantities (only to
the amount of several fractions of a per cent. and rarely more), enter
into the composition of every fertile soil, and without these bases the
soil is unable to support vegetation. Lime is particularly important
in this respect, and its presence in a larger quantity generally improves
the harvest, although purely calcareous soils are as a rule infertile.
For this reason the soil is fertilised both with lime<a name="FNanchor_12_839" id="FNanchor_12_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_839" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> itself and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">[594]</a></span>
marl&mdash;that is, with clay mixed with a certain quantity of calcium carbonate,
strata of which are found nearly everywhere.</p>

<p>From the soil the lime and magnesia (in a smaller quantity) pass
into the substance of <i>plants</i>, where they occur as salts. Certain of
these salts separate in the interior of plants in a crystalline form&mdash;for
example, calcium oxalate. The lime occurring in plants serves as the
source for the formation of the various calcareous secretions which are
so common in <i>animals</i> of all classes. The bones of the highest animal
orders, the shells of mollusca, the covering of the sea-urchin, and similar
solid secretions of sea animals, contain calcium salts; namely, the shells
mainly calcium carbonate, and the bones mainly calcium phosphate.
Certain limestones are almost entirely formed of such deposits.
Odessa is situated on a limestone of this kind, composed of shells.
Thus magnesium and calcium occur throughout the entire realm of
nature, but calcium predominates.</p>

<p>As lime and magnesia form bases which are in many respects
analogous, they were not distinguished from each other for a long
time. Magnesia was obtained for the first time in the seventeenth
century from Italy, and used as a medicine; and it was only in the
last century that Black, Bergmann, and others distinguished magnesia
from lime.</p>

<p><i>Metallic magnesium</i> (and calcium also) is not obtained by heating
magnesium oxide or the carbonate with charcoal, as the alkali metals
are obtained,<a name="FNanchor_13_840" id="FNanchor_13_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_840" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> but is liberated by the action of a galvanic current
on fused magnesium chloride (best mixed with potassium chloride);
Davy and Bussy obtained metallic magnesium by acting on magnesium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">[595]</a></span>
chloride with the vapours of potassium. At the present time (Deville's
process) magnesium is prepared in rather considerable quantities by a
similar process, only the potassium is replaced by sodium. Anhydrous
magnesium chloride, together with sodium chloride and calcium fluoride,
is fused in a close crucible. The latter substances only serve to facilitate
the formation of a fusible mass before and after the reaction, which
is indispensable in order to prevent the access and action of air. One
part of finely divided sodium to five parts of magnesium chloride is
thrown into the strongly heated molten mass, and after stirring the
reaction proceeds very quickly, and magnesium separates, MgCl<sub>2</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>
= Mg + 2NaCl. In working on a large scale, the powdery metallic
magnesium is then subjected to distillation at a white heat. The distillation
of the magnesium is necessary, because the undistilled metal is
not homogeneous<a name="FNanchor_14_841" id="FNanchor_14_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_841" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and burns unevenly: the metal is prepared for the
purpose of illumination. Magnesium is a white metal, like silver; it
is not soft like the alkali metals, but is, on the contrary, hard like the
majority of the ordinary metals. This follows from the fact that it
melts at a somewhat high temperature&mdash;namely, about 500°&mdash;and boils
at about 1000°. It is malleable and ductile, like the generality of
metals, so that it can be drawn into wires and rolled into ribbon; it is
most frequently used for lighting purposes in the latter form. Unlike
the alkali metals, magnesium does not decompose the atmospheric
moisture at the ordinary temperature, so that it is almost unacted on
by air; it is not even acted on by water at the ordinary temperature,
so that it may be washed to free it from sodium chloride. Magnesium
only decomposes water with the evolution of hydrogen at the boiling
point of water,<a name="FNanchor_15_842" id="FNanchor_15_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_842" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and more rapidly at still higher temperatures. This
is explained by the fact that in decomposing water magnesium forms
an insoluble hydroxide, MgH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which covers the metal and hinders
the further action of the water. Magnesium easily displaces hydrogen
from acids, forming magnesium salts. When ignited it <i>burns</i>, not only
in oxygen but in air (and even in carbonic anhydride), forming a white
powder of magnesium oxide, or magnesia; in burning it emits a white
and exceedingly <i>brilliant light</i>. The strength of this light naturally
depends on the fact that magnesium (24 parts by weight) in burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">[596]</a></span>
evolves about 140 thousand heat units, and that the product of combustion,
MgO, is infusible by heat; so that the vapour of the burning
magnesium contains an ignited powder of non-volatile and infusible
magnesia, and consequently presents all the conditions for the production
of a brilliant light. The light emitted by burning magnesium
contains many rays which act chemically, and are situated in the violet
and ultra-violet parts of the spectrum. For this reason burning
magnesium may be employed for producing photographic images.<a name="FNanchor_16_843" id="FNanchor_16_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_843" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Owing to its great affinity for oxygen, magnesium <i>reduces</i> many
metals (zinc, iron, bismuth, antimony, cadmium, tin, lead, copper, silver,
and others) from solutions of their salts at the ordinary temperature,<a name="FNanchor_17_844" id="FNanchor_17_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_844" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and at a red heat finely divided magnesium takes up the oxygen from
silica, alumina, boric anhydride, &amp;c.; so that silicon and similar
elements may be obtained by directly heating a mixture of powdered
silica and magnesium in an infusible glass tube.<a name="FNanchor_18_845" id="FNanchor_18_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_845" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The affinity of magnesium for the halogens is much more feeble
than for oxygen,<a name="FNanchor_19_846" id="FNanchor_19_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_846" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> as is at once evident from the fact that a solution
of iodine acts feebly on magnesium; still magnesium burns in the
vapours of iodine, bromine, and chlorine. The character of magnesium
is also seen in the fact that all its salts, especially in the presence
of water, are decomposable at a comparatively moderate temperature,
the elements of the acid being evolved, and the magnesium
oxide, which is non-volatile and unchangeable by heat, being left.
This naturally refers to those acids which are themselves volatilised
by heat. Even magnesium sulphate is completely decomposed at
the temperature at which iron melts, oxide of magnesium remaining
behind. This decomposition of magnesium salts by heat proceeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">[597]</a></span>
much more easily than that of calcium salts. For example, magnesium
carbonate is totally decomposed at 170°, magnesium oxide
being left behind. This <i>magnesia</i>, or <i>magnesium oxide</i>, is met with
both in an anhydrous and hydrated state in nature (the anhydrous
magnesia as the mineral <i>periclase</i>, MgO, and the hydrated magnesia
as <i>brucite</i>, MgH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Magnesia is a well-known medicine (calcined
magnesia&mdash;<i>magnesia usta</i>). It is a white, extremely fine, and very
voluminous powder, of specific gravity 3·4; it is infusible by heat, and
only shrinks or shrivels in an oxyhydrogen flame. After long contact
the anhydrous magnesia combines with water, although very slowly,
forming the hydroxide Mg(HO)<sub>2</sub>, which, however, parts with its
water with great ease when heated even below a red heat, and again
yields anhydrous magnesia. This hydroxide is obtained directly as
a gelatinous amorphous substance when a soluble alkali is mixed with
a solution of any magnesium salt, MgCl<sub>2</sub> + 2KHO = Mg(HO)<sub>2</sub> + 2KCl.
This decomposition is complete, and nearly all the magnesium
passes into the precipitate; and this clearly shows the almost perfect
insolubility of magnesia in water. Water dissolves a scarcely perceptible
quantity of magnesium hydroxide&mdash;namely, one part is dissolved
by 55,000 parts of water. Such a solution, however, has
an alkaline reaction, and gives, with a salt of phosphoric acid, a
precipitate of magnesium phosphate, which is still more insoluble.
Magnesia is not only dissolved by acids, forming salts, but it also displaces
certain other bases&mdash;for example, ammonia from ammonium
salts when boiled; and the hydroxide also absorbs carbonic anhydride
from the air. The magnesium salts, like those of calcium, potassium,
and sodium, are colourless if they are formed from colourless
acids. Those which are soluble have a bitter taste, whence magnesia
has been termed <i>bitter-earth</i>. In comparison with the alkalis magnesia
is a feeble base, inasmuch as it forms somewhat unstable salts, easily
gives basic salts, forms acid salts with difficulty, and is able to give
double salts with the salts of the alkalis, which facts are characteristic
of feeble bases, as we shall see in becoming acquainted with the different
metals.</p>

<p>The power of magnesium salts to form double and basic salts is
very frequently shown in reactions, and is specially marked as regards
ammonium salts. If saturated solutions of magnesium and
ammonium sulphates are mixed together, a crystalline double salt
Mg(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O,<a name="FNanchor_20_847" id="FNanchor_20_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_847" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is immediately precipitated. A strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">[598]</a></span>
solution of ordinary ammonium carbonate dissolves magnesium
oxide or carbonate, and precipitates crystals of a double salt,
Mg(NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, from which water extracts the ammonium
carbonate. With an excess of an ammonium salt the double salt passes
into solution,<a name="FNanchor_21_848" id="FNanchor_21_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_848" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> and therefore if a solution contain a magnesium salt
and an excess of an ammonium salt&mdash;for instance, sal-ammoniac&mdash;then
sodium carbonate will no longer precipitate magnesium carbonate.
A mixture of solutions of magnesium and ammonium chlorides, on
evaporation or refrigeration, gives a double salt, Mg(NH<sub>4</sub>)Cl<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O.<a name="FNanchor_22_849" id="FNanchor_22_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_849" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
The salts of potassium, like those of ammonium, are able to enter into
combination with the magnesium salts.<a name="FNanchor_23_850" id="FNanchor_23_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_850" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> For instance, the double
salt, MgKCl<sub>3</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, which is known as <i>carnallite</i>,<a name="FNanchor_24_851" id="FNanchor_24_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_851" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and occurs in the
salt mines of Stassfurt, may be formed by freezing a saturated solution
of potassium chloride with an excess of magnesium chloride. A saturated
solution of magnesium sulphate dissolves potassium sulphate, and
solid magnesium sulphate is soluble in a saturated solution of potassium
sulphate. A double salt, K<sub>2</sub>Mg(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, which closely resembles
the above-mentioned ammonium salt, crystallises from these solutions.<a name="FNanchor_25_852" id="FNanchor_25_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_852" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">[599]</a></span>
The nearest analogues of magnesium are able to give exactly similar
double salts, both in crystalline form (monoclinic system) and composition;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">[600]</a></span>
they, like this salt (<i>see</i> Chapter XV.), are easily able (at 140°)
to part with all their water of crystallisation, and correspond with
the salts of sulphuric acid, whose type may be taken as <i>magnesium
sulphate</i>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_26_853" id="FNanchor_26_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_853" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It occurs at Stassfurt as <i>kieserite</i>, MgSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O,
and generally separates from solutions as a heptahydrated salt,
MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, and from supersaturated solutions as a hexahydrated
salt, MgSO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O; at temperatures below 0° it crystallises out as a
dodecahydrated salt, MgSO<sub>4</sub>,12H<sub>2</sub>O, and a solution of the composition
MgSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O solidifies completely at -5°.<a name="FNanchor_27_854" id="FNanchor_27_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_854" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Thus between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">[601]</a></span>
water and magnesium sulphate there may exist several definite and
more or less stable degrees of equilibrium; the double salt
MgSO<sub>4</sub>K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O may be regarded as one of these equilibrated
systems, the more so since it contains 6H<sub>2</sub>O, whilst MgSO<sub>4</sub> forms its
most stable system with 7H<sub>2</sub>O, and the double salt may be considered
as this crystallo-hydrate in which one molecule of water is replaced
by the molecule K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_28_855" id="FNanchor_28_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_855" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p><i>The power of forming basic salts</i> is a very remarkable peculiarity
of magnesia and other feeble bases, and especially of those corresponding
with polyvalent metals. The very powerful bases corresponding
with univalent metals&mdash;like potassium and sodium&mdash;do not
form basic salts, and, indeed, are more prone to give acid salts, whilst
magnesium easily and frequently forms basic salts, especially with feeble
acids, although there are some oxides&mdash;as, for example, copper and
lead oxides&mdash;which still more frequently give basic salts. If a cold
solution of magnesium sulphate be mixed with a solution of sodium
carbonate there is formed a gelatinous precipitate of a basic salt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">[602]</a></span>
Mg(HO)<sub>2</sub>,4MgCO<sub>3</sub>,9H<sub>2</sub>O; but all the magnesia is not precipitated in
this case, as a portion of it remains in solution as an acid double salt.
If sodium carbonate be added to a boiling solution of magnesium
sulphate a precipitate of a still more basic salt is formed, 4MgSO<sub>4</sub>
+ 4Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> + 4H<sub>2</sub>O = 4Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>,3MgCO<sub>3</sub>,3H<sub>2</sub>O.
This basic salt forms the ordinary drug <i>magnesia</i> (<i>magnesia alba</i>), in
the form of light porous lumps. Other basic salts are formed under
certain modifications of temperature and conditions of decomposition.
But <i>the normal salt</i>, MgCO<sub>3</sub>, which occurs in nature as magnesite
in the form of rhombohedra of specific gravity 3·056, cannot be
obtained by such a method of precipitation. In fact, the formation of
the different basic salts shows the power of water to decompose the
normal salt. It is possible, however, to obtain this salt both in an
anhydrous and hydrated state. A solution of magnesium carbonate in
water containing carbonic acid is taken for this purpose. The reason
for this is easily understood&mdash;carbonic anhydride is one of the products
of the decomposition of magnesium carbonate in the presence of
water. If this solution be left to evaporate spontaneously the normal
salt separates in a hydrated form, but in the evaporation of a heated
solution, through which a stream of carbonic anhydride is passed, the
anhydrous salt is formed as a crystalline mass, which remains unaltered
in the air, like the natural mineral.<a name="FNanchor_29_856" id="FNanchor_29_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_856" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The decomposing influence of
water on the salts of magnesium, which is directly dependent on the
feeble basic properties of magnesia,<a name="FNanchor_30_857" id="FNanchor_30_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_857" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> is most clearly seen in <i>magnesium
chloride</i>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>. This salt is contained<a name="FNanchor_31_858" id="FNanchor_31_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_858" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> in the last mother-liquors of
the evaporation of sea-water. On cooling a sufficiently concentrated
solution, the crystallo-hydrate, MgCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, separates;<a name="FNanchor_32_859" id="FNanchor_32_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_859" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> but if it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">[603]</a></span>
further heated (above 106°) to remove the water, then hydrochloric
acid passes off together with the latter, so that there ultimately remains
magnesia with a small quantity of magnesium chloride.<a name="FNanchor_33_860" id="FNanchor_33_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_860" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> From what
has been said it is evident that anhydrous magnesium chloride cannot
be obtained by simple evaporation. But if sal-ammoniac or sodium
chloride be added to a solution of magnesium chloride, then the evolution
of hydrochloric acid does not take place, and after complete
evaporation the residue is perfectly soluble in water. This renders it
possible to obtain anhydrous magnesium chloride from its aqueous
solution. Indeed the mixture with sal-ammoniac (in excess) may be
dried (the residue consists of an anhydrous double salt, MgCl<sub>2</sub>,2NH<sub>4</sub>Cl)
and then ignited (460°), when the sal-ammoniac is converted into
vapour and a fused mass of anhydrous magnesium chloride remains
behind. The anhydrous chloride evolves a very considerable amount of
heat on the addition of water, which shows the great affinity the salt
has for water.<a name="FNanchor_34_861" id="FNanchor_34_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_861" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Anhydrous magnesium chloride is not only obtained
by the above method, but is also formed by the direct combination of
chlorine and magnesium, and by the action of chlorine on magnesium
oxide, oxygen being evolved; this proceeds still more easily <i>by heating
magnesia with charcoal in a stream of chlorine</i>, when the charcoal serves
to take up the oxygen. This latter method is also employed for the preparation
of chlorides which are formed in an anhydrous condition with
still greater difficulty than magnesium chloride. Anhydrous magnesium
chloride forms a colourless, transparent mass, composed of flexible
crystalline plates of a pearly lustre. It fuses at a low red heat (708°)
into a colourless liquid, remains unchanged in a dry state, but under
the action of moisture is partially decomposed even at the ordinary
temperature, with formation of hydrochloric acid. When heated in the
presence of oxygen (air) it gives chlorine and the basic salt, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">[604]</a></span>
is formed with even greater facility under the action of heat in the
presence of steam, when HCl is formed, according to the equation
2MgCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = MgOMgCl<sub>2</sub> + 2HCl.<a name="FNanchor_34_BIS_862" id="FNanchor_34_BIS_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_BIS_862" class="fnanchor">[34 bis]</a></p>

<p><i>Calcium</i> (or the metal of lime) and its compounds in many respects
present a great resemblance to magnesium compounds, but are also
clearly distinguished from them by many properties.<a name="FNanchor_35_863" id="FNanchor_35_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_863" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> In general,
calcium stands to magnesium in the same relation as potassium occupies
in respect to sodium. Davy obtained metallic calcium, like potassium,
as an amalgam by the action of a galvanic current; but neither
charcoal nor iron decomposes calcium oxide, and even sodium decomposes
calcium chloride<a name="FNanchor_36_864" id="FNanchor_36_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_864" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> with difficulty. But a galvanic current easily
decomposes calcium chloride, and metallic sodium somewhat easily
decomposes calcium iodide when heated. As in the case of hydrogen,
potassium, and magnesium, the affinity of iodine for calcium is feebler
than that of chlorine (and oxygen), and therefore it is not surprising
that calcium iodide may be subjected to that decomposition, which the
chloride and oxide undergo with difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_37_865" id="FNanchor_37_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_865" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> <i>Metallic calcium</i> is of a
yellow colour, and has a considerable lustre, which it preserves in
dry air. Its specific gravity is 1·58. Calcium is distinguished by
its great ductility; it melts at a red heat and then burns in the air
with a very brilliant flame; the brilliancy is due to the formation of
finely divided infusible calcium oxide. Judging from the fact that
calcium in burning gives a very large flame, it is probable that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">[605]</a></span>
metal is volatile. Calcium decomposes water at the ordinary temperature,
and is oxidised in moist air, but not so rapidly as sodium.
In burning, it gives its oxide or <i>lime</i>, CaO, a substance which is
familiar to every one, and of which we have already frequently had
occasion to speak. This oxide is not met with in nature in a free
state, because it is an energetic base which everywhere encounters acid
substances forming salts with them. It is generally combined with
silica, or occurs as calcium carbonate or sulphate. The carbonate
and nitrate are decomposed, at a red heat, with the formation of lime.
As a rule, the carbonate, which is so frequently met with in nature,
serves as the source of the calcium oxide, both commercial and pure.
When heated, calcium carbonate dissociates: CaCO<sub>3</sub> = CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>.
In practice the decomposition is conducted at a bright red heat, in the
presence of steam, or a current of a foreign gas, in heaps or in special
kilns.<a name="FNanchor_38_866" id="FNanchor_38_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_866" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>Calcium oxide&mdash;that is, quicklime&mdash;is a substance (sp. gr. 3·15)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">[606]</a></span>
which is unaffected by heat,<a name="FNanchor_39_867" id="FNanchor_39_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_867" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and may therefore serve as a fire-resisting
material, and was employed by Deville for the construction
of furnaces in which platinum was melted, and silver volatilised by the
action of the heat evolved by the combustion of detonating gas. The
hydrated lime, slaked lime, or calcium hydroxide, CaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (specific
gravity 2·07) is a most common alkaline substance, employed largely
in building for making mortars or cements, in which case its binding
property is mainly due to the absorption of carbonic anhydride.<a name="FNanchor_40_868" id="FNanchor_40_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_868" class="fnanchor">[40]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">[607]</a></span>
Lime, like other alkalis, acts on many animal and vegetable substances,
and for this reason has many practical uses&mdash;for example,
for removing fats, and in agriculture for accelerating the decomposition
of organic substances in the so-called <i>composts</i> or accumulations
of vegetable and animal remains used for fertilising land.
Calcium hydroxide easily loses its water at a moderate heat (530°),
but it does not part with water at 100°. When mixed with water,
lime forms a pasty mass known as <i>slaked lime</i> and in a more
dilute form as <i>milk of lime</i>, because when shaken up in water it
remains suspended in it for a long time and presents the appearance
of a milky liquid. But, besides this, lime is directly soluble in water,
not to any considerable extent, but still in such a quantity that <i>lime
water</i> is precipitated by carbonic anhydride, and has clearly distinguishable
alkaline properties. One part of lime requires at the
ordinary temperature about 800 parts of water for solution. At 100°
it requires about 1500 parts of water, and therefore lime-water
becomes cloudy when boiled. If lime-water be evaporated in a
vacuum, calcium hydroxide separates in six-sided crystals.<a name="FNanchor_41_869" id="FNanchor_41_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_869" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> If
lime-water be mixed with hydrogen peroxide minute crystals of
<i>calcium peroxide</i>, CaO<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O, separate; this compound is very unstable
and, like barium peroxide, is decomposed by heat. Lime, as a
powerful base, combines with all acids, and in this respect presents a
transition from the true alkalis to magnesia. Many of the salts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">[608]</a></span>
calcium (the carbonate, phosphate, borate, and oxalate) are insoluble
in water; besides which the sulphate is only sparingly soluble. As
a more energetic base than magnesia, lime forms salts, CaX<sub>2</sub>, which
are distinguished by their stability in comparison with the salts
MgX<sub>2</sub>; neither does lime so easily form basic and double salts as
magnesia.</p>

<p>Anhydrous lime does not absorb dry carbonic anhydride at the
ordinary temperature. This was already known by Scheele, and Prof.
Schuliachenko showed that there is no absorption even at 360°. It
only proceeds at a red heat,<a name="FNanchor_42_870" id="FNanchor_42_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_870" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and then only leads to the formation
of a mixture of calcium oxide and carbonate (Rose). But if the
lime be slaked or dissolved, the absorption of carbonic anhydride
proceeds rapidly and completely. These phenomena are connected
with the <i>dissociation of calcium carbonate</i>, studied by Debray (1867)
under the influence of the conceptions of dissociation introduced
into science by Henri Saint-Claire Deville. Just as there is no
vapour tension for non-volatile substances, so there is no dissociation
tension of carbonic anhydride for calcium carbonate at the ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">[609]</a></span>
temperature. Just as every volatile substance has a maximum possible
vapour tension for every temperature, so also calcium carbonate has
its corresponding <i>dissociation tension</i>; this at 770° (the boiling point
of cadmium) is about 85 mm. (of the mercury column), and at 930° (the
boiling point of Zn) it is about 520 mm. As, if the tension be greater,
there will be no evaporation, so also there will he no decomposition.
Debray took crystals of calc spar, and could not observe the least change
in them at the boiling point of zinc (930°) in an atmosphere of carbonic
anhydride taken at the atmospheric pressure (760 mm.), whilst on the
other hand calcium carbonate may be completely decomposed at a
much lower temperature if the tension of the carbonic anhydride be
kept below the dissociation tension, which may be done either by
directly pumping away the gas with an air-pump, or by mixing it with
some other gas&mdash;that is, by diminishing the partial pressure of the
carbonic anhydride,<a name="FNanchor_43_871" id="FNanchor_43_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_871" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> just as an object may be dried at the ordinary
temperature by removing the aqueous vapour or by carrying it off in
a stream of another gas. Thus it is possible to obtain calcium carbonate
from lime and carbonic anhydride at a certain temperature above
that at which dissociation begins, and conversely to decompose calcium
carbonate at the same temperature into lime and carbonic anhydride.<a name="FNanchor_44_872" id="FNanchor_44_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_872" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
At the ordinary temperature the reaction of the first order (combination)
cannot proceed because the second (decomposition, dissociation)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">[610]</a></span>
cannot take place, and thus all the most important phenomena with respect
to the behaviour of lime towards carbonic anhydride are explained
by starting from one common basis.<a name="FNanchor_45_873" id="FNanchor_45_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_873" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p><i>Calcium carbonate</i>, CaCO<sub>3</sub>, is sometimes met with in nature in a
crystalline form, and it forms an example of the phenomenon termed
<i>dimorphism</i>&mdash;that is, it appears in two crystalline forms. When it
exhibits combinations of forms belonging to the hexagonal system (six-sided
prisms, rhombohedra, &amp;c.) it is called <i>calc spar</i>. Calc spar has a
specific gravity of 2·7, and is further characterised by a distinct cleavage
along the planes of the fundamental rhombohedron having an angle
of 105°. Perfectly transparent Iceland spar presents a clear example
of double refraction (for which reason it is frequently employed in
physical apparatus). The other form of calcium carbonate occurs in
crystals belonging to the rhombic system, and it is then called <i>aragonite</i>;
its specific gravity is 3·0. If calcium carbonate be artificially
produced by slow crystallisation at the ordinary temperature, it appears
in the rhombohedral form, but if the crystallisation be aided by heat it
then appears as aragonite. It may therefore be supposed that calc spar
presents the form corresponding with a low temperature, and aragonite
with a higher temperature during crystallisation.<a name="FNanchor_46_874" id="FNanchor_46_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_874" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">[611]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Calcium sulphate</i> in combination with two equivalents of water,
CaSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, is very widely distributed in nature, and is known as
<i>gypsum</i>. Gypsum loses one and a half and two equivalents of water at
a moderate temperature,<a name="FNanchor_47_875" id="FNanchor_47_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_875" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and anhydrous or burnt gypsum is then
obtained, which is also known as plaster of Paris, and is employed in
large quantities for modelling.<a name="FNanchor_48_876" id="FNanchor_48_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_876" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> This use depends on the fact that
burnt and finely-divided and sifted gypsum forms a paste when mixed
with water; after a certain time this paste becomes slightly heated and
solidifies, owing to the fact that the anhydrous calcium sulphate, CaSO<sub>4</sub>,
again combines with water. When the plaster of Paris and water are
first made into a paste they form a mechanical mixture, but when the
mass solidifies, then a compound of the calcium sulphate with two
molecules of water is produced; and this may be regarded as derived
from S(OH)<sub>6</sub> by the substitution of two atoms of hydrogen by one atom
of bivalent calcium. Natural gypsum sometimes appears as perfectly
colourless, or variegated, marble-like, masses, and sometimes in perfectly
colourless crystals, <i>selenite</i>, of specific gravity 2·33. The semi-transparent
gypsum, or <i>alabaster</i>, is often carved into small statues. Besides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">[612]</a></span>
which an anhydrous calcium sulphate, CaSO<sub>4</sub>, called <i>anhydrite</i> (specific
gravity 2·97), occurs in nature. It sometimes occurs along with gypsum.
It is no longer capable of combining directly with water, and differs
in this respect from the anhydrous salt obtained by gently igniting
gypsum. If gypsum be very strongly heated it shrinks and loses
its power of combining with water.<a name="FNanchor_48_BIS_877" id="FNanchor_48_BIS_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_BIS_877" class="fnanchor">[48 bis]</a> One part of calcium sulphate
requires at 0° 525 parts of water for solution, at 38° 466 parts, and at 100°
571 parts of water. The maximum solubility of gypsum is at about 36°,
which is nearly the same temperature as that at which sodium sulphate
is most soluble.<a name="FNanchor_49_878" id="FNanchor_49_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_878" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>As lime is a more energetic base than magnesia, so <i>calcium chloride</i>,
CaCl<sub>2</sub>, is not so easily decomposed by water, and its solutions only
disengage a small quantity of hydrochloric acid when evaporated, and
when the evaporation is conducted in a stream of hydrochloric acid it
easily gives an anhydrous salt which fuses at 719°; otherwise an
aqueous solution yields a crystallo-hydrate, CaCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, which melts
at 30°.<a name="FNanchor_50_879" id="FNanchor_50_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_879" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Just as for potassium, K = 39 (and sodium, Na = 23), there are
the near analogues, Rb = 85 and Cs = 133, and also another, Li = 7, so
in exactly the same manner for calcium, Ca = 40 (and magnesium,
Mg = 24), there is another analogue of lighter atomic weight,
beryllium, Be = 9, besides the near analogues strontium, Sr = 87, and
barium, Ba = 137. As rubidium and cæsium are more rarely met
with in nature than potassium, so also strontium and barium are rarer
than calcium (in the same way that bromine and iodine are rarer than
chlorine). Since they exhibit many points of resemblance with calcium,
strontium and barium may be characterised after a very short acquaintance
with their chief compounds; this shows the important advantages
gained by distributing the elements according to their natural groups,
to which matter we shall turn our attention in the next chapter.</p>

<p>Among the compounds of barium met with in nature the commonest
is the <i>sulphate</i>, BaSO<sub>4</sub>, which forms anhydrous crystals of the rhombic
system, which are identical in their crystalline form with anhydrite,
and generally occur as transparent and semi-transparent masses of
tabular crystals having a high specific gravity, namely 4·45, for which
reason this salt bears the name of <i>heavy spar</i> or <i>barytes</i>. Analogous to
it is <i>celestine</i>, SrSO<sub>4</sub>, which is, however, more rarely met with. Heavy
spar frequently forms the gangue separated on dressing metallic ores
from the vein stuff; this mineral is the source of all other barium
compounds; for the carbonate, although more easily transformed
into the other compounds (because acids act directly on it, evolving
carbonic anhydride), is a comparatively rare mineral (BaCO<sub>3</sub> forms
the mineral <i>witherite</i>; SrCO<sub>3</sub>, <i>strontianite</i>; both are rare, the
latter is found at Etna). The treatment of barium sulphate is
rendered difficult from the fact that it is insoluble both in water and
acids, and has therefore to be treated by a method of reduction.<a name="FNanchor_51_880" id="FNanchor_51_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_880" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Like sodium sulphate and calcium sulphate, heavy spar when heated
with charcoal parts with its oxygen and forms barium sulphide, BaS.
For this purpose a pasty mixture of powdered heavy spar, charcoal,
and tar is subjected to the action of a strong heat, when BaSO<sub>4</sub>
+ 4C = BaS + 4CO. The residue is then treated with water, in which
the barium sulphide is soluble.<a name="FNanchor_52_881" id="FNanchor_52_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_881" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> When boiled with hydrochloric acid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">[615]</a></span>
barium chloride, BaCl<sub>2</sub>, is obtained in solution, and the sulphur is disengaged
as gaseous sulphuretted hydrogen, BaS + 2HCl = BaCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>S.
In this manner barium sulphate is converted into barium chloride,<a name="FNanchor_53_882" id="FNanchor_53_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_882" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
and the latter by double decomposition with strong nitric acid or
nitre gives the less soluble barium nitrate, Ba(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,<a name="FNanchor_54_883" id="FNanchor_54_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_883" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> or with sodium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">[616]</a></span>
carbonate a precipitate of barium carbonate, BaCO<sub>3</sub>. Both these salts
are able to give <i>barium oxide</i>, or <i>baryta</i>, BaO, and the hydroxide,
Ba(HO)<sub>2</sub>, which differs from lime by its great solubility in water,<a name="FNanchor_55_884" id="FNanchor_55_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_884" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
and by the ease with which it forms a crystallo-hydrate, BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>,8H<sub>2</sub>O,
from its solutions. Owing to its solubility, baryta is frequently
employed in manufactures and in practical chemistry as an alkali
which has the very important property that it may be always entirely
removed from solution by the addition of sulphuric acid, which entirely
separates it as the insoluble barium sulphate, BaSO<sub>4</sub>. It may also be
removed whilst it remains in an alkaline state (for example, the
excess which may remain when it is used for saturating acids) by
means of carbonic anhydride, which also completely precipitates baryta
as a sparingly soluble, colourless, and powdery carbonate. Both these
reactions show that baryta has such properties as would very greatly
extend its use were its compounds as widely distributed as those of
sodium and calcium, and were its soluble compounds not poisonous.
Barium nitrate is directly decomposed by the action of heat, barium
oxide being left behind. The same takes place with barium carbonate,
especially that form of it precipitated from solutions, and
when mixed with charcoal or ignited in an atmosphere of steam.
Barium oxide combines with water with the development of a large
amount of heat, and the resultant hydroxide is very stable in its retention
of the water, although it parts with it when strongly ignited.<a name="FNanchor_55_BIS_885" id="FNanchor_55_BIS_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_BIS_885" class="fnanchor">[55 bis]</a>
With oxygen the anhydrous oxide gives, as already mentioned in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">[617]</a></span>
Chapters <a href="#Page_152">III</a>. and <a href="#Page_198">IV</a>., a <i>peroxide</i>, BaO<sub>2</sub>.<a name="FNanchor_56_886" id="FNanchor_56_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_886" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> Neither calcium nor
strontium oxides are able to give such a peroxide directly, but they
form peroxides under the action of hydrogen peroxide.</p>

<p>Barium oxide is decomposed when heated with potassium; fused
barium chloride is decomposed, as Davy showed, by the action of a
galvanic current, forming metallic <i>barium</i>; and Crookes (1862) obtained
an amalgam of barium from which the mercury could easily be driven
off, by heating sodium amalgam in a saturated solution of barium
chloride. Strontium is obtained by the same processes. Both metals
are soluble in mercury, and seem to be non-volatile or only very slightly
volatile. They are both heavier than water; the specific gravity
of barium is 3·6, and of strontium 2·5. They both decompose water at
the ordinary temperature, like the metals of the alkalis.</p>

<p>Barium and strontium as saline elements are characterised by their
powerful basic properties, so that they form acid salts with difficulty,
and scarcely form basic salts. On comparing them together and with
calcium, it is evident that the alkaline properties in this group (as in
the group potassium, rubidium, cæsium) increase with the atomic
weight, and this succession clearly shows itself in many of their corresponding
compounds. Thus, for instance, the solubility of the
hydroxides RH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the specific gravity<a name="FNanchor_57_887" id="FNanchor_57_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_887" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> rise in passing from
calcium to strontium and barium, while the solubility of the sulphates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">[618]</a></span>
decreases,<a name="FNanchor_58_888" id="FNanchor_58_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_888" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> and therefore in the case of magnesium and beryllium, as
metals whose atomic weights are still less, we should expect the solubility
of the sulphates to be greater, and this is in reality the case.</p>

<p>Just as in the series of the alkali metals we saw the metals potassium,
rubidium, and cæsium approaching near to each other in their
properties, and allied to them two metals having smaller combining
weights&mdash;namely, sodium, and the lightest of all, lithium, which all
exhibited certain peculiar characteristic properties&mdash;so also in the case
of the metals of the alkaline earths we find, besides calcium, barium,
and strontium, the metal magnesium and also <i>beryllium</i> or <i>glucinum</i>.
In respect to the magnitude of its atomic weight, this last occupies the
same position in the series of the metals of the alkaline earths as lithium
does in the series of the alkali metals, for the combining weight of
beryllium, Be or Gl = 9. This combining weight is greater than that
of lithium (7), as the combining weight of magnesium (24) is greater
than that of sodium (23), and as that of calcium (40) is greater than
that of potassium (39), &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_59_889" id="FNanchor_59_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_889" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Beryllium was so named because it occurs
in the mineral <i>beryl</i>. The metal is also called glucinum (from the
Greek word &#947;&#955;&#965;&#954;&#8059;&#962;, &lsquo;sweet&rsquo;), because its salts have a sweet taste. It
occurs in beryl, aquamarine, the emerald, and other minerals, which
are generally of a green colour; they are sometimes found in considerable
masses, but as a rule are comparatively rare and, as transparent
crystals, form precious stones. The composition of beryl and of the
emerald is as follows: Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>,3BeO,6SiO<sub>2</sub>. The Siberian and Brazilian
beryls are the best known. The specific gravity of beryl is about 2·7.
Beryllium oxide, from the feebleness of its basic properties, presents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">[619]</a></span>
an analogy to aluminium oxide in the same way that lithium oxide is
analogous to magnesium oxide.<a name="FNanchor_60_890" id="FNanchor_60_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_890" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Owing to its rare occurrence in nature,
to the absence of any especially distinct individual properties, and to
the possibility of foretelling them to a certain extent on the basis of the
periodic system of the elements given in the following chapter, and
owing to the brevity of this treatise, we will not discuss at any length
the compounds of beryllium, and will only observe that their
individuality was pointed out in 1798 by Vauquelin, and that
metallic beryllium was obtained by Wöhler and Bussy. Wöhler
obtained <i>metallic beryllium</i> (like magnesium) by acting on beryllium
chloride, BeCl<sub>2</sub>, with potassium (it is best prepared by fusing
K<sub>2</sub>BeF<sub>4</sub> with Na). Metallic beryllium has a specific gravity 1·64
(Nilson and Pettersson). It is very infusible, melting at nearly
the same temperature as silver, which it resembles in its white
colour and lustre. It is characterised by the fact that it is very difficultly
oxidised, and even in the oxidising flame of the blowpipe is only
superficially covered by a coating of oxide; it does not burn in pure
oxygen, and does not decompose water at the ordinary temperature or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">[620]</a></span>
at a red heat, but gaseous hydrochloric acid is decomposed by it when
slightly heated, with evolution of hydrogen and development of a considerable
amount of heat. Even dilute hydrochloric acid acts in the
same manner at the ordinary temperature. Beryllium also acts easily
on sulphuric acid, but it is remarkable that neither dilute nor strong
nitric acid acts on beryllium, which seems especially able to resist
oxidising agents. Potassium hydroxide acts on beryllium as on
aluminium, hydrogen being disengaged and the metal dissolved, but
ammonia has no action on it. These properties of metallic beryllium
seem to isolate it from the series of the other metals described in this
chapter, but if we compare the properties of calcium, magnesium, and
beryllium we shall see that magnesium occupies a position intermediate
between the other two. Whilst calcium decomposes water with great
ease, magnesium does so with difficulty, and beryllium not at all. The
peculiarities of beryllium among the metals of the alkaline earths recall
the fact that in the series of the halogens we saw that fluorine differed
from the other halogens in many of its properties and had the smallest
atomic weight. The same is the case with regard to beryllium among
the other metals of the alkaline earths.</p>

<p>In addition to the above characteristics of the compounds of the
metals of the alkaline earths, we must add that they, like the
alkali metals, combine with nitrogen and hydrogen, and while sodium
nitride (obtained by igniting the amide of sodium, Chapter XII.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_44_BIS_768">44 bis</a>) and lithium nitride (obtained by heating lithium in nitrogen,
Chapter XIII., Note <a href="#Footnote_39_820">39</a>) have the composition R<sub>3</sub>N, so the nitrides
of magnesium (Note <a href="#Footnote_14_841">14</a>), calcium, strontium, and barium have the
composition R<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, for example, Ba<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub>, as might be expected from the
diatomicity of the metals of the alkaline earths and from the relation of
the nitrides to ammonia, which is obtained from all of these compounds
by the action of water. The <i>nitrides</i> of Ca, Sr, and Ba are formed
directly (Maquenne, 1892) by heating the metals in nitrogen. They all
have the appearance of an amorphous powder of dark colour; as
regards their reactions, it is known that besides disengaging ammonia
with water, they form cyanides when heated with carbonic oxide; for
instance, Ba<sub>3</sub>N<sub>2</sub> + 2CO = Ba(CN)<sub>2</sub> + 2BaO.<a name="FNanchor_61_891" id="FNanchor_61_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_891" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>The metals of the alkaline earths, just like Na and K, absorb
hydrogen under certain conditions, and form pulverulent easily oxidisable
metallic hydrides, whose composition corresponds exactly to that
of Na<sub>2</sub>H and K<sub>2</sub>H, with the substitution of K<sub>2</sub> and Na<sub>2</sub> by the atoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">[621]</a></span>
Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba. The <i>hydrides of the metals of the alkaline
earths</i> were discovered by C. Winkler (1891) in investigating the
reducibility of these metals by magnesium. In reducing their oxides
by heating them with magnesium powder in a stream of hydrogen,
Winkler observed that the hydrogen was absorbed (but very slowly), <i>i.e.</i>
at the moment of their separation all the metals of the alkaline earths
combine with hydrogen. This absorptive power increases in passing
from Be to Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, and the resultant hydrides retain the
combined hydrogen<a name="FNanchor_62_892" id="FNanchor_62_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_892" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> when heated, so that these hydrides are distinguished
for their considerable stability under heat, but they oxidise
very easily.<a name="FNanchor_63_893" id="FNanchor_63_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_893" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>Thus the analogies and correlation of the metals of these two groups
are now clearly marked, not only in their behaviour towards oxygen,
chlorine, acids, &amp;c., but also in their capability of combining with
nitrogen and hydrogen.</p>

salts of the oxide, and 0·0006526 gram from the salts of the suboxide, &amp;c. These amounts
stand in the same ratio as the equivalents, <i>i.e.</i> as the quantities replaced by one part by
weight of hydrogen. The intimate bond which is becoming more and more marked
existing between the electrolytic and purely chemical relations of substances (especially
in solutions) and the application of electrolysis to the preparation of numerous substances
on a large scale, together with the employment of electricity for obtaining high
temperatures, &amp;c., makes me regret that the plan and dimensions of this book, and the
impossibility of giving a concise and objective exposition of the necessary electrical facts,
prevent my entering upon this province of knowledge, although I consider it my
duty to recommend its study to all those who desire to take part in the further development
of our science.</p>

<p>There is only one side of the subject respecting the direct correlation between thermochemical
data and electro-motive force, which I think right to mention here, as it
justifies the general conception, enunciated by Faraday, that the galvanic current is an
aspect of the transference of chemical motion or reaction along the conductors.</p>

<p>From experiments conducted by Favre, Thomsen, Garni, Berthelot, Cheltzoff, and
others, upon the amount of heat evolved in a closed circuit, it follows that the electro-motive
force of the current or its capacity to do a certain work, E, is proportional to the
whole amount of heat, Q, disengaged by the reaction forming the source of the current.
If E be expressed in volts, and Q in thousands of units of heat referred to equivalent
weights, then E = 0·0436Q. For example in a Daniells battery E = 1·09 both by experiment
and theory, because in it there takes place the decomposition of CuSO<sub>4</sub> into Cu + O
together with the formation of Zn + O and ZnO + SO<sub>3</sub>Aq, and these reactions correspond
to Q = 25·06 thousand units of heat. So also in all other primary batteries (<i>e.g.</i> Bunsen's,
Poggendorff's, &amp;c.) and secondary ones (for instance, those acting according to the
reaction Pb + H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + PbO<sub>2</sub>, as Cheltzoff showed) E = 0·0436Q.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_830" id="Footnote_3_830"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_830"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> The chief means by which we determine the valency of the elements, or what
multiple of the equivalent should be ascribed to the atom, are: (1) The law of Avogadro-Gerhardt.
This method is the most general and trustworthy, and has already been
applied to a great number of elements. (2) The different grades of oxidation and their
isomorphism or analogy in general; for example, Fe = 56 because the suboxide (ferrous
oxide) is isomorphous with magnesium oxide, &amp;c., and the oxide (ferric oxide) contains
half as much oxygen again as the suboxide. Berzelius, Marignac, and others took advantage
of this method for determining the composition of the compounds of many elements.
(3) The specific heat, according to Dulong and Petit's law. Regnault, and more especially
Cannizzaro, used this method to distinguish univalent from bivalent metals. (4) The
periodic law (<i>see</i> Chapter XV.) has served as a means for the determination of the
atomic weights of cerium, uranium, yttrium, &amp;c., and more especially of gallium,
scandium, and germanium. The correction of the results of one method by those
of others is generally had recourse to, and is quite necessary, because, phenomena of
dissociation, polymerisation, &amp;c., may complicate the individual determinations by each
method.</p>

<p>It will be well to observe that a number of other methods, especially from the province
of those physical properties which are clearly dependent on the magnitude of the atom
(or equivalent) or of the molecule, may lead to the same result. I may point out, for
instance, that even the specific gravity of solutions of the metallic chlorides may serve
for this purpose. Thus, if beryllium he taken as trivalent&mdash;that is, if the composition of
its chloride be taken as BeCl<sub>3</sub> (or a polymeride of it), then the specific gravity of
solutions of beryllium chloride will not fit into the series of the other metallic chlorides.
But by ascribing to it an atomic weight Be = 7, or taking Be as bivalent, and the composition
of its chloride as BeCl<sub>2</sub>, we arrive at the general rule given in Chapter VII., Note <a href="#Footnote_28_438">28</a>.
Thus W. G. Burdakoff determined in my laboratory that the specific gravity at 15°/4°
of the solution BeCl<sub>2</sub> + 200H<sub>2</sub>O = 1·0138&mdash;that is, greater than the corresponding solution
KCl + 200H<sub>2</sub>O (= 1·0121), and less than the solution MgCl<sub>2</sub> + 200H<sub>2</sub>O (= 1·0203), as would
follow from the magnitude of the molecular weight BeCl<sub>2</sub> = 80, since KCl = 74·5 and
MgCl<sub>2</sub> = 95.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_831" id="Footnote_4_831"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_831"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The specific heats here given refer to different limits of temperature, but in the
majority of cases between 0° and 100°; only in the case of bromine the specific heat is
taken (for the solid state) at a temperature below -7°, according to Regnault's determination.
<i>The variation of the specific heat with a change of temperature</i> is a
very complex phenomenon, the consideration of which I think would here be out of place.
I will only cite a few figures as an example. According to Bystrom, the specific heat of
iron at 0° = 0·1116, at 100° = 0·1114, at 200° = 0·1188, at 300° = 0·1267, and at 1,400°
= 0·4031. Between these last limits of temperature a change takes place in iron (a spontaneous
heating, <i>recalescence</i>), as we shall see in Chapter XXII. For quartz SiO<sub>2</sub>
Pionchon gives Q = 0·1737 + 394<i>t</i>10<sup>-6</sup> - 27<i>t</i><sup>2</sup>10<sup>-9</sup> up to 400°, for metallic aluminium
(Richards, 1892) at 0° 0·222, at 20° 0·224, at 100° 0·232; consequently, as a rule,
the specific heat varies slightly with the temperature. Still more remarkable are
H. E. Weber's observations on the great variation of the specific heat of charcoal, the
diamond and boron:</p>

<p>These determinations, which have been verified by Dewar, Le Chatelier (Chapter VIII.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_13_455">13</a>), Moissan, and Gauthier, the latter finding for boron AQ = 6 at 400°, are of especial
importance as confirming the universality of Dulong and Petit's law, because the
elements mentioned above form exceptions to the general rule when the mean specific
heat is taken for temperatures between 0° and 100°. Thus in the case of the diamond
the product of A × Q at 0° = 1·2, and for boron = 2·4. But if we take the specific heat
towards which there is evidently a tendency with a rise of temperature, we obtain
a product approaching to 6 as with other elements. Thus with the diamond and
charcoal, it is evident that the specific heat tends towards 0·47, which multiplied by 12
gives 5·6, the same as for magnesium and aluminium. I may here direct the reader's
attention to the fact that for solid elements having a small atomic weight, the specific
heat varies considerably if we take the average figures for temperatures 0° to 100°:</p>

<p>It is therefore clear that the specific heat of beryllium determined at a low temperature
cannot serve for establishing its atomicity. On the other hand, the low atomic heat of
charcoal, graphite, and the diamond, boron, &amp;c., may perhaps depend on the complexity
of the molecules of these elements. The necessity for acknowledging a great complexity
of the molecules of carbon was explained in Chapter <a href="#Page_338">VIII</a>. In the case of sulphur the
molecule contains at least S<sub>6</sub> and its atomic heat = 32 × 0·163 = 5·22, which is distinctly
below the normal. If a large number of atoms of carbon are contained in the molecule
of charcoal, this would to a certain extent account for its comparatively small atomic
heat. With respect to the specific heat of compounds, it will not be out of place to
mention here the conclusion arrived at by Kopp, that the molecular heat (that is, the
product of MQ) may be looked on as the sum of the atomic heats of its component
elements; but as this rule is not a general one, and can only be applied to give an approximate
estimate of the specific heats of substances, I do not think it necessary to go into
the details of the conclusions described in Liebig's &lsquo;Annalen Supplement-Band,&rsquo; 1864,
which includes a number of determinations made by Kopp.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_832" id="Footnote_5_832"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_832"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> It must be remarked that in the case of oxygen (and also hydrogen and carbon)
compounds the quotient of MQ/<i>n</i>, where <i>n</i> is the number of atoms in the molecule, is
always less than 6 for solids; for example, for MgO = 5·0, CuO = 5·1, MnO<sub>2</sub> = 4·6, ice
(Q = 0·504) = 3, SiO<sub>2</sub> = 3·5, &amp;c. At present it is impossible to say whether this depends
on the smaller specific heat of the atom of oxygen in its solid compounds (Kopp, Note <a href="#Footnote_4_831">4</a>)
or on some other cause; but, nevertheless, taking into account this decrease depending
on the presence of oxygen, a reflection of the atomicity of the elements may to a certain
extent be seen in the specific heat of the oxides. Thus for alumina, Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Q = 0·217),
MQ = 22·3, and therefore the quotient MQ/<i>n</i> = 4·5, which is nearly that given by
magnesium oxide, MgO. But if we ascribe the same composition to alumina, as to
magnesia&mdash;that is, if aluminium were counted as divalent&mdash;we should obtain the figure
3·7, which is much less. In general, in compounds of identical atomic composition
and of analogous chemical properties the molecular heats MQ are nearly equal, as
many investigators have long remarked. For example, ZnS = 11·7 and HgS = 11·8;
MgSO<sub>4</sub> = 27·0 and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> = 28·0, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_833" id="Footnote_6_833"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_833"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> If W be the amount of heat contained in a mass <i>m</i> of a substance at a temperature
<i>t</i>, and <i>d</i>W the amount expended in heating it from <i>t</i> to <i>t</i> + <i>dt</i>, then the specific heat
Q = <i>d</i>W(<i>m</i> × <i>dt</i>). The specific heat not only varies with the composition and complexity
of the molecules of a substance, but also with the temperature, pressure, and physical
state of a substance. Even for gases the variation of Q with <i>t</i> is to be observed. Thus
it is seen from the experiments of Regnault and Wiedemann that the specific heat of
carbonic anhydride at 0° = 0·19, at 100° = 0·22, and at 200° = 0·24. But the variation of
the specific heat of permanent gases with the temperature is, as far as we know, very inconsiderable.
According to Mallard and Le Chatelier it is =

<span class="fraction">
<span class="fup">0·0006</span>
<span class="bar">/</span>
<span class="fdn">M</span>
</span>

per 1°, where M is
the molecular weight (for instance, for O<sub>2</sub>, M = 32). Therefore the specific heat of those
permanent gases which contain two atoms in the molecule (H<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, CO, and NO)
may be, as is shown by experiment, taken as not varying with the temperature. The
constancy of the specific heat of perfect gases forms one of the fundamental propositions
of the whole theory of heat and on it depends the determination of temperatures by means
of gas-thermometers containing hydrogen, nitrogen, or air. Le Chatelier (1887), on the
basis of existing determinations, concludes that the molecular heat&mdash;that is, the
product MQ&mdash;of all gases varies in proportion to the temperature, and tends to become
equal (= 6·8) at the temperature of absolute zero (that is, at -273°); and therefore
MQ = 6·8 + <i>a</i>(273 + <i>t</i>), where <i>a</i> is a constant quantity which increases with the complexity
of the gaseous molecule and Q is the specific heat of the gas under a constant pressure.
For permanent gases <i>a</i> almost = 0, and therefore MQ = 6·8&mdash;that is, the atomic heat (if the
molecule contains two atoms) = 3·4, as it is in fact (Chapter IX., Note <a href="#Footnote_17_BIS_528">17 bis</a>. As regards
liquids (as well as the vapours formed by them), the specific heat always rises with the
temperature. Thus for benzene it equals 0·38 + 0·0014<i>t</i>. R. Schiff (1887) showed that the
variation of the specific heat of many organic liquids is proportional to the change of
temperature (as in the case of gases, according to Le Chatelier), and reduced these
variations into dependence with their composition and absolute boiling point. It is very
probable that the theory of liquids will make use of these simple relations which recall
the simplicity of the variation of the specific gravity (Chapter II., Note <a href="#Footnote_34_158">34</a>), cohesion,
and other properties of liquids with the temperature. They are all expressed by the
linear function of the temperature, <i>a</i> + <i>bt</i>, with the same degree of proximity as the property
of gases is expressed by the equation <i>pv</i> = <i>Rt</i>.</p>

<p>As regards the relation between the specific heats of liquids (or of solids) and of their
vapours, the specific heat of the vapour (and also of the solid) is always less than that
of the liquid. For example, benzene vapour 0·22, liquid 0·38; chloroform vapour 0·13,
liquid 0·23; steam 0·475, liquid water 1·0. But the complexity of the relations existing
in specific heat is seen from the fact that the specific heat of ice = 0·502 is less
than that of liquid water. According to Regnault, in the case of bromine the specific
heat of the vapour = 0·055 at (150°), of the liquid = 0·107 (at 30°), and of solid bromine
= 0·084 (at -15°). The specific heat of solid benzoic acid (according to experiment and
calculation, Hess, 1888) between 0° and 100° is 0·31, and of liquid benzoic acid 0·50.
One of the problems of the present day is the explanation of those complex relations
which exist between the composition and such properties as specific heat, latent heat,
expansion by heat, compression, internal friction, cohesion, and so forth. They can
only be connected by a complete theory of liquids, which may now soon be expected,
more especially as many sides of the subject have already been partially explained.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_834" id="Footnote_7_834"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_834"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> According to the above reasons the quantity of heat, Q, required to raise the temperature
of one part by weight of a substance by one degree may be expressed by the
sum Q = K + B + D, where K is the heat actually expended in heating the substance, or
what is termed the absolute specific heat, B the amount of heat expended in the
internal work accomplished with the rise of temperature, and D the amount of heat expended
in external work. In the case of gases the last quantity may be easily determined,
knowing their coefficient of expansion, which is approximately = 0·00368. By
applying to this case the same argument given at the end of Note <a href="#Footnote_11_57">11</a>, Chapter I., we find
that one cubic metre of a gas heated 1° produces an external work of 10333 × 0·00368,
or 38·02 kilogrammetres, on which 38·02/424 or 0·0897 heat units are expended. This is
the heat expended for the external work produced by one cubic metre of a gas, but the
specific heat refers to units of weight, and therefore it is necessary in order to know D
to reduce the above quantity to a unit of weight. One cubic metre of hydrogen at 0°
and 760 mm. pressure weighs 0·0896 kilo, a gas of molecular weight M has a density
M/2, consequently a cubic metre weighs (at 0° and 760 mm.) 0·0448M kilo, and therefore
1 kilogram of the gas occupies a volume 1/0·0448M cubic metres, and hence the external
work D in the heating of 1 kilo of the given gas through 1° = 0·0896/0·0448M, or D = 2/M.</p>

<p>Taking the magnitude of the internal work B for gases as negligible if permanent gases
are taken, and therefore supposing B = 0, we find the specific heat of gases at a constant
pressure Q = K + 2 M, where K is the specific heat at a constant volume, or the true
specific heat, and M the molecular weight. Hence K = Q - 2/M. The magnitude of the
specific heat Q is given by direct experiment. According to Regnault's experiments, for
oxygen it = 0·2175, for hydrogen 3·405, for nitrogen 0·2438; the molecular weights of
these gases are 32, 2, and 28, and therefore for oxygen K = 0·2175 - 0·0625 = 0·1550,
for hydrogen K = 3·4050 - 1·000 = 2·4050, and for nitrogen K = 0·2438 - 0·0714 = 0·1724.
These true specific heats of elements are in inverse proportion to their atomic weights&mdash;that
is, their product by the atomic weight is a constant quantity. In fact, for oxygen
this product = 0·155 × 16 = 2·48, for hydrogen 2·40, for nitrogen 0·7724 × 14 = 2·414, and
therefore if A stand for the atomic weight we obtain the expression K × A = a constant,
which may be taken as 2·45. This is the true expression of Dulong and Petit's law,
because K is the true specific heat and A the weight of the atom. It should be remarked,
moreover, that the product of the observed specific heat Q into A is also a constant
quantity (for oxygen = 3·48, for hydrogen = 3·40), because the external work D is also
inversely proportional to the atomic weight.</p>

<p>In the case of gases we distinguish the specific heat at a constant pressure <i>c&#8242;</i> (we
designated this quantity above by Q), and at a constant volume <i>c</i>. It is evident that
<i>the relation between the two specific heats, k</i>, judging from the above, is the ratio of Q
to K, or equal to the ratio of 2·45<i>n</i> + 2 to 2·45<i>n</i>. When <i>n</i> = 1 this ratio <i>k</i> = 1·8; when
<i>n</i> = 2, <i>k</i> = 1·4, when <i>n</i> = 3, <i>k</i> = 1·3, and with an exceedingly large number <i>n</i>, of atoms in the
molecule, <i>k</i> = 1. That is, the ratio between the specific heats decreases from 1·8 to 1·0
as the number of atoms, <i>n</i>, contained in the molecule increases. This deduction is
verified to a certain extent by direct experiment. For such gases as hydrogen, oxygen,
nitrogen, carbonic oxide, air, and others in which <i>n</i> = 2, the magnitude of <i>k</i> is determined
by methods described in works on physics (for example, by the change of temperature
with an alteration of pressure, by the velocity of sound, &amp;c.) and is found in reality to
be nearly 1·4, and for such gases as carbonic anhydride, nitric dioxide, and others it is
nearly 1·3. Kundt and Warburg (1875), by means of the approximate method mentioned
in Note <a href="#Footnote_29_440">29</a>, Chapter VII., determined <i>k</i> for mercury vapour when <i>n</i> = 1, and found it to
be = 1·67&mdash;that is, a larger quantity than for air, as would be expected from the above.</p>

<p>It may be admitted that the true atomic heat of gases = 2·43, only under the condition
that they are distant from a liquid state, and do not undergo a chemical change when
heated&mdash;that is, when no internal work is produced in them (B = 0). Therefore this
work may to a certain extent be judged by the observed specific heat. Thus, for instance,
for chlorine (Q = 0·12, Regnault; <i>k</i> = 1·33, according to Straker and Martin, and therefore
K = 0·09, MK = 6·4), the atomic heat (3·2) is much greater than for other gases containing
two atoms in a molecule, and it must be assumed, therefore, that when it is heated some
great internal work is accomplished.</p>

<p>In order to generalise the facts concerning the specific heat of gases and solids, it
appears to me possible to accept the following general proposition: <i>the atomic heat</i>
(that is, AQ or QM/<i>n</i>, where M is the molecular weight and <i>n</i> the number of molecules) is
<i>smaller</i> (in solids it attains its highest value 6·8 and in gases 3·4), <i>the more complex the
molecule</i> (i.e. <i>the greater the number (n) of atoms forming it</i>) <i>and so much smaller, up
to a certain point</i> (in similar physical states) <i>the smaller the mean atomic weight M/n</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_835" id="Footnote_8_835"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_835"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> As an example, it will be sufficient to refer to the specific heat of nitrogen tetroxide,
N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, which, when heated, gradually passes into NO<sub>2</sub>&mdash;that is, chemical work of decomposition
proceeds, which consumes heat. Speaking generally, specific heat is a complex
quantity, in which it is clear that thermal data (for instance, the heat of reaction) alone
cannot give an idea either of chemical or of physical changes individually, but always
depend on an association of the one and the other. If a substance be heated from <i>t</i><sub>0</sub>
to <i>t</i><sub>1</sub> it cannot but suffer a chemical change (that is, the state of the atoms in the molecules
changes more or less in one way or another) if dissociation sets in at a temperature
<i>t</i><sub>1</sub>. Even in the case of the elements whose molecules contain only one atom,
a true chemical change is possible with a rise of temperature, because more heat is
evolved in chemical reactions than that quantity which participates in purely physical
changes. One gram of hydrogen (specific heat = 3·4 at a constant pressure) cooled to the
temperature of absolute zero will evolve altogether about one thousand units of heat,
8 grams of oxygen half this amount, whilst in combining together they evolve in the
formation of 9 grams of water more than thirty times as much heat. Hence the store
of chemical energy (that is, of the motion of the atoms, vortex, or other) is much greater
than the physical store proper to the molecules, but it is the change accomplished by
the former that is the cause of chemical transformations. Here we evidently touch on
those limits of existing knowledge beyond which the teaching of science does not yet
allow us to pass. Many new scientific discoveries have still to be made before this is
possible.</p></div>

changes which it produces in the soil, as a particularly powerful base which aids the
alteration of the mineral and organic elements of the soil.</p></div>

feebly, probably for two reasons. In the first place, because the reaction Mg + O develops
more heat (about 140 thousand calories) than K<sub>2</sub> + O or Na<sub>2</sub> + O (about 100 thousand
calories); and, in the second place, because magnesia is not fusible at the heat of a
furnace and cannot act on the charcoal, sodium, or potassium&mdash;that is, it does not pass
into that mobile state which is necessary for reaction. The first reason alone is not
sufficient to explain the absence of the reaction between charcoal and magnesia, because
iron and charcoal in combining with oxygen evolve less heat than sodium or potassium,
yet, nevertheless, they can displace them. With respect to magnesium chloride, it acts
on sodium and potassium, not only because their combination with chlorine evolves more
heat than the combination of chlorine and magnesium (Mg + Cl<sub>2</sub> gives 150 and Na<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub>
about 195 thousand calories), but also because a fusion, both of the magnesium chloride
and of the double salt, takes place under the action of heat. It is probable, however,
that a reverse reaction will take place. A reverse reaction might probably be expected, and
Winkler (1890) showed that Mg reduces the oxides of the alkali metals (Chapter XIII.,

(although this does not embrace the whole essence of the matter) to consider that one of
the metals of such salts (for instance, potassium) easily gives acid salts, and the other
(in this instance, magnesium) basic salts; the properties of distinctly basic elements predominate
in the former, whilst in the latter these properties are enfeebled, and the
salts formed by them bear the character of acids&mdash;for example, the salts of aluminium

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_852" id="Footnote_25_852"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_852"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> The component parts of certain double salts diffuse at different rates, and as the
diffused solution contains a different proportion of the component salts than the
solution taken of the double salt, it shows that such salts are decomposed by water.
According to Rüdorff, the double salts, like carnallite, MgK<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, and the alums,
all belong to this order (1888). But such salts as tartar emetic, the double oxalates, and
double cyanides are not separated by diffusion, which in all probability depends both on
the relative rate of the diffusion of the component salts and on the degree of affinity
acting between them. Those complex states of equilibrium which exist between water,
the individual salts MX and NY, and the double salt MNXY, have been already partially
analysed (as will be shown hereafter) in that case when the system is heterogeneous
(that is, when something separates out in a solid state from the liquid solution), but in
the case of equilibria in a homogeneous liquid medium (in a solution) the phenomenon is
not so clear, because it concerns that very theory of solution which cannot yet be
considered as established (Chapter I., Note <a href="#Footnote_9_55">9</a>, and others). As regards the heterogeneous
decomposition of double salts, it has long been known that such salts as carnallite and
K<sub>2</sub>Mg(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> give up the more soluble salt if an insufficient quantity of water for their
complete solution be taken. The complete saturation of 100 parts of water requires at
0° 14·1, at 20° 25, and at 60° 50·2 parts of the latter double salt (anhydrous), while 100
parts of water dissolve 27 parts of magnesium sulphate at 0°, 36 parts at 20°, and 55
parts at 60°, of the anhydrous salt taken. Of all the states of equilibrium exhibited by
double salts the most fully investigated as yet is the system containing water, sodium
sulphate, magnesium sulphate, and their double salt, Na<sub>2</sub>Mg(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, which crystallises
with 4 and 6 mol. OH<sub>2</sub>. The first crystallo-hydrate, MgNa<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, occurs at
Stassfurt, and as a sedimentary deposit in many of the salt lakes near Astrakhan, and is
therefore called <i>astrakhanite</i>. The specific gravity of the monoclinic prisms of this salt
is 2·22. If this salt, in a finely divided state, be mixed with the necessary quantity of water
(according to the equation MgNa<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O + 13H<sub>2</sub>O = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O + MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O),
the mixture solidifies like plaster of Paris into a homogeneous mass if the temperature
be <i>below</i> 22° (Van't Hoff und Van Deventer, 1886; Bakhuis Roozeboom, 1887); but
if the temperature be above this <i>transition-point</i> the water and double salt do
not react on each other: that is, they do not solidify or give a mixture of sodium
and magnesium sulphates. If a mixture (in equivalent quantities) of solutions of these
salts be evaporated, and crystals of astrakhanite and of the individual salts capable of
proceeding from it be added to the concentrated solution to avoid the possibility of a
supersaturated solution, then at temperatures above 22° astrakhanite is exclusively
formed (this is the method of its production), but at lower temperatures the individual
salts are alone produced. If equivalent amounts of Glauber's salt and magnesium
sulphate be mixed together in a solid state, there is no change at temperatures below
22°, but at higher temperatures astrakhanite and water are formed. The volume
occupied by Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O in grams = 322/1·46 = 220·5 cubic centimetres, and by
MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O = 246/1·68 = 146·4 c.c.; hence their mixture in equivalent quantities occupies a
volume of 366·9 c.c. The volume of astrakhanite = 334/2·22 = 150·5 c.c., and the volume of
13H<sub>2</sub>O = 234 c.c., hence their sum = 380·5 c.c., and therefore it is easy to follow the formation
of the astrakhanite in a suitable apparatus (a kind of thermometer containing oil and a
powdered mixture of sodium and magnesium sulphates), and to see by the variation in
volume that below 22° it remains unchanged, and at higher temperatures proceeds the
more quickly the higher the temperature. At the transition temperature the solubility
of astrakhanite and of the mixture of the component salts is one and the same, whilst at
higher temperatures a solution which is saturated for a mixture of the individual salts
would be supersaturated for astrakhanite, and at lower temperatures the solution of
astrakhanite will be supersaturated for the component salts, as has been shown with
especial detail by Karsten, Deacon, and others. Roozeboom showed that there are two
limits to the composition of the solutions which can exist for a double salt; these limits
are respectively obtained by dissolving a mixture of the double salt with each of its
component simple salts. Van't Hoff demonstrated, besides this, that the tendency
towards the formation of double salts has a distinct influence on the progress of double
decomposition, for at temperatures above 31° the mixture 2MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O + 2NaCl
passes into MgNa<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O + MgCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O + 4H<sub>2</sub>O, whilst below 31° there is not this
double decomposition, but it proceeds in the opposite direction, as may be demonstrated
by the above-described methods. Van der Heyd obtained a potassium astrakhanite,
K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>MgSO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O, from solutions of the component salts at 100°.</p>

<p>From these experiments on double salts we see that there is as close a dependence
between the temperature and the formation of substances as there is between the
temperature and a change of state. It is a case of Deville's principles of dissociation,
extended in the direction of the passage of a solid into a liquid. On the other
hand, we see here how essential a <i>rôle</i> water plays in the formation of compounds,
and how the affinity for water of crystallisation is essentially analogous to the
affinity between salts, and hence also to the affinity of acids for bases, because the
formation of double salts does not differ in any essential point (except the degree of
affinity&mdash;that is, from a quantitative aspect) from the formation of salts themselves.
When sodium hydroxide with nitric acid gives sodium nitrate and water the phenomenon
is essentially the same as in the formation of astrakhanite from the salts Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,10H<sub>2</sub>O
and MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O. Water is disengaged in both cases, and hence the volumes are altered.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_26_853" id="Footnote_26_853"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_853"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> This salt, and especially its crystallo-hydrate with 7H<sub>2</sub>O, is generally known as
Epsom salts. It has long been used as a purgative. It is easily obtained from magnesia
and sulphuric acid, and it separates on the evaporation of sea water and of many saline
springs. When carbonic anhydride is obtained by the action of sulphuric acid on
magnesite, magnesium sulphate remains in solution. When dolomite&mdash;that is, a mixture
of magnesium and calcium carbonates&mdash;is subjected to the action of a solution of hydrochloric
acid until about half of the salt remains, the calcium carbonate is mostly dissolved
and magnesium carbonate is left, which by treatment with sulphuric acid gives a
solution of magnesium sulphate.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_27_854" id="Footnote_27_854"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_854"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> The anhydrous salt, MgSO<sub>4</sub> (sp. gr. 2·61), attracts moisture (7 mol. H<sub>2</sub>O) from
moist air; when heated in steam or hydrogen chloride it gives sulphuric acid, and when
heated with carbon it is decomposed according to the equation 2MgSO<sub>4</sub> + C = 2SO<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>
+ 2MgO. The monohydrated salt (kieserite), MgSO<sub>4</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O (sp. gr. 2·56), dissolves in
water with difficulty; it is formed by heating the other crystallo-hydrates to 135°.
The hexahydrated salt is dimorphous. If a solution, saturated at the boiling-point,
be prepared, and cooled without access of crystals of the heptahydrated salt, then
MgSO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O crystallises out in <i>monoclinic</i> prisms (Loewel, Marignac), which are quite
as unstable as the salt, Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O; but if prismatic crystals of the cubic system
of the copper-nickel salts of the composition MSO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O be added, then crystals of
MgSO<sub>4</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O are deposited on them as prisms of the <i>cubic</i> system (Lecoq de Boisbaudran).
The common crystallo-hydrate, MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O, Epsom salts, belongs to the <i>rhombic</i>
system, and is obtained by crystallisation below 30°. Its specific gravity is 1·69. In a
vacuum, or at 100°, it loses 5H<sub>2</sub>O, at 132° 6H<sub>2</sub>O, and at 210° all the 7H<sub>2</sub>O (Graham). If
crystals of ferrous or cobaltic sulphate be placed in a saturated solution, <i>hexagonal</i>
crystals of the heptahydrated salt are formed (Lecoq de Boisbaudran); they present an
unstable state of equilibrium, and soon become cloudy, probably owing to their transformation
into the more stable common form. Fritzsche, by cooling saturated solutions
below 0°, obtained a mixture of crystals of ice and of a dodecahydrated salt, which easily
split up at temperatures above 0°. Guthrie showed that dilute solutions of magnesium
sulphate, when refrigerated, separate ice until the solution attains a composition
MgSO<sub>4</sub>,24H<sub>2</sub>O, which will completely freeze into a crystallo-hydrate at -5·3°. According
to Coppet and Rüdorff, the temperature of the formation of ice falls by 0·073° for every
part by weight of the heptahydrated salt per 100 of water. This figure gives (Chapter I.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_49_96">49</a>) <i>i</i> = 1 for both the heptahydrated and the anhydrous salt, from which it is evident
that it is impossible to judge the state of combination in which a dissolved substance
occurs by the temperature of the formation of ice.</p>

<p>The solubility of the different crystallo-hydrates of magnesium sulphate, according to
Loewel, also varies, like those of sodium sulphate or carbonate (<i>see</i> Chapter XII., Notes
<a href="#Footnote_7_725">7</a> and <a href="#Footnote_18_738">18</a>). At 0° 100 parts of water dissolves 40·75 MgSO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of the hexahydrated
salt, 34·67 MgSO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of the hexagonal heptahydrated salt, and
only 26 parts of MgSO<sub>4</sub> in the presence of the ordinary heptahydrated salt&mdash;that is,
solutions giving the remaining crystallo-hydrates will be supersaturated for the ordinary
heptahydrated salt.</p>

<p>All this shows how many diverse aspects of more or less stable equilibria may exist
between water and a substance dissolved in it; this has already been enlarged on in
Chapter <a href="#Page_40">I</a>.</p>

<p>Carefully purified magnesium sulphate in its aqueous solution gives, according to
Stcherbakoff, an alkaline reaction with litmus, and an acid reaction with phenolphthalein.</p>

<p>The specific gravity of solutions of certain salts of magnesium and calcium reduced
to 15°/4° (see my work cited, Chapter I., Note 1<a href="#Footnote_19_66">19</a>), are, if water at 4° = 10,000,</p>

the heptahydrated salt as that which is replaced by other salts, pointing out that double
salts like MgK<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O lose all their water at 135°, whilst MgSO<sub>4</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O only parts
with 6H<sub>2</sub>O.</p></div>

acid itself. Thus, for instance, if a carefully prepared mixture of equivalent quantities
of hydrated magnesium sulphate and sodium chloride be heated to redness, the evolution
of hydrochloric acid is observed just as in the action of sulphuric acid on common
salt, MgSO<sub>4</sub> + 2NaCl + H<sub>2</sub>O = Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> + MgO + 2HCl. Magnesium sulphate acts in a
similar manner on nitrates, with the evolution of nitric acid. A mixture of it with
common salt and manganese peroxide gives chlorine. Sulphuric acid is sometimes
replaced by magnesium sulphate in galvanic batteries&mdash;for example, in the well-known
Meidinger battery. In the above-mentioned reactions we see a striking example of the
similarity of the reactions of acids and salts, especially of salts which contain such feeble
bases as magnesia.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_33_860" id="Footnote_33_860"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_860"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> This decomposition is most simply defined as the result of the two reverse reactions,
MgCl<sub>2</sub> ÷ H<sub>2</sub>O = MgO + 2HCl and MgO + 2HCl = MgCl<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O, or as a distribution
between O and Cl<sub>2</sub> on the one hand and H<sub>2</sub> and Mg on the other. (With O, MgCl<sub>2</sub> gives
chlorine, <i>see</i> Chapter X., Note <a href="#Footnote_33_606">33</a>, and Chapter II., Note 3 bis and others, where the
reactions and applications of MgCl<sub>2</sub> are given.) It is then clear that, according to
Berthollet's doctrine, the mass of the hydrochloric acid converts the magnesium oxide
into chloride, and the mass of the water converts the magnesium chloride into oxide.
The crystallo-hydrate, MgCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O, forms the limit of the reversibility. But an intermediate
state of equilibrium may exist in the form of basic salts. On mixing ignited
magnesia with a solution of magnesium chloride of specific gravity about 1·2, a solid
mass is obtained which is scarcely decomposed by water at the ordinary temperature
(<i>see</i> Chapter XVI., Note 4). A similar means is employed for cementing sawdust into
a solid mass, called cylolite, used for flooring, &amp;c.</p>

<p>We may remark that MgBr<sub>2</sub> crystallises not only with 6H<sub>2</sub>O (temperature of fusion

extracted from dolomite by burning it, slaking the mixture of oxides thus obtained, and
adding a 10 p.c. solution of sugar. Carbonic anhydride precipitates calcium carbonate
from this solution. The addition of sugar (molasses) to the lime used for building
purposes powerfully increases the binding power of the mortar, as I have myself found.
I have been told that in the East (India, Japan) the addition of sugar to cement has long

soluble salt (at 20° one part of the salt requires 0·49 part and at 43° 0·35 part of water
for solution), is deliquescent in the air, and resembles calcium chloride in many respects.
It changes but little when evaporated, and like calcium chloride fuses when heated, and
therefore all the water may be driven off by heat. If anhydrous calcium iodide be heated
with an equivalent quantity of sodium in a closely covered iron crucible, sodium iodide
and metallic calcium are formed (Liés-Bodart). Dumas advises carrying on this
reaction in a closed space under pressure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_38_866" id="Footnote_38_866"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_866"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Kilns which act either intermittently or continuously are built for this purpose.
Those of the first kind are filled with alternate layers of fuel and limestone; the
fuel is lighted, and the heat developed by its combustion serves for decomposing the
limestone. When the process is completed the kiln is allowed to cool somewhat, the lime
raked out, and the same process repeated. In the continuously acting furnaces, constructed
like that shown in fig. <a href="#fig_78">78</a>, the kiln itself only contains limestone, and there are
lateral hearths for burning the fuel, whose flame passes through the limestone and
serves for its decomposition. Such furnaces are able to work continuously, because the
unburnt limestone may be charged from above and the burnt lime raked out from below.
It is not every limestone that is suitable for the preparation of lime, because many
contain impurities, principally clay, dolomite, and sand. Such limestones when burnt
either fuse partially or give an impure lime, called <i>poor</i> lime in distinction from that
obtained from purer limestone, which is called <i>rich</i> lime. The latter kind is characterised
by its disintegrating into a fine powder when treated with water, and is
suitable for the majority of uses to which lime is applied, and for which the poor lime
is sometimes quite unfit. However, certain kinds of poor lime (as we shall see in
Chapter XVIII., Note 25) are used in the preparation of hydraulic cements, which
solidify into a hard mass under water.</p>

<p>In order to obtain perfectly pure lime it is necessary to take the purest possible
materials. In the laboratory, marble or shells are used for this purpose as a pure form
of calcium carbonate. They are first burnt in a furnace, then put in a crucible and
moistened with a small quantity of water, and finally strongly ignited, by which
means a pure lime is obtained. Pure lime may be more rapidly prepared by taking
calcium nitrate, CaN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>, which is easily obtained by dissolving limestone in nitric acid.
The solution obtained is boiled with a small quantity of lime in order to precipitate the
foreign oxides which are insoluble in water. The oxides of iron, aluminium, &amp;c., are
precipitated by this means. The salt is then crystallised and ignited: CaN<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>
= CaO + 2NO<sub>2</sub> + O.</p>

<p>In the decomposition of calcium carbonate the lime preserves the form of the lumps
subjected to ignition; this is one of the signs distinguishing quicklime when it is freshly
burnt and unaltered by air. It attracts moisture from the air and then disintegrates
to a powder; if left long exposed in the air, it also attracts carbonic anhydride and
increases in volume; it does not entirely pass into carbonate, but forms a compound of
the latter with caustic lime.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_39_867" id="Footnote_39_867"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_867"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Lime, when raised to a white heat in the vapour of potassium, gives calcium, and
in chlorine it gives off oxygen. Sulphur, phosphorus, &amp;c., when heated with lime, are
absorbed by it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40_868" id="Footnote_40_868"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_868"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> The greater quantity of lime is used in making mortar for binding bricks or stones
together, in the form of <i>lime</i> or <i>cement</i>, or the so-called <i>slaked lime</i>. For this purpose
the lime is mixed with water and sand, which serves to separate the particles of lime
from each other. If only lime paste were put between two bricks they would not hold
firmly together, because after the water had evaporated the lime would occupy a smaller
space than before, and therefore cracks and powder would form in its mass, so that it would
not at all produce that complete cementation of the bricks which it is desired to attain.
Pieces of stone&mdash;that is, sand&mdash;mixed with the lime hinder this process of disintegration,
because the lime binds together the individual grains of sand mixed with it, and forms
one concrete mass, in consequence of a process which proceeds after the desiccation or
removal of the water. The process of the solidification of lime, taken as slaked lime,
consists first in the direct evaporation of the water and crystallisation of the hydrate, so
that the lime binds the stones and sand mixed with it, just as glue binds two pieces of
wood. But this preliminary binding action of lime is feeble (as is seen by direct experiment)
unless there be further alteration of the lime leading to the formation of carbonates,
silicates, and other salts of calcium which are distinguished by their great cohesiveness.
With the progress of time the cement is partially subjected to the action of the carbonic
anhydride in the air, owing to which calcium carbonate is formed, but not more than half
the lime is thus converted into carbonate. Besides which, the lime partially acts on the
silica of the bricks, and it is owing to these new combinations simultaneously forming
in the cement that it gradually becomes stronger and stronger. Hence the binding action
of the lime becomes stronger with the lapse of time. This is the reason (and not, as is
sometimes said, because the ancients knew how to build stronger than we do) why buildings
which have stood for centuries possess a very strongly binding cement. Hydraulic
cements will be described later (Chapter XVIII., Note 25).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_869" id="Footnote_41_869"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_869"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Professor Glinka measured the transparent bright crystals of calcium hydroxide
which are formed in common hydraulic (Portland) cement.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42_870" id="Footnote_42_870"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_870"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> The act of heating brings the substance into that state of internal motion which is
required for reaction. It should be considered that by the act of heating not only is the
bond between the parts, or cohesion of the molecules, altered (generally diminished),
not only is the motion or store of energy of the whole molecule increased, but also that in
all probability the motion of the atoms themselves in molecules undergoes a change. The
same kind of change is accomplished by the act of solution, or of combination in general,
judging from the fact that a dissolved or combined substance&mdash;for instance, lime with
water&mdash;reacts on carbonic anhydride as it does under the action of heat. For the
comprehension of chemical phenomena it is exceedingly useful to recognise clearly this
parallelism. Rose's observation on the formation (by the slow diffusion of solutions of
calcium chloride and sodium carbonate) of aragonite from dilute, and of calc spar from
strong, solutions is easily understood from this point of view. As aragonite is always
formed from hot solutions, it appears that dilution with water acts like heat. The following
experiment of Kühlmann is particularly instructive in this sense. Anhydrous (perfectly
dry) barium oxide does not react with monohydrated sulphuric acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> (containing
neither free water nor anhydride, SO<sub>3</sub>). But if either an incandescent object or a moist
substance is brought into contact with the mixture a violent reaction immediately begins
(it is essentially the same as combustion), and the whole mass reacts.</p>

<p>The influence of solution on the process of reaction is instructively illustrated by the
following experiment. Lime, or barium oxide, is placed in a flask or retort having an
upper orifice and connected with a tube immersed in mercury. A funnel furnished with
a stopcock and filled with water is fixed into the upper orifice of the retort, which is then
filled with dry carbonic anhydride. There is no absorption. When a constant temperature
is arrived at, the unslaked oxide is made to absorb all the carbonic anhydride
by carefully admitting water. A vacuum is formed, as is seen by the mercury rising
in the neck of the retort. With water the absorption goes on to the end, whilst under
the action of heat there remains the dissociating tension of the carbonic anhydride.
Furthermore, we here see that, with a certain resemblance, there is also a distinction,
depending on the fact that at low temperatures calcium carbonate does not dissociate;
this determines the complete absorption of the carbonic anhydride in the aqueous
solution.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43_871" id="Footnote_43_871"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_871"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Experience has shown that by moistening partially-burnt lime with water and reheating
it, it is easy to drive off the last traces of carbonic anhydride from it, and that,
in general, by blowing air or steam through the lime, and even by using moist fuel, it is
possible to accelerate the decomposition of the calcium carbonate. The partial pressure
is decreased by these means.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44_872" id="Footnote_44_872"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_872"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> Before the introduction of Deville's theory of dissociation, the <i>modus operandi</i> of
decompositions like that under consideration was understood in the sense that decomposition
starts at a certain temperature, and that it is accelerated by a rise of temperature,
but it was not considered possible that combination could proceed at the same temperature
as that at which decomposition goes on. Berthollet and Deville introduced the conception
of equilibrium into chemical science, and elucidated the question of reversible reactions.
Naturally the subject is still far from being clear&mdash;the questions of the rate and completeness
of reaction, of contact, &amp;c., still intrude themselves&mdash;but an important step has
been made in chemical mechanics, and we have started on a new path which promises
further progress, towards which much has been done not only by Deville himself, but more
especially by the French chemists Debray, Troost, Lemoine, Hautefeuille, Le Chatelier,
and others. Among other things those investigators have shown the close resemblance
between the phenomena of evaporation and dissociation, and pointed out that the amount
of heat absorbed by a dissociating substance may be calculated according to the law of
the variation of dissociation-pressure, in exactly the same manner as it is possible to
calculate the latent heat of the evaporation of water, knowing the variation of the tension
with the temperature, on the basis of the second law of the mechanical theory of heat.
Details of this subject must be looked for in special works on physical chemistry. <i>One
and the same conception</i> of the mechanical theory of heat <i>is applicable to dissociation</i>
and <i>evaporation</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_45_873" id="Footnote_45_873"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_873"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> But the question as to the formation of a basic calcium carbonate with a rise of
temperature still remains undecided. The presence of water complicates all the relations
between lime and carbonic anhydride, all the more as the existence of an attraction
between calcium carbonate and water is seen from its being able to give a <i>crystallo-hydrate</i>,
CaCO<sub>3</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O (Pelouze), which crystallises in rhombic prisms of sp. gr. about
1·77 and loses its water at 20°. These crystals are obtained when a solution of lime in
sugar and water is left long exposed to the air and slowly attracts carbonic anhydride
from it, and also by the evaporation of such a solution at a temperature of about 3°.
On the other band, it is probable that an <i>acid salt</i>, CaH<sub>2</sub>(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, is formed in an aqueous
solution, not only because water containing carbonic acid dissolves calcium carbonate,
but more especially in view of the researches of Schloesing (1872), which showed that
at 16° a litre of water in an atmosphere of carbonic anhydride (pressure 0·984 atmosphere)
dissolves 1·086 gram of calcium carbonate and 1·778 gram of carbonic anhydride,
which corresponds with the formation of calcium hydrogen carbonate, and the solution
of carbonic anhydride in the remaining water. Caro showed that a litre of water is able
to dissolve as much as 3 grams of calcium carbonate if the pressure be increased to 4 and
more atmospheres. The calcium carbonate is precipitated when the carbonic anhydride
passes off in the air or in a current of another gas; this also takes place in many natural
springs. Tufa, stalactites, and other like formations from waters containing calcium
carbonate and carbonic acid in solution are formed in this manner. The solubility of
calcium carbonate itself at the ordinary temperature does not exceed 13 milligrams per
litre of water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_46_874" id="Footnote_46_874"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_874"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> Dimorphous bodies differ from true isomers and polymers in that they do not
differ in their chemical reactions, which are determined by a difference in the distribution
(motion) of the atoms in the molecules, and therefore dimorphism is usually
ascribed to a difference in the distribution of similar molecules, building up a crystal.
Although such a hypothesis is quite admissible in the spirit of the atomic and molecular
theory, yet, as in such a redistribution of the molecules a perfect conservation of the
distribution of the atoms in them cannot be imagined, and in every effort of chemical
reaction there must take place a certain motion among the atoms; so in my opinion there
is no firm basis for distinguishing dimorphism from the general conception of isomerism,
under which the cases of those organic bodies which are dextro and lævo rotatory (with
respect to polarised light) have recently been brought with such brilliant success. When
calcium carbonate separates out from solutions, it has at first a gelatinous appearance,
which leads to the supposition that this salt appears in a colloidal state. It only crystallises
with the progress of time. The colloidal state of calcium carbonate is particularly
clear from the following observations made by Prof. Famintzin, who showed
that when it separates from solutions it is obtained under certain conditions in the form
of grains having the peculiar paste-like structure proper to starch, which fact has not
only an independent interest, but presents an example of a mineral substance being
obtained in a form until then only known in the organic substances elaborated in plants.
This shows that the forms (cells, vessels, &amp;c.) in which vegetable and animal substances
occur in organisms do not present in themselves anything peculiar to organisms, but are
only the result of those particular conditions in which these substances are formed.
Traube and afterwards Monnier and Vogt (1882) obtained formations which, under the
microscope, were in every respect identical in appearance with vegetable cells, by means
of a similar slow formation of precipitates (by reacting on sulphates of different metals
with sodium silicate or carbonate).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_47_875" id="Footnote_47_875"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47_875"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> According to Le Chatelier (1888), 1&frac12;H<sub>2</sub>O is lost at 120°&mdash;that is, H<sub>2</sub>O,2CaSO<sub>4</sub> is
formed, but at 194° all the water is expelled. According to Shenstone and Cundall
(1888) gypsum begins to lose water at 70° in dry air. The semi-hydrated compound
H<sub>2</sub>O,2CaSO<sub>4</sub> is also formed when gypsum is heated with water in a closed vessel at
150° (Hoppe-Seyler).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_48_876" id="Footnote_48_876"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_876"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> For stucco-work it is usual to add lime and sand, as the mass is then harder and
does not solidify so quickly. For imitating marble, glue is added to the plaster, and the
mass is polished when thoroughly dry. Re-burnt gypsum cannot be used over again, as
that which has once solidified is, like the natural anhydride, not able to recombine with
water. It is evident that the structure of the molecules in the crystallised mass, or in
general in any dense mass, exerts an influence on the chemical action, which is more
particularly evident in metals in their different forms (powder, crystalline, rolled, &amp;c.)</p></div>

2·577, and heated to its point of fusion, 2·654. Potilitzin (1894) also admits the two
above-named modifications of anhydrous gypsum, which, moreover, always contain the
semi-hydrated hydrate (Note <a href="#Footnote_47_875">47</a>), and he explains by their relation to water the
phenomena observed in the solidification of a mixture of burnt gypsum and water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_49_878" id="Footnote_49_878"></a><a href="#FNanchor_49_878"><span class="label">[49]</span></a> As Marignac showed, gypsum, especially when desiccated at 120°, easily gives supersaturated
solutions with respect to CaSO<sub>4</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, which contain as much as 1 part of
CaSO<sub>4</sub> to 110 parts of water. Boiling dilute hydrochloric acid dissolves gypsum,
forming calcium chloride. The behaviour of gypsum towards the alkaline carbonates
has been described in Chapter <a href="#Page_417">X</a>. Alcohol precipitates gypsum from its aqueous
solutions, because, like the sulphates in general, it is sparingly soluble in alcohol.
Gypsum, like all the sulphates, when heated with charcoal, gives up its oxygen, forming
the sulphide, CaS.</p>

<p>Calcium sulphate, like magnesium sulphate, is capable of forming double salts, but
with difficulty, and they are chemically less stable. They contain, as is always the case
with double salts, less water of crystallisation than the component salts. Rose, Struvé,
and others obtained the salt CaK<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O; a mixture of gypsum with an equivalent
amount of potassium sulphate and water solidifies into a homogeneous mass. Fritzsche
obtained the corresponding sodium salt in a hydrated and anhydrous state, by heating a
mixture of gypsum with a saturated solution of sodium sulphate. The anhydrous salt
occurs in nature as <i>glauberite</i>. Fritzsche also obtained <i>gaylussite</i>, Na<sub>2</sub>Ca(CO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,5H<sub>2</sub>O,
by pouring a saturated solution of sodium carbonate on to freshly-precipitated calcium
carbonate. Calcium also forms basic salts, but only a few. Veeren (1892) obtained
Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>,2&frac12;H<sub>2</sub>O by leaving powdered caustic lime in a saturated solution of
Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> until it solidified. This salt is decomposed by water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_50_879" id="Footnote_50_879"></a><a href="#FNanchor_50_879"><span class="label">[50]</span></a> Calcium chloride has a specific gravity 2·20, or, when fused, 2·12, and the sp. gr. of
the crystallised salt CaCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O is 1·69. If the volume of the crystals at 0° = 1, then at
29° it is 1·020, and the volume of the fused mass at the same temperature is 1·118 (Kopp)
(specific gravity of solutions, <i>see</i> Note <a href="#Footnote_27_854">27</a>). The solution containing 50 p.c. CaCl<sub>2</sub> boils
at 130°, 70 p.c. at 158°. Superheated steam decomposes calcium chloride with more difficulty
than magnesium chloride and with greater ease than barium chloride (Kuhnheim).
Sodium does not decompose fused calcium chloride even on prolonged heating (Liés-Bodart),
but an alloy of sodium with zinc, lead, and bismuth decomposes it, forming an
alloy of calcium with one of the above-named metals (Caron). The zinc alloy may be
obtained with as much as 15 p.c. of calcium. Calcium chloride is soluble in alcohol and
absorbs ammonia.</p>

<p>A gram molecular weight of calcium chloride in dissolving in an excess of water
evolves 18,723 calories, and in dissolving in alcohol 17,555 units of heat, according to
Pickering.</p>

<p>Roozeboom made detailed researches on the crystallo-hydrates of calcium chloride
(1889), and found that CaCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O melts at 30·2°, and is formed at low temperatures from
solutions containing not more than 103 parts of calcium chloride per 100 parts of water;
if the amount of salt (always to 100 parts of water) reaches 120 parts, then tabular
crystals of CaCl<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O&#946; are formed, which at temperatures above 38·4° are converted
into the crystallo-hydrates CaCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O, whilst at temperatures below 18° the &#946; variety
passes into the more stable CaCl<sub>2</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O&#945;, which process is aided by mechanical friction.
Hence, as is the case with magnesium sulphate (Note <a href="#Footnote_27_854">27</a>), one and the same crystallo-hydrate
appears in two forms&mdash;the &#946;, which is easily produced but is unstable, and
the &#945;, which is stable. The solubility of the above-mentioned hydrates of chloride
of calcium, or amount of calcium chloride per 100 parts of water, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>The amount of calcium chloride to 100 parts of water in the crystallo-hydrate is
given in brackets. The point of intersection of the curves of solubility lies at about
30° for the first two salts and about 45° for the salts with 4H<sub>2</sub>O and 2H<sub>2</sub>O. The crystals
CaCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O may, however, be obtained (Ditte) at the ordinary temperature from solutions
containing hydrochloric acid. The vapour tension of this crystallo-hydrate equals
the atmospheric at 165°, and therefore the crystals may be dried in an atmosphere of
steam and obtained without a mother liquor, whose vapour tension is greater. This
crystallo-hydrate decomposes at about 175° into CaCl<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O and a solution; this is easily
brought about in a closed vessel when the pressure is greater than the atmosphere.

<p>Solutions of calcium chloride may serve as a convenient example for the study of the
supersaturated state, which in this case easily occurs, because different hydrates are
formed. Thus at 25° solutions containing more than 83 parts of anhydrous calcium
chloride per 100 of water will be supersaturated for the hydrate CaCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Hammerl showed that solutions of calcium chloride, when frozen,
deposit ice if they contain less than 43 parts of salt per 100 of water, and if more the
crystallo-hydrate CaCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O separates, and that a solution of the above composition

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_52_881" id="Footnote_52_881"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_881"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> Barium sulphide is decomposed by water, BaS + 2H<sub>2</sub>O = H<sub>2</sub>S + Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> (the reaction
is reversible), but both substances are soluble in water, and their separation is complicated
by the fact that barium sulphide absorbs oxygen and gives insoluble barium
sulphate. The hydrogen sulphide is sometimes removed from the solution by boiling
with the oxides of copper or zinc. If sugar be added to a solution of barium sulphide,
barium saccharate is precipitated on heating; it is decomposed by carbonic anhydride,
so that barium carbonate is formed. An equivalent mixture of sodium sulphate
with barium or strontium sulphates when ignited with charcoal gives a mixture of
sodium sulphide and barium or strontium sulphide, and if this mixture be dissolved in
water and the solution evaporated, barium or strontium hydroxide crystallises out
on cooling, and sodium hydrosulphide, NaHS, is obtained in solution. The hydroxides
BaH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and SrH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are prepared on a large scale, being applied to many reactions; for
example, strontium hydroxide is prepared for sugar works for extracting crystallisable
sugar from molasses.</p>

<p>We may remark that Boussingault, by igniting barium sulphate in hydrochloric acid
gas, obtained a complete decomposition, with the formation of barium chloride. Attention
should also be turned to the fact that Grouven, by beating a mixture of charcoal and
strontium sulphate with magnesium and potassium sulphates, showed the easy decomposability
depending on the formation of double salts, such as SrS,K<sub>2</sub>S, which are easily
soluble in water, and give a precipitate of strontium carbonate with carbonic anhydride.
In such examples as these we see that the force which binds double salts may play a part
in directing the course of reactions, and the number of double salts of silica on the earth's
surface shows that nature takes advantage of these forces in her chemical processes. It
is worthy of remark that Buchner (1893), by mixing a 40 per cent. solution of barium
acetate with a 60 per cent. solution of sulphate of alumina, obtained a thick glutinous
mass, which only gave a precipitate of BaSO<sub>4</sub> after being diluted with water.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_53_882" id="Footnote_53_882"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_882"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> Barium sulphate is sometimes converted into barium chloride in the following
manner: finely-ground barium sulphate is heated with coal and manganese chloride
(the residue from the manufacture of chlorine). The mass becomes semi-liquid,
and when it evolves carbonic oxide the heating is stopped. The following double decompositions
proceed during this operation: first the carbon takes up the oxygen from the
barium sulphate, and gives sulphide, BaS, which enters into double decomposition with
the chloride of manganese, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, forming manganese sulphide, MnS, which is insoluble
in water, and soluble barium chloride. This solution is easily obtained pure because
many foreign impurities, such as iron, remain in the insoluble portion with the manganese.
The solution of barium chloride is chiefly used for the preparation of barium
sulphate, which is precipitated by sulphuric acid, by which means <i>barium sulphate</i> is
re-formed as a powder. This salt is characterised by the fact that it is unacted on by
the majority of chemical reagents, is insoluble in water, and is not dissolved by acids.
Owing to this, artificial barium sulphate forms a permanent white paint which is used
instead of (and mixed with) white lead, and has been termed &lsquo;blanc fixé&rsquo; or &lsquo;permanent
white.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The solution of one part of calcium chloride at 20° requires 1·36 part of water, the
solution of one part of strontium chloride requires 1·88 part of water at the same temperature,
and the solution of barium chloride 2·88 parts of water. The solubility of the
bromides and iodides varies in the same proportion. The chlorides of barium and strontium
crystallise out from solution with great ease in combination with water; they form
BaCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O and SrCl<sub>2</sub>,6H<sub>2</sub>O. The latter (which separates out at 40°) resembles the
salts of Ca and Mg in composition, and Étard (1892) obtained SrCl<sub>2</sub>,2H<sub>2</sub>O from solutions
at 90&ndash;130°. We may also observe that the crystallo-hydrates BaBr<sub>2</sub>,H<sub>2</sub>O and BaI<sub>2</sub>,7H<sub>2</sub>O
are known.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_54_883" id="Footnote_54_883"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_883"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> The nitrates Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> (in the cold its solutions give a crystallo-hydrate containing
4H<sub>2</sub>O) and Ba(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> are so very sparingly soluble in water that they separate in considerable
quantities when a solution of sodium nitrate is added to a strong solution of either
barium or strontium chloride. They are obtained by the action of nitric acid on the carbonates
or oxides. 100 parts of water at 15° dissolve 6·5 parts of strontium nitrate and 8·2
parts of barium nitrate, whilst more than 300 parts of calcium nitrate are soluble at the
same temperature. Strontium nitrate communicates a crimson coloration to the flame of
burning substances, and is therefore frequently used for Bengal fire, fireworks, and signal
lights, for which purpose the salts of lithium are still better fitted. Calcium nitrate is
exceedingly hygroscopic. Barium nitrate, on the contrary, does not show this property
in the least degree, and in this respect it resembles potassium nitrate, and is therefore
used instead of the latter for the preparation of a gunpowder which is called &lsquo;saxifragin
powder&rsquo; (76 parts of barium nitrate, 2 parts of nitre, and 22 parts of charcoal).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_59_889" id="Footnote_59_889"></a><a href="#FNanchor_59_889"><span class="label">[59]</span></a> We refer beryllium to the class of the bivalent metals of the alkaline earths&mdash;that
is, we ascribe to its oxide the formula BeO, and do not consider it as trivalent (Be = 13·5,
Chapter VII., Note <a href="#Footnote_21_430">21</a>), although that view has been upheld by many chemists. The true
atomic composition of beryllium oxide was first given by the Russian chemist, Avdéeff
(1819), in his researches on the compounds of this metal. He compared the compounds of
beryllium to those of magnesium, and refuted the notion prevalent at the time, of the
resemblance between the oxides of beryllium and aluminium, by proving that beryllium
sulphate presents a greater resemblance to magnesium sulphate than to aluminium
sulphate. It was especially noticed that the analogues of alumina give alums, whilst
beryllium oxide, although it is a feeble base, easily giving, like magnesia, basic and
double salts, does not form true alums. The establishment of the periodic system of the
elements (1869), considered in the following chapter, immediately indicated that
Avdéeff's view corresponded with the truth&mdash;that is, that beryllium is bivalent,
which therefore necessitated the denial of its trivalency. This scientific controversy
resulted in a long series of researches (1870&ndash;80) concerning this element, and ended in
Nilson and Pettersson&mdash;two of the chief advocates of the trivalency of beryllium&mdash;determining
the vapour density of BeCl<sub>2</sub> = 40, (Chapter VII., Note <a href="#Footnote_21_430">21</a>), which gave an
undoubted proof of its bivalency (<i>see</i> also Note <a href="#Footnote_3_830">3</a>).</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_60_890" id="Footnote_60_890"></a><a href="#FNanchor_60_890"><span class="label">[60]</span></a> Beryllium oxide, like aluminium oxide, is precipitated from solutions of its salts
by alkalis as a gelatinous hydroxide, BeH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which, like alumina, is soluble in an excess
of caustic potash or soda. This reaction may be taken advantage of for distinguishing
and separating beryllium from aluminium, because when the alkaline solution is diluted
with water and boiled, beryllium hydroxide is precipitated, whilst the alumina remains
in solution. The solubility of the beryllium oxide at once clearly indicates its feeble
basic properties, and, as it were, separates this oxide from the class of the alkaline earths.
But on arranging the oxides of the above-described metals of the alkaline earths according
to their decreasing atomic weights we have the series</p>

<p class="title">BaO,  SrO,  CaO,  MgO,  BeO,</p>

<p class="noindent">in which the basic properties and solubility of the oxides consecutively and distinctly
decrease until we reach a point when, had we not known of the existence of the beryllium
oxide, we should expect to find in its place an oxide insoluble in water and of feeble basic
properties. If an alcoholic solution of caustic potash be saturated with the hydrate of
BeO, and evaporated under the receiver of an air pump, it forms silky crystals BeK<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of the salts of beryllium is that they give with aqueous ammonia
a gelatinous precipitate which is soluble in an excess of ammonium carbonate
like the precipitate of magnesia; in this beryllium oxide differs from the oxide of
aluminium. Beryllium oxide easily forms a carbonate which is insoluble in water, and
resembles magnesium carbonate in many respects. Beryllium sulphate is distinguished
by its considerable solubility in water&mdash;thus, at the ordinary temperature it dissolves
in an equal weight of water; it crystallises out from its solutions in well-formed crystals,
which do not change in the air, and contain BeSO<sub>4</sub>,4H<sub>2</sub>O. When ignited it leaves
beryllium oxide, but this oxide, after prolonged ignition, is re-dissolved by sulphuric acid,
whilst aluminium sulphate, after a similar treatment, leaves aluminium oxide, which is
no longer soluble in acids. With a few exceptions, the salts of beryllium crystallise with
great difficulty, and to a considerable extent resemble the salts of magnesium; thus, for
instance, beryllium chloride is analogous to magnesium chloride. It is volatile in an
anhydrous state, and in a hydrated state it decomposes, with the evolution of hydrochloric
acid.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_61_891" id="Footnote_61_891"></a><a href="#FNanchor_61_891"><span class="label">[61]</span></a> Thus in the nitrides of the metals we have substances by means of which we can
easily obtain from the nitrogen of the air, not only ammonia, but also with the aid of
CO, by synthesis, a whole series of complex carbon and nitrogen compounds.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_62_892" id="Footnote_62_892"></a><a href="#FNanchor_62_892"><span class="label">[62]</span></a> As the hydrides of calcium, magnesium, &amp;c. are very stable under the action of
heat, and these metals and hydrogen occur in the sun, it is likely that the formation of
their hydrides may take place there. (Private communication from Prof. Winkler, 1894.)
It is probable that in the free metals of the alkaline earths hitherto obtained a portion
was frequently in combination with nitrogen and hydrogen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_63_893" id="Footnote_63_893"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_893"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> Thus, for instance, a mixture of 56 parts of CaO and 24 parts of magnesium powder
is heated in an iron pipe (placed over a row of gas burners as in the combustion furnace
used for organic analysis) in a stream of hydrogen. After being heated for &frac12; hour the
mixture is found to absorb hydrogen (it no longer passes over the mixture, but is retained
by it). The product, which is light grey, and slightly coherent, disengages a mass of
hydrogen when water is poured over it, and burns when heated in air. The resultant
mass contains 33 per cent. CaH, about 28 per cent. CaO, and about 38 per cent. MgO.
Neither CaH nor any other MH has yet been obtained in a pure state.</p>

<p>The acetylene derivatives of the metals of the alkaline earths C<sub>2</sub>M (Chapter VIII.,
Note <a href="#Footnote_12_BIS_454">12 bis</a>), for instance, C<sub>2</sub>Ba, obtained by Maquenne and Moissan, belong to the same
class of analogous compounds. It must here be remarked that the oxides MO of the
metals of the alkaline earths, although not reducible by carbon at a furnace heat, yet
under the action of the heat attained in electrical furnaces, not only give up their oxygen
to carbon (probably partly owing to the action of the current), but also combine with carbon.
The resultant compounds, C<sub>2</sub>M, evolve acetylene, C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, with HCl, just as N<sub>2</sub>M<sub>3</sub>
give ammonia. We may remark moreover that the series of compounds of the metals of
the alkaline earths with hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon is a discovery of recent years, and
that probably further research will give rise to similar unexpected compounds, and by
extending our knowledge of their reactions prove to be of great interest.</p></div>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
